1,dust aerosol,"Identifying errors in dust models from data assimilation. Airborne mineral dust is an important component of the Earth system and is increasingly predicted prognostically in weather and climate models. The recent development of data assimilation for remotely sensed aerosol optical depths AODs into models offers a new opportunity to better understand the characteristics and sources of model error. Here we examine assimilation increments from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AODs over northern Africa in the Met Office global forecast model. The model underpredicts overpredicts dust in light strong winds, consistent with submesoscale mesoscale processes lifting dust in reality but being missed by the model. Dust is overpredicted in the Sahara and underpredicted in the Sahel. Using observations of lighting and rain, we show that haboobs cold pool outflows from moist convection are an important dust source in reality but are badly handled by the model's convection scheme. The approach shows promise to serve as a useful framework for future model development. Mineral dust is an important component of the Earth system, scattering and absorbing both solar and infrared radiation and affecting cloud microphysics. Dust is increasingly being predicted prognostically within numerical weather prediction NWP models because of its impacts on atmospheric circulation and the boundary layer BL . In addition, many applications such as visibility e.g., aviation and military activities , air quality, solar energy production, and health respiratory diseases and meningitis outbreaks use dust forecasts. In recent years dust models have started to assimilate aerosol optical depth AOD from satellite measurements. The resulting data assimilation increments DAIs , i.e., the amount of change made to the first guess by the model through the incorporation of observations, present a new opportunity to assess the characteristics and sources of error in dust models, as shown in this study.Dust emission results from wind stress over dry surfaces with adequate soil characteristics. Associated meteorological phenomena include haboobs dusty cold pool outflows from deep convective precipitating events initiated in the Sahel and Sahara during the monsoon season , small-scale dry convective processes such as dust devils and dusty plumes DD , and the breakdown of the nocturnal low-level jet NLLJ . Haboobs and NLLJs appear to account for similar amounts of dust emission over West Africa in summer approximately 40 to 50% , while DDs account for 3.4% uncertainty range 0.9–31% of the global dust emission. During the dry season the synoptic-scale northeasterly Harmattan winds, and the breakdown of the NLLJ within them, cause significant dust uplift especially from the Bodélé Depression. Seasonally changing land surface properties e.g., soil moisture and vegetation also control dust emission, especially in the Sahel.Model uncertainties in the dust cycle are large. For a multimodel ensemble, estimated annual global dust emission and deposition to be 200–4000 Tg/yr and 700–4000 Tg/yr, respectively. Observational studies have also found large uncertainties in quantifying dust emission and deposition, and recently, attempts have been made to use data assimilation to better constrain dust emissions. The differences in modeled emissions are attributed to uncertainty in dust parameterizations e.g., particle entrainment and suspension , the land surface, and representation of model meteorology, often a dominating factor. The relationship between wind speed and dust emission is highly nonlinear and usually represented as the third power of the difference between surface wind speed and a fixed threshold friction velocity, making it sensitive to the tail of the wind speed distribution. Global models are known to underestimate the dust-lifting power of wind. and found that meteorological analyses underestimate the stronger NLLJs seen in radiosonde observations. In operational dust models parameterized convection leads to missing haboobs and DDs are too small for all NWP models.From 30 April 2013 the UK Met Office started assimilating AOD at 550 nm, from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS instrument aboard NASAs EOS-AQUA satellite, into its global NWP model. A full year of simulation is used to investigate model error, specifically concentrating on high- and low-wind regimes and haboobs over northern Africa. Section 2 gives a description of the model, assimilation methodology, and the observational data. In section 3 the model AOD and DAI AOD are systematically investigated. Conclusions are provided in section 4 .We use a global configuration of the Met Office Unified Model MetUM . The MetUM has a nonhydrostatic, fully compressible, deep-atmosphere dynamical core, solved with a semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian time step on a regular longitudinal-latitudinal grid. The scientific documentation of the MetUM configuration during this period is the Global Atmosphere 3.1 described in detail in. Of particular relevance to this study are the parameterizations of turbulent mixing and convection. The former is parameterized using the first-order scheme of with additional nonlocal fluxes in convective boundary layers and an explicit parameterization of entrainment mixing across the boundary layer top. This produces a surface friction velocity , but the impact of this is small. Over West Africa these parameterizations are known to produce rainfall too early in the day, change the sign in the soil moisture rainfall coupling, and are unable to produce convectively generated cold pools important for convective organization and dust uplift.The model was run with a horizontal grid spacing of 0.35° longitude by 0.23° latitude approximately 25 km in midlatitudes and 40 km at the equator , with 70 levels between the surface and 80 km, with terrain-following coordinates close to the surface and parallel levels at height. Meteorological fields are initialized from initial conditions from 3 h into the previous forecast data, while the bare soil roughness length is a constant global value of 1 mm. The land fractions for the nonvegetated surface types and the different JULES plant-functional types are derived from the International Global Biosphere Programme, as is an estimate of the plant canopy heights and therefore the vegetation roughness lengths. The leaf area index LAI is updated at the start of every forecast from a monthly climatology derived from MODIS observations. Therefore, LAI and surface roughness evolve through the seasonal cycle while bare soil fraction does not.While the Woodward dust model has a sound physical basis, its final performance is dependent on three tuning parameters: one scales the model soil moisture to account for the difference between a model soil level 10 cm deep and the thin surface layer which is relevant for dust emission. The second scales the input U * to account for changes in the wind distribution at different model resolutions or surface roughness specifications, and the final tuning parameter globally scales the dust emission. The representation of wet and dry deposition processes is as described in Woodward , with coefficients modified for the two transported size bins.Model initial conditions were available at T + 3 Z 03, 09, 15, and 21 UTC and T + 6 Z 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC , respectively, and DAIs at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC. The DAIs are based on the assimilation of MODIS AOD, which include collection 5.1 C5 standard MODIS dark target retrievals over land and sea and Deep Blue retrievals over desert and arid land surface. In order to remove nondust aerosol AOD observations, the MODIS dark target observations are filtered using the aerosol-type indicators within the MODIS data files, and the Deep Blue observations are currently assumed to be of dust as these are over desert/arid land surfaces. AQUA has an approximate overpass time of 1330 LT, such that DAIs with useful information are those at 12 UTC. We use these DAIs to assess the dust forecast errors over 1 year, for Africa north of the equator, between 1 May 2013 and 30 April 2014. We focus on the monsoon May–September and nonmonsoon October–April seasons. The assimilation calculates DAIs on all model levels, based on the AOD column measurement. Therefore, column integrals of the DAIs are presented for consistency with the observations. Assimilation of MODIS AOD changes the model's aerosol fields, altering the radiation, which has a small indirect impact on the meteorology.For independent model evaluation, AERONET Aerosol Robtic Network data are used as unassimilated measures of AOD. MODIS AODs were retrieved at 550 nm, but limited AERONET data were available at this wavelength. Therefore, the Angstrom exponent was used to interpolate AERONET AODs to 550 nm. At each site Figure  1 , the closest AERONET observation within 1 h to 12 UTC was sampled to compare with the model AOD. The assimilation of MODIS AODs improves the correlation between the model and AERONET data at all locations, reducing mean bias everywhere except Tamanrasset; see supporting information . To investigate haboobs, we use two independent proxies lightning and rainfall from the Lightning Imaging Sensor LIS and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission TRMM .Global model mean dust aerosol optical depth AOD at 550 nm at 12 UTC and the data assimilation increment DAI AOD, with 850 hPa winds overplotted. a and c The monsoon season May–September 2013 and b and d the nonmonsoon season October 2013 to April 2014 . e The seasonal cycle Hovmöller of the 3 day running mean DAI AOD, averaged longitudinally between 5°W to 15°E. Black crosses = lightning. Green 0.4 and pink 0.6 contours show model AOD. Purple line shows the monsoon front ITD, 2 m dew point = 14°C . Below are the daily absolute fractional DAI/model AOD and total DAIs over the subdomain 5°W–15°E, 5–25°N . Red = positive, blue = negative, and black = total absolute DAI.Figure  1 shows that there are widespread high AODs during the monsoon season Figure  1 a , with maxima between 0.5 and 0.7 over the Bodélé Depression marked with B and western Mauritania. Under nonmonsoon conditions Figure  1 b , the dust loading is generally lower, with Saharan AODs between 0.2 and 0.35, peaking again over the Bodélé Depression at 0.4. The 850 hPa winds show Harmattan wind-driven dust transport into the Sahel and out to the tropical Atlantic.In both monsoon and nonmonsoon seasons the DAIs show that the model overestimates AOD in the Sahara by around 0.05–0.25 blue in Figures  1 c and 1 d . This is on the order of 30% and therefore a significant error middle panel of Figure  1 e . During the monsoon season dust is underestimated over the Sahel, and over the North African coastline and Mediterranean Sea Figure  1 c , and this is seen to a lesser extent in the winter season Figure  1 d . The error over the sea is from transport or deposition since there is no local source. From Figure  1 alone it is not possible to tell whether errors over the Sahel are from emission, transport, or deposition.Figure  1 e shows the AOD maxima green and purple contours following the seasonal progression of the monsoon front the Intertropical Discontinuity, ITD; purple line as seen by Engelstaedter and Washington . The dust minimum occurs in September–November followed by a maximum in December–March, at 10–15°N, linked to dust emission from the Harmattan winds and the Bodélé Depression NLLJ. The subsequent JJA summertime maximum is linked with emission from NLLJ and haboobs, and early in this period, dust is uplifted from the dry Sahel land surface and high AODs extend south of the ITD.Between 20 and 25°N the model overestimates dust in all seasons as shown by the negative DAIs see also Figures  1 c and  1 d . In May–August, the northward progression of positive DAIs on either side of the ITD is potentially linked to missing haboob dust emission, caused by the parameterization of convection, which cannot produce the spatial separation of updraft and downdraft in sheared environments that ultimately lead to larger cold pools, organization, and longer lifetimes of convective systems. This is supported by the associated lightning crosses in Figure  1 e and is discussed in detail in section 3.3 . In this time of year and region, where soil moisture and vegetation cover change rapidly, errors in the land surface submodel could be important, too. In September-October-November SON , there is hardly any significant underprediction in the considered region at any latitude, but from December to April underprediction occurs again to the north of the ITD, where we expect the influence of Harmattan winds and NLLJs. Land surface errors may play a role here, as this marks the period of vegetation dieback in the Sahel.The model errors are relatively stable throughout the year with marked individual spikes, both for absolute values and for errors considered as a fraction of total AOD. As the model typically overestimates dust, the negative DAIs make up a larger proportion of the model AOD, especially in SON where the AOD is lower and errors are dominated by dust overestimation. The positive absolute DAIs fractional and total peak in May–August possibly related to missing haboob dust and January–March potentially linked to missing Harmattan dust, which would be consistent with other models that have too weak NLLJs and underestimate dust emission . The overall total absolute DAI peaks through December 2013 to March 2014 .In order to investigate the dependence of model errors on the meteorology, Figure  2 shows DAI composited for “high” >7 m/s and “low” <7 m/s 10 m model wind speed regimes 7 m/s is a typical threshold for emission . Results using 6, 8, or 9 m/s are similar not shown . Differences in DAI AOD seen in Figures  1 and 2 will arise from both model errors in the land surface and winds.The influence of wind regimes. Model DAI AOD composited under a and b high >7 m/s and c and d low <7 m/s model 10 m wind speeds minus the average DAI see Figures  1 c and 1 d during the monsoon season Figures  2 a and 2 c and the nonmonsoon season Figures  2 b and 2 d . Green contouring shows significant 95% differences from the seasonal average DAI using a bootstrapping method see supporting information .DAIs are normally negative over the Sahara i.e., dust is overpredicted, Figure  1 . Figures  2 a and 2 b show that in both seasons, this error increases in magnitude under strong winds blue ; i.e., the model emits more dust than the seasonal average dust overestimation. This is more pronounced in the nonmonsoon season with more significant pixels green lines—using a “Bootstrapping method”; see supporting information . In contrast, dust is underestimated over the Sahel in strong winds red , and again, this error is greater than that seen in the mean state. This error in the Sahel is largest in the nonmonsoon season, which could be related to the land surface model struggling to realistically treat the vegetation dieback during the dry season and its effect on roughness. Another factor could be underestimation of NLLJ speed. Generally, since dust emission is expected for many of the strong winds analyzed in Figure  2 , the similarities between Figures  2 a and 2 b and Figures  1 c and 1 d suggest that much of the mean errors seen in Figure  1 arise from errors in emissions.Under “low winds” <7 m/s , Figures  2 c and 2 d show that the model underestimates dust. This is most pronounced over the Sahara during the monsoon season. Together with the overestimation of dust in high winds, this could indicate that the balance between the wind-based and emission scaling tunings needs to be revisited to reduce the dust emission for high winds, but with a compensating increase emission at lower wind speeds. However, the overprediction in the Sahara decreases with increasing wind not shown , as models struggle to capture the highest winds and the highest AODs often come from haboobs that are missed by the model. There may also be an impact of a lower resolution DA system attempting to smooth out high AOD features associated with locally high winds.The underprediction at low winds is consistent with dust raised by processes known to be missing from the model, including cold pools generated by isolated and organized convective storms haboobs and subgrid-scale features such as dust devils. Overprediction of emission at modeled high wind speeds compensates to give a model mean AOD that is close to observed. The role of haboobs is demonstrated in section 3.3 . In addition, Figures  1 and 2 show how dust is overestimated from the Bodélé Depression represented by “B” in Figure  1 on average but underestimated during light winds. This may arise from an insufficient representation of the mountain channeling and NLLJ breakdown in these synoptic conditions or perhaps other mesoscale and BL processes. The skill of the UM wind speeds over the Sahara/Sahel is discussed in the supporting information .Haboob winds are known to be largely missing from the model due to the use of parameterized moist convection. Figure  3 shows composites of dust DAI AOD, using two different identifiers of the deep convection that generates haboobs.The influence of haboobs on model DAI AOD composited under a and b LIS lightning events and c and d significant TRMM rainfall minus the average DAI see Figures  1 c and 1 d during the monsoon season Figures  3 a and 3 c and the nonmonsoon season Figures  3 b and 3 d .Deep convection typically forms over Africa in the late afternoon with large organized systems persisting through the night and decaying the next day. For major storms the haboobs generated can span scales of several hundreds of kilometers. Figures  3 a and 3 b therefore show AOD DAIs composited for a radius of 2° around observed lightning flashes, using the 24 h of LIS flashes observed before the 12 UTC DAI. Similarly, Figures  3 c and 3 d use the 24 h of TRMM rainfall preceding the 12 UTC DAI, and composites using boxes of 3 by 3 pixels 75 by 75 km around rainfall events, which are defined as where the 24 h accumulated rain is >25% of the seasonal monsoon and nonmonsoon rainfall average for that location. For both TRMM and LIS, changing details of the methods alter small-scale details of the plots, but not the overall picture. Typically, the TRMM sample size is approximately 20–30% larger than that of LIS over the Sahel and Sahara.The composites in Figure  3 are noisy. However, using either method, in the monsoon season, there is a significant signal of underprediction of dust where haboobs are expected over the western part of the Sahara all the way north to the southern foothills of the Atlas chain Figures  3 a and 3 c , with evidence of signals in other regions such as northern Chad and Sudan. This is consistent with past studies showing evidence of summertime haboobs in these regions. The fractional positive DAIs Figure  1 e peak in May–June, when a dry atmosphere tends to give stronger haboob winds representing 10–30% of the model AOD. This potentially represents the haboob emission missed by the model, but some may be from other sources of error, and there may also be compensating errors. In contrast over the Mediterranean, there is a weak and not statistically significant overprediction of dust, which may be linked to wet deposition of suspended dust from midlatitude frontal precipitation.In the nonmonsoon season Figures  3 b and 3 d , when haboobs are less numerous, the signal is rarely significant. There is overprediction over the northern Sahara, where in this season cyclonic or frontal systems generate both rain and lightning and likely remove dust by wet deposition.We have developed a novel approach to understand sources of errors in dust forecasts from an NWP system, made possible by assimilation of satellite-derived AODs. Overall, the assimilation of MODIS AOD into the UK Met Office global model examined here improves comparisons between model dust AOD and AERONET AODs for the year studied. The 1 year analyzed already provides an illustration of the limitations of the model and the possibilities of this new approach. The assimilation shows that the model is underestimating dust emission in the Sahel and overestimating it over the Sahara throughout the year.The model overpredicts and underpredicts dust under strong >7 m/s and light <7 m/s model 10 m winds, respectively, relative to the seasonally average errors. This is consistent with mesoscale and BL processes, known to be missing in the model, uplifting dust in reality when modeled grid-scale winds are too low for uplift. Therefore, we hypothesize that the compensating, greater than observed dust at high model wind speeds results from the tuning of the model.Proxies for haboobs occurrence have been used to detect the underestimation of dust emission in the model resulting from parameterized convection and the associated inability to represent cold pool dust uplift. DAI composited under the haboob proxies shows model AOD underestimation over the western Sahara, especially in the monsoon season. We conservatively suggest that haboob dust emission, from the increase in DAI colocated with deep convection proxies, represents approximately 10–30% of the full dust loading over the Sahel/southern Sahara during the summer monsoon.This methodology of using DAIs to examine dust forecast errors is a powerful tool and provides insight in model limitations, which cannot be easily extracted from other sources of information. We propose that DAIs should be used more to characterize model errors and to gauge the success of model developments. Assimilation of AOD from Metasets Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager would allow for the assessment of the diurnal cycle dust errors."
2,dust ocean,"Responses of phytoplankton community to the input of different aerosols in the East China Sea. Atmospheric deposition can affect marine phytoplankton by supplying macronutrients and trace elements. We conducted mesocosm experiments by adding aerosols with different composition dominated by mineral dust, biomass burning and high Cu, and secondary aerosol, respectively to the surface seawater of the East China Sea. Chlorophyll a concentrations were found to be the highest and lowest after adding aerosols containing the highest Fe and dissolved inorganic nitrogen DIN , respectively. The relative abundance of Haptophyceae increased significantly after adding mineral dust, whereas diatom, Dinophyceae and Cryptophyceae reached the maximum accompanied with the highest DIN. Our results suggest that Fe may be more important than DIN in promoting primary productivity in the sampled seawater. The input of mineral dust and anthropogenic aerosols may result in distinct changes of phytoplankton community structure. Atmospheric deposition plays an important role in supplying nutrients and trace elements to marine ecosystems. These allogenic substances may affect primary productivity, phytoplankton community structure, and associated sea-air emissions of biogenic reactive gases containing sulfur, nitrogen, and halogen and therefore can influence global biogeochemical cycling, atmospheric chemistry, and climate change. It was found that mineral dust could increase primary productivity and nitrogen consumption in the laboratory experiment and the North Atlantic. Aerosols containing high concentration of Cu might have toxic effects on marine phytoplankton, and different phytoplankton clades showed divergent tolerance to Cu toxicity. Similarly, cyanobacteria responded differently to aerosols with different chemical composition, and phytoplankton with different sizes showed dissimilar responses to mineral dust and rainwater in the Yellow Sea. Phytoplankton in different areas of the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea also demonstrated different responses to the deposition of Sahara dust. Overall, the response of phytoplankton to atmospheric deposition is complex and influenced by many factors such as phytoplankton community structure and aerosol chemical composition.Molecular method is a powerful tool for studying phytoplankton ecology. This method can explore the microbial diversity through nucleotide sequencing and polymerase chain reaction PCR , which amplifies the barcode gene e.g., SSU rRNA or some functional genes in the microorganisms. The functional gene codes key enzymes in the biochemical processes, and its diversity may reflect the roles that microorganisms play in the biogeochemical cycles. The concentration of T3 during the incubation period 1.96 mg m −3 was the lowest among the three treatments, suggesting that phytoplankton growth should not be limited by the DIN and trace metals Fe and Cu could play more important roles in controlling the primary productivity in the sampled seawater.The ions DIN: dissolved inorganic nitrogen; AC: acetate and total elements from the added aerosols in different treatments T1, T2 and T3 of the mesocosm experiment.The change of total Chl a concentrations in the control and different treatments by adding aerosol 1, 2 and 3 during the incubation period 0, 24, 48 and 72 h .The importance of Fe deposition to the primary productivity has been demonstrated in the adjacent southern Yellow Sea during the severe dust episodes. Iron can stimulate the phytoplankton growth by accelerating photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient uptake within cells, whereas elevated free Cu 2+ may inhibit the growth by decreasing photosynthetic rates, interfering with the uptake of other essential trace metals and disrupting enzyme function. As dissolved Cu is typically complexed by strong organic ligands in seawater, free Cu 2+ concentrations are detected very low 0.1 pM to 0.1 nM in coastal waters. We have calculated free Cu 2+ concentration using Visual MINTEQ and found that it was 7–12 times lower than the input Cu in the artificial seawater pH 7.56 ~ 8.00 . Although organic complexation may increase the fractional solubility of Fe and avoid the scavenging of soluble Fe by particles in the ocean, this process will largely reduce the concentration of dissolved inorganic Fe labile Fe , which can be directly used by eukaryotic phytoplankton and seems to be more important in controlling the Chl a concentrations within 24 h in our experiment. Therefore, the large amount of secondary organic species in aerosol 3 may have complexed with Fe and Cu and reduced their bioavailability depends on free metal ions , which may well explain the lowest value of maximal Chl a observed enhanced by Fe and the relatively higher Chl a in T3 than T2 after 24 h incubation inhibited by Cu . Phytoplankton was suggested to respond quickly within 24 h to the diel change of trace metal concentrations and to the input of aerosol components. The extended period of exposure to toxicants may allow the phytoplankton population to adapt to high Cu levels, and thus, similar concentrations of Chl a were observed among the treatments and the control after 72 h incubation.Phytoplankton community structure was analyzed using the rbc L gene, and a total of 658 clones were obtained with average 65 clones for each sample. The clones derived from Form IAB showed high library coverages average 95% and low diversity indexes abundance-based coverage estimators ACE , Chao 1 and Shannon , whereas Form ID demonstrated relatively lower coverages average 73% and accordingly higher diversity Table S2 , suggesting that the method could capture Form IAB groups more effectively at the relatively low taxonomic level. When comparing the control between 0 and 72 h time points, Chao 1 and ACE values decreased along with the increase of Chl a concentration and Shannon index Table S2 , implying the reduction of phytoplankton richness and the increased uniformity of proportions of various taxa after the incubation. Unlike Chl a concentrations, different Chao 1 and ACE values were also found between the control and treatments after 72 h incubation, suggesting that phytoplankton community structure might change in response to the input of atmospheric aerosols.Mamiellophyceae-like sequences were found to be the dominant class of Form IAB occupying on average 95% of the total clones Figure S3 . This group increased approximately 6% after 72 h incubation in the control. Bathycoccus prasinos - and Micromonas sp.-like sequences were the two most dominant taxa of Form IAB, which belonged to the class Mamiellophyceae and together accounted for about 70%–79% of the total clones Table S3 . An increase in the proportion of B. prasinos but the decline of Micromonas sp. was found in the control after 72 h incubation, suggesting that the growth of B. prasinos was more enhanced relative to Micromonas sp. during the incubation. Bathycoccus and Micromonas both are eukaryotic picoplankton distributed widely in world's oceans including the Arctic area. Bathycoccus was found to be abundant in oligotrophic stations of the Mediterranean Sea and the Sargasso Sea, whereas Micromonas sp. was almost absent in the central Mediterranean Sea. The increased proportion of B. prasinos -like sequences during the incubation was probably associated with the consumption of nutrients within the closed mesocosm system. Nonetheless, the growth advantage of B. prasinos seemed to be hindered to various degrees by adding different aerosol samples nutrients supply . Specifically, the relatively abundances of B. prasinos and Micromonas sp. were found to be significantly lower 40% difference and higher 30% difference in T3 than in the control after 72 h incubation, respectively Table S3 . Aerosol 3 treatment contained the highest concentrations of DIN 724 µg L −1 and was the most eutrophic among all treatments and control, which might be conducive to Micromonas sp. growth but unfavorable for B. prasinos .The relative abundance of clones similar to Euglenophyceae was found to be the highest in T3 3% of the total clones; Figure S3 , consistent with the preference of this clade to eutrophic waters. Cyanobacteria, prokaryotic phytoplankton distributed ubiquitously in low-latitude waters, accounted for remarkably low proportion <1% of the total Form IAB clones in all samples analyzed. This group includes some important diazotrophic genera, and its low proportions may agree well with the relatively high nutrient concentrations average 7.3 µmol L −1 of DIN and slicate in the sampled seawater. PCR is an important process in the molecular ecological method, and this process would underrate the low-abundance DNA fragments due to its reaction mechanism. In addition, the copy number of some genes can be much higher for eukaryotic phytoplankton than prokaryotes due to the bigger genome. The low abundant Cyanobacteria and the high abundant groups e.g., Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, or Haptophyceae may be underrated and overrated respectively due to the bias of this method. However, results about the change of relative abundance would not affected.Haptophyceae and Coscinodiscophyceae were the two most dominant classes of Form ID together accounting for about 67%–89% of the total clones. The relative abundance of Haptophyceae-like sequences declined about 13% after 72 h incubation in the control Figure S3 , which is probably related to the depletion of nutrient elements during the incubation. This group was found to be much more abundant 65% relative to diatoms 31% in T1, which was different from the control and other two treatments, suggesting that the input of aerosol 1 with the highest concentrations of crustal elements such as Fe and Ca may especially benefit the growth of Haptophyceae. Two orders of Haptophyceae, Prymnesiales 31% , and Coccolithales 7% both showed substantially increase in their proportions in T1 Figure 3 , and Chrysochromulina alifera belonging to the order Prymnesiales accounts for approximately 30.5% of the total clones in T1 Table S3 .The relative abundances of dominant phytoplankton groups in the control and treatments T1, T2 and T3 after 72 h incubation.Prymnesiales is one of major groups producing dimethylsulfoniopropionate, which is the precursor of dimethylsulfide DMS . Dimethylsulfide is an important component in the global sulfur cycle and occupies over 50% of the total natural sulfur emission. The oxidation products of DMS can influence atmospheric acidity, cloud formation, and the Earth's surface temperature. Coccolithales can synthesize calcium carbonate shell by consuming bicarbonate and calcium and releasing carbon dioxide in seawater equation 1 , and therefore plays a critical role in the “biological carbon pump” and in regulating the ocean acidity. The remarkable increase in the proportion of this clade in T1 is very likely due to the highest concentration of Ca associated with the input of mineral dust aerosol 1; Figure 2 . Similarly, the bloom of Coccolithales was found to occur frequently in the Mediterranean Sea and it might be due to the impact of African Dust. Conscinodiscophyceae was dominant in diatoms, and its relative abundance was slightly lower in T1 24% of the total clones but significantly higher in T2 43% and T3 47% compared to the control 27%: Figure 3 . Thalassiosira sp. belonging to the class Conscinodiscophyceae was found to be the most abundant OTU in T2 and T3 43% and 44% of the total clones; Table S3 . Bacillariophyceae, another class of diatoms, increased remarkably in T3 9% of the total clones; Figure 3 , and Dinophyceae and Cryptophyceae both reached the highest proportions 5% and 10%, respectively in T3 Figure S3 . Aerosol 3 treatment contains the highest concentration of DIN 724 µg L −1 , which was at least threefold higher than those of T1 and T2. In the view of the relative abundance of Form ID clones, the diatom prefers high nutrients. Specifically, Thalassiosira spp. was found to be the dominant taxa in diatom blooms in the East China Sea. The dominance of diatoms in T3 suggested that the polluting aerosols with high concentration of secondary species might benefit the diatom growth in the East China Sea.The mesocosm experiment was done in the last month of spring on 12–16 May . In spring, the existence of a large-scale dry zone over midlatitudes of Asia provides a favorable environment for the frequent occurrences of dust events and subsequent dust transport across Asia. The dust impact on the ECS shall be the largest in this season. Moreover, phytoplankton biomass in the coastal ECS demonstrates a bimodal pattern with the maximum in August and a subpeak in May. Although phytoplankton growth can be affected by many factors such as temperature, radiation, hydrodynamic conditions, and predator-prey relationships, the high primary production may also be linked to dust deposition in the ECS. Additionally, Yangtze River runoff peaks in summer and its impact on the surface seawater of our study site is relatively small in May. Overall, May seems to be a good month for doing the mesocosm experiment and our results may be proximal to the actual situation.Meteorological data can be obtained from the nearest Shengsi station an island ~20 km to Huaniao . The average air temperatures over the study site are 14, 26, 19, and 5.9°C for spring, summer, autumn, and winter respectively, with an annual average around 16°C. Relative humidity and precipitation are found to be lower in winter and autumn and higher in spring and summer with annual averages of 74% and 920 mm, respectively. The prevailing winds switch from the south mainly in summer to the north winter as influenced by East Asian Monsoon, which may significantly affect the transport of terrigenous substances to the ECS. Our mesocosm experiment was done under usual meteorological conditions of the May with average temperature 19°C and relative humidity 77% south wind mixes with northwest wind with the speeds 3.4–8.5 m/s . The experimental temperature is comparable to that on 27 October 21°C, aerosol 2 collected but significantly higher than those on 31 March 11°C, aerosol 1 collected and 16 January 4.4°C, aerosol 3 collected . Higher temperature may enhance phytoplankton growth, and the actual Chl a increment induced by aerosol 1 deposition in March may be less than the experimental result. Besides, the lower temperature of March may be adverse to the phytoplankton groups which prefer warm water. Although different sampling dates of aerosols may lead to phytoplankton response in actual ocean different from the experimental results, the observed impact of different aerosols on phytoplankton community are valuable.Atmospheric deposition can affect marine phytoplankton diversity by supplying nutrients and toxicants, and the input of different aerosols may result in distinct change of phytoplankton community structure. By applying mesocosm experiments and the rbc L genetic marker, we investigated the responses of phytoplankton community to three aerosol samples dominated respectively by mineral dust, biomass burning and high Cu, and secondary aerosol in the ECS. It is found that atmospheric deposition of Fe and Cu may play more important roles than DIN in controlling the primary productivity in the sampled seawater, which is probably due to the eutrophic condition and sufficient DIN in the coastal ECS. Although Chl a concentrations were similar among all treatments and the control after 72 h incubation, phytoplankton community structure changed remarkably. Mineral dust significantly increased the relative abundance of Bathycoccus Chlorophyta in Form IAB groups and Haptophyceae in Form ID groups, whereas secondary aerosol with the highest DIN enhanced the growth of diatoms. Specifically, the deposition of mineral dust may strongly affect global sulfur cycle and biological carbon pump by enhancing the dominance of Prymnesiales and Coccolithales belonging to Haptophyceae. The impact of mineral dust on ocean biogeochemical cycles should be further studied."
3,climate aerosol,"Aerosol data assimilation using data from Himawari-8, a next-generation geostationary meteorological satellite. Himawari-8, a next-generation geostationary meteorological satellite, was launched on 7 October 2014 and became operational on 7 July 2015. The advanced imager on board Himawari-8 is equipped with 16 observational bands including three visible and three near-infrared bands that enable retrieval of full-disk aerosol optical properties at 10min intervals from geostationary GEO orbit. Here we show the first application of aerosol optical properties AOPs derived from Himawari-8 data to aerosol data assimilation. Validation of the assimilation experiment by comparison with independent observations demonstrated successful modeling of continental pollution that was not predicted by simulation without assimilation and reduced overestimates of dust front concentrations. These promising results suggest that AOPs derived from Himawari-8/9 and other planned GEO satellites will considerably improve forecasts of air quality, inverse modeling of emissions, and aerosol reanalysis through assimilation techniques. On 7 October 2014, the Japan Meteorological Agency launched Himawari-8, the eighth Japanese geostationary meteorological satellite GMS ; the satellite became operational on 7 July 2015. Himawari-8 and the yet to be launched Himawari-9 are equipped with more advanced multispectral imagers Advanced Himawari Imager; AHI ahead of other planned GMSs. The AHI has 16 observation bands from visible to infrared with high spatial 0.5–1.0 km visible and 1–2 km for infrared and temporal six full-disk images per hour resolution and provides about 50 times more data than previous GMSs. It is an attractive characteristic for aerosol research that the AHI includes observational bands in visible and near-infrared wavelengths sensitive to aerosol scattering and absorption. This characteristic allows the AHI data to provide full-disk images of aerosol optical properties AOPs , including aerosol optical thickness AOT and Ångström exponent AE , at 10 min intervals over wide areas of the globe East and Southeast Asia, the western Pacific Ocean, Oceania, and the Australian continent .The start of the operational phase of Himawari-8 was an important first step in the advance of global monitoring of aerosols. In October 2016, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Aeronautics and Space Administration plan to launch the first of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R GOES-R series, which will be equipped with an Advanced Baseline Imager with comparable capabilities to those of the AHI. There are other plans to launch geostationary satellites to observe atmospheric composition e.g., geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite; Tropospheric Emissions, Monitoring of POllution; and sentinel-4 , which will allow continuous monitoring of the spatial distribution of aerosols around the globe.In recent years, AOPs from low Earth orbit LEO satellites have had an important role in improving aerosol data assimilation and forecasting, in inverse modeling of emissions, and in the production of reanalysis data sets. However, owing to the orbital periods and swath widths of LEOs, AOPs derived from them have limited spatial coverage and observation frequencies. AOPs derived from geostationary satellites can overcome these limitations. ; the Himawari-8 AOPs are available at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency JAXA Himawari Monitor website http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ptree/index.html .In this study, the original Himawari-8 AOTs at 500 nm were extrapolated to AOTs at 550 nm using AE, regridded to the model grid, and then used in data assimilation. We estimated observation errors to be the retrieval uncertainty attached to the Himawari-8 AOP data plus a standard deviation calculated as the representative error in the regridding. The retrieval uncertainty ranged from 0.0001 to 1.04 with average of 0.013 and has larger values in the land relative to over the ocean.Observations from LEO satellites and from ground observation sites were used for independent validation of our simulations. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS AOT data correspond to the “optical depth land and ocean mean” provided by Collection 5.1, L2 aerosol data from the Terra, and Aqua LEO satellites. The overpass times of Terra 1030 local time LT and Aqua 1330 LT correspond to about 0130 UTC and 0430 UTC at 135°E, respectively.To allow comparison of simulation results from LEO and Himawari-8 data, the MODIS AOTs were regridded to the resolution of our model. The Asian Dust Network AD-Net distributes Mie lidar data over East Asia and provides vertical profiles of extinction coefficients and depolarization ratios. We used AD-Net vertical profiles of extinction coefficient at 532 nm at five Japanese sites. The Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET; http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov / provides AOPs measured by sun photometers. We used an AOT at 550 nm derived from linear interpolation of AERONET AOT measured at 500 and 675 nm of Level 1.5 for our validation. We used the AERONET AOTs at two South Korean sites Baengnyeong and Gosan, Seoul National University and two Japanese sites Fukuoka and Shirahama . Sky radiometers deployed by SKYNET http://atmos2.cr.chiba-u.jp/skynet/ provide AOP measurements. We used AOT measured by SKYNET at two Japanese sites Chiba and Saga for validation of our experiments. Statistical metrics used in the validation are described in Text S1 in the supporting information.A snapshot of AOT derived from Himawari-8 observations at 0700 UTC on 15 April Figure  1 a shows anthropogenic air pollution from continental areas extending over the Korean Peninsula and western Japan. AOTs derived from MODIS data were consistent with the spatial distribution and magnitude of the Himawari-8 AOTs Figures  1 b and 1 c . The RF simulation Figure  1 d failed to reproduce the pollution, whereas the DA simulation successfully reproduced the pollution observed over western Japan Figure  1 e but showed a little modification in the pollution around the Korean Peninsula. This indicates that no ensemble of the ensemble could capture the pollution around the Korean Peninsula, indicating a need to improve model transport processes, anthropogenic emissions, and ensemble generation. The RF simulation modeled a large dust storm over Inner Mongolia and central-east China Figure  1 d that was considerably overestimated according to the satellite observations. The DA simulation reduced the degree of overestimation.Horizontal distributions of AOT derived from Himawari-8 data and modeled AOT at 0700 UTC on 15 April 2015 and 0200 UTC on 16 April 2015. a and f AOT derived from Himawari-8 data, b and g AOT derived from MODIS/Terra, c and h AOT derived from MODIS/Aqua, d and i modeled AOT by RF simulation, and e and j modeled AOT by DA simulation. Red circles indicate AD-Net lidar sites. Black areas are areas of no data due to clouds and snow cover.On 16 April, AOT derived from Himawari-8 data showed that the anthropogenic pollutant of the previous day had moved eastward and was over central Japan and the western north Pacific and that there was evidence of a dust front in the Yellow Sea Figure  1 f . These phenomena were also apparent in the MODIS AOTs Figures  1 g and 1 h . In contrast, the RF simulation Figure  1 i predicted much cleaner air over central Japan and the western Pacific. Furthermore, the southwestern part of the dust front 27–38°N and 110–130°E was overestimated compared to the AOT derived from Himawari-8 data. Data assimilation corrected these errors and provided simulation results that were closer to observations Figure  1 j .Scatter diagrams of AOT derived from Himawari-8 data versus modeled AOT are shown in Figure S2 in the supporting information. Statistical metrics are listed in Table S1 in the supporting information. In general, the RF simulation provided underestimates in regions where AOT derived from Himawari-8 data was greater than 0.2. These underestimates were also reflected in negative normalized mean bias values Table S1 . A plausible explanation for the underestimates is the poor reproducibility of the anthropogenic pollution shown in Figure  1 . The DA simulation reduced the underestimation and showed much better agreement with AOT derived from Himawari-8 data. However, on 15 April there were some underestimates in the DA simulation Figure  2 b ; these might be attributable to a lack of improvement of the modeling of the pollution around the Korean Peninsula Figure  1 c . Assimilation provided improvements in all statistical metrics. Root-mean-square errors RMSE and normalized mean errors NME were reduced by 21.7–36.6%. The DA_LEO simulation generally brought positive effects especially on 15 April , but the improvement was limited, particularly for the underestimate of the anthropogenic pollution. The snap shots by satellites sometimes failed to capture the main parts of the pollutions due to cloud covers see Figure  1 . Hourly Himawari-8 AOT could provide more opportunities to obtain the information about the pollutions, because clouds at the upper air might be transported faster than the pollutions in the boundary layer. In the assimilation procedure equation 1 , analysis value is obtained by a linear combination of modeled and observed values weighted by the background and observation errors. So more observations bring the analysis value closer to the observed value. This indicates that the hourly Himawari-8 AOTs used in the DA simulation yields larger sample number for the pollution and leads to the apparent reduction of the observation error comparing with the Himawari-8 AOTs twice a day used in the DA_LEO simulation. These are plausible reasons that the DA simulation produced superior results to the DA_LEO simulation.Scatter diagrams of AOT on 15, 16, and 17 April 2015 comparing observed values derived from MODIS with modeled result: a, d, and g the RF simulation, b, e, and h the DA simulation, and b, e, and h the DA_LEO simulation. Red and green dots denote MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua, respectively. Solid black solid line is 1:1 line. Data between 122–150°E and 20–46°N were used.We also produced scatter diagrams and calculated statistical metrics for the AOTs derived from MODIS data Figure  2 and Table S2 in supporting information . These scatter diagrams showed similar distributions to those for the AOTs derived from Himawari-8 data. Higher modeled AOT in the RF simulation on 15 April corresponds to overestimated dust and carbonaceous aerosols in northeastern China see Figure  1 e . Almost all of the statistical metrics for the DA simulation were better than those of the RF simulation, but a positive bias seems to manifest in assimilations for 16 and 17 April see normalized mean bias values in Table S2 , which suggests that there is bias between AOTs derived from Himawari-8 and MODIS data. The DA simulation reduced both the RMSE and NME by 2.2–29.6% compared to the AOT derived from MODIS data except for MODIS/Aqua data for 16 April. The DA_LEO simulation also showed better agreements, but improvement was less than that by the DA simulation.Figure  3 shows time-height cross sections of observed and simulated extinction coefficients at Fukuejima, Nagasaki, and Niigata similar cross sections at Matsue and Chiba are provided in Figure S3 in the supporting information . Lidar measurements captured layers of spherical nondust aerosol particles i.e., anthropogenic pollution on 15 April in western Japan Fukuejima and Nagasaki and on 16 April in central Japan Niigata . These observations are consistent with the AOT derived from Himawari-8 data Figures  1 a and 1 f . The RF simulation successfully reproduced the distribution of this pollution but considerably underestimated its density. Similar underestimates were evident in comparisons of RF simulated data with AOT derived from Himawari-8 data Figure  1 . Data assimilation reduced the underestimation and provided better agreement with lidar data. However, the failure of both the RF and DA simulations to capture a layer of pollution observed at 3000 m altitude is attributed mostly to the vertical resolution of the model at around 3000 m altitude 400–600 m , which is too coarse to reproduce a layer of pollution layer of ~1000 m thickness. Moreover, data assimilation had little effect on modeling at the elevation of that layer. Lack of information about the vertical profile in the data assimilation might also have contributed to the failure to identify this layer. Depolarization ratios not shown indicated that dust particles were dominant in an aerosol layer detected on 17 April. For that layer, the DA simulations provided better agreement with lidar data than the RF simulations, especially for sites in central Japan i.e., Niigata and Matsue .Time-height plots of extinction coefficients at Fukuejima, Nagasaki, and Niigata. a, d, and g AD-Net lidar observations, b, e, and h modeled results without data assimilation, and c, f, and i modeled results with data assimilation locations shown in Figure  1 a . Model results were interpolated to 30 m vertical resolution. Black areas in observed data are areas of missing data due to clouds and rain.Figure  4 shows comparisons of RF, DA, and DA_LEO simulation results with AOTs from AERONET and SKYNET. Time series of Himawari-8 AOT at 10 min intervals are also shown in Figure  4 . Himawari-8 AOTs were in good agreement with AOTs measured by AERONET, SKYNET, and MODIS. It is worth noting that Himawari-8 can capture temporal evaluations of AOT like AERONET and SKYNET. The anthropogenic pollution detected in Himawari-8 and MODIS data on 15 April see Figures  1 a– 1 c was also detected by AERONET at South Korean stations Baengnyeong Figure  4 a and Gosan_SNU Figure  4 b . Although the RF simulation at Gosan_SNU failed to reproduce that pollution on 15 April, the DA simulation did, albeit with a much lower AOT than was observed. In the region of the Korean Peninsula, the dust front Figure  1 f that passed on 16 April was captured by observations at Gosan_SNU. The DA simulation at Gosan provided a lower dust concentration in the front than did the RF simulation, thus demonstrating better reproduction of observed data. The DA_LEO simulation showed similar time series to the RF simulation.Time series of observed and modeled AOT at AERONET sites Baengnyeong, Gosan, Fukuoka, and Shirahama and SKYNET sites Saga and Chiba . AOT values measured by satellites are also plotted. Site locations are shown in Figure  1 .The anthropogenic pollution of 15 April was evident in AERONET and SKYNET data for western Japan Saga and Fukuoka; Figures  4 c and 4 d and was consistent with its distribution according to satellite and lidar observations. The RF simulation considerably underestimated that pollution, but the DA simulation produced an AOT that agreed better with observed data. The DA_LEO simulation increased AOT but still underestimated significantly comparing with the observed value. Although simulations produced dense AOT events at Saga and Fukuoka on 16 April, observed data failed to capture the event because of a lack of nighttime observations. This anthropogenic pollution was transported eastward and detected at Shirahama central Japan on 16 April Figure  4 e . The DA simulation almost tripled the peak concentration of the pollution modeled without assimilation and agreed well with observations. The DA_LEO simulation showed similar time series to the observation and failed to improve the reproducibility of the peak. At Chiba Figure  4 f , the DA simulation showed AOT increasing on the morning of 17 April in response to a dust storm Figure  3 g , but clouds and rain prevented SKYNET observations at that time. At all four Japanese sites, data assimilation considerably improved the modeled peaks of anthropogenic pollution. However, the DA simulation still underestimated peak AOT levels, likely because of its inability to reproduce the pollution layer at 3000 m elevation.We applied data assimilation hourly to data acquired by Himawari-8, a next-generation geostationary meteorological satellite, from 14 to 18 April 2015 over East Asia to assess its impact on modeling of transboundary anthropogenic pollution and dust storms in the region.Data assimilation with hourly snap shots of Himawari-8 AOT data had a positive effect on the simulation. Modeling with data assimilation reproduced observed transboundary pollution that was not captured without data assimilation and reduced overestimations of concentrations at the dust front. Validation of the simulation results by comparison with independent satellite and ground-based measurements MODIS, AERONET, SKYNET, and AD-Net confirmed the benefits of data assimilation. However, there are limitations to the modeling that we attributed to errors in the model, the uncertainties in emissions, the coarseness of the model resolution, and the lack of vertical profile data for the assimilation. Further refinement of the model and inclusion of data on the vertical profile of aerosols in the assimilation will bring further benefits. We also performed an additional experiment in which Himawari-8 AOT was assimilated twice a day imitating LEO samples. The results of the additional assimilation showed improvement of limited magnitude comparing to those of the assimilation with hourly data. This indicates that the high-frequency observation achieved by Himawarai-8 could extend more opportunities to capture pollutions during transport and provide more information for data assimilation comparing with conventional LEO observations.The results presented here are promising for future simulations of both anthropogenic air pollution and natural dust outflow. However, data assimilation with AOPs derived from geostationary satellites is still in the development stage. Future studies should include comparison of data assimilations using AOPs derived from Himawari-8 data versus those derived from LEO satellite data, testing of data assimilation with spatially and temporally composited AOPs derived from Himawari-8 data M. Kikuchi et al., submitted manuscript , and evaluation of the possible benefits of data assimilation for operational forecasting systems."
4,dust aerosol,"Importance of coarse-mode nitrate produced via sea salt as atmospheric input to East Asian oceans. The atmospheric input of anthropogenic total reactive oxygenated nitrogen NOy to ocean regions in East Asia during 2002-2004 was revisited with an updated regional chemical transport model and the latest emissions inventory. The updated model treats both fine- and coarse-mode nitrate NO3- . Coarse-mode NO3- is produced by the reaction of nitric acid HNO3 and sea salt particles. The modeling system reproduced the atmospheric concentration and wet deposition amount of NO3- quantitatively compared with observations. The fraction of coarse-mode NO3- was also well captured. NOy deposition amounts over marginal seas and open oceans were 733 and 730 Gg N/yr, which are increases of 1.6- and 2.2-fold, respectively, by including coarse-mode NO3-. Anthropogenic NOx emissions from China were 5377 Gg N/yr, and 3060 Gg N/yr was exported from China; therefore, the NOy deposition amount over ocean regions in East Asia 1463 Gg N/yr corresponded to almost half 48% of the export amounts. Nutrient supply to the ocean surface layer is an important factor controlling the ocean ecosystem. The major paths for supplying nutrients are thought to be those from upwelling and river discharge, which is mostly taken up near the estuary region. However, the nutrients transported through the atmosphere into oceans have also become important owing to the acceleration of industrialization, particularly over Asia, India, North and South America, Europe, and West Africa. The impact of such nutrients on ocean ecosystems will be a particular concern in Asia, where anthropogenic emissions have surpassed those in North America and Europe in the mid-1990s. China is one of the most closely monitored countries, where nitrogen oxide NO x emissions have increased threefold from 1980 to 2000 and are continuing to increase. NO x from the industrial, power plant, transportation, domestic, and other sectors, produce nitric acid HNO 3 , aerosol nitrate NO 3 − , and many other nitrogen compounds through complex photochemistry.Chen and Wang estimated the atmospheric nitrate influx to the East China Sea ECS as more than 30% of the influx from river discharge based on budget analyses. Nakamura et al . reported the annual atmospheric influx of nitrate to the ECS, corresponding to 60% of the river discharge from the Yangtze River based on onboard observations during the research vessel R/V Hakuho Maru cruises. Zhang and Lui also reported the importance of the atmospheric supply of nitrate to the Yellow Sea YS ; this may be equal to or more important than riverine input. Onitsuka et al . examined the effect of atmospheric nitrogen inputs on primary production in the Sea of Japan SJ by using a coupled physical-ecosystem model and showed the effect of nitrogen deposition on primary production. These studies highlighted the importance of atmospheric inputs into marginal seas in East Asia.In our previous study, the total nitrate NO 3 − and HNO 3 depositions over marginal seas were estimated by the regional chemical transport model of the Community Multi-scale Air Quality CMAQ . A limitation was the exact treatment of coarse-mode NO 3 − produced from sea salt and/or mineral dust. Another report using the global chemical transport model found that including the reaction of HNO 3 with sea salt affects the nitrate burden. Recently, the interactions of HNO 3 with sea salt to produce coarse-mode NO 3 − have been introduced into the CMAQ model. This parameterization has been verified over three coastal sites near Tampa Bay, Florida, USA, revealing the improvement in the prediction of NO 3 − concentration. However, application and evaluation in East Asia is limited. The increase in NO x emissions in East Asia will supply substantial amounts of nitrogen to the atmosphere, and it will also cause variations in deposition. From the perspective of precipitation chemistry, we have shown that anthropogenic emissions from China were responsible for the variation in wet deposition over East Asia. Therefore, the behavior of nitrogen compounds based on the exact treatment of coarse-mode NO 3 − and its role as atmospheric input to oceans via deposition should be investigated with a focus on East Asia. Here we revisit our previous study. Among the reactive nitrogen Nr , we do not discuss ammonium nitrogen NH x , as we instead focus on the behavior of coarse-mode NO 3 − by introducing the reaction with sea salt particles. NO 3 − , HNO 3 , and other products, namely, NO, NO 2 , NO 3 , HNO 2 , N 2 O 5 , and peroxyacetyl nitrate PAN are analyzed. These targets are collectively referred to as NO y .The three-dimensional regional chemical transport model of CMAQ version 4.7.1 was used in this study. Applications of the CMAQ model associated with nitrogen compounds have been reported by Itahashi et al .. Itahashi et al . compared the simulated and multisatellite-observed NO 2 column, and Itahashi et al . analyzed the wet deposition of NO 3 − . These studies demonstrated that the modeling system captured the observed features of associated nitrogen compounds. The model domain is configured with an 80 km horizontal resolution covering all of East Asia, with 37 nonuniform vertical layers up to 50 hPa. The period analyzed in the present study is 2002–2004, that same as investigated by Uno et al .. Anthropogenic emissions are taken from the latest Regional Emission inventory in ASia REAS version 2.1, and the estimated uncertainty of total NO x emissions in China is ±37%. NO x emissions are well correlated with NO 2 column density, and evaluation with spaceborne observations partly supports the reliability of the inventory. Soil NO x data are taken from REAS version 2.1, and NO x emissions from biomass burning are obtained from the Global Fire Emissions Database version 3.1. The Statewide Air Pollution Research Center 99 and the 5th generation CMAQ aerosol module AERO5 are used to calculate gas and aerosol chemistry, respectively. In AERO5, the treatment of the dynamic transfer of HNO 3 , H 2 SO 4 , HCl, and NH 3 between coarse particles and the gas phase, which enables the simulation of coarse-mode NO 3 − , is included by evaluating SO 4 2- , NH 4 + , NO 3 − , Na + , and Cl - performance. The lateral boundary condition is obtained from the global CHASER model, which evaluated the NO y component. Sensitivity analysis performed without considering the NO y component showed that the effect of the boundary condition to NO y deposition over oceans in East Asia is approximately 10%.Spatial allocations of analyzed regions are presented in Figure  1 a. We focus on the marginal seas of the YS, ECS, SJ, the Tsushima Straits TS , and on the open oceans of the North Pacific NP and West-North Pacific WNP . The figure also shows two R/V Hakuho Maru tracks, the ground-based observation sites of the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia EANET , and Fukue observation supersite. We used monthly mean EANET observation data during 2002–2004 http://www.eanet.asia/product/index.html to evaluate the modeling reproducibility. In addition, we also used two R/V Hakuho Maru and the Fukue supersite observation data sets to verify the modeling reproducibility for size-resolved NO 3 − . Such observations are needed to provide further insight into the behavior of fine- and coarse-mode NO 3 − . The R/V Hakuho Maru provided the intense observations for September to October 2002 KH-02-3 and March 2004 KH-04-9 , and observation data at Fukue supersite were taken daily before 10 May 2002 or every 3 days after 11 May 2002 samples during the entire year of 2002. A detailed description of the observations is provided in Text S1 in the supporting information. a Design of investigation areas over marginal seas Yellow Sea, YS; East China Sea, ECS; Tsushima Strait, TS; and Sea of Japan, SJ and open oceans North Pacific, NP, and West-North Pacific, WNP in East Asia. Gray circles indicate ground-based observation stations in EANET, and white circle indicates the observation supersite at Fukue. Red and blue lines are the R/V Hakuho Maru tracks KH-02-3 and KH-04-9 . b Scatterplot of observation and model results for i atmospheric concentration of NO 3 − closed circles and HNO 3 open circles , and ii wet deposition of NO 3 − closed circles . The circle colors correspond to the investigation areas in Figure  1 a, and black circles indicate comparison at the Fukue supersite. The 1:1, 1:2, and 1:5 reference lines are shown, and statistical analyses are shown in the inset.Although Uematsu et al . discussed the importance of atmospheric supply of mineral dust, the current modeling system does not include the dust schemes; hence, the coarse-mode NO 3 − produced via the reaction of HNO 3 with dust is also not treated. In East Asia, the dust event from the Gobi Desert and Taklimakan Desert is well reported especially in spring. Water soluble organic nitrogen WSON has been identified as important deposited species relevant to NO y deposition, and it has been suggested that WSON is the major nitrogen species during dust events at Xi'an in inland China. Because mineral dust is not considered in our modeling system, WSON is not discussed here.The model results are compared with ground-based EANET observations for atmospheric concentrations of NO 3 − and HNO 3 , and wet deposition of NO 3 − in Figure  1 b. Note that the EANET observations provide the sum of fine- and coarse-mode NO 3 − . Correlation coefficients between the model and observations were around 0.49 to 0.58 and the skill scores, which account for the correlation and standard deviations of the two data sets, ranged from 0.56 to 0.79. The modeled monthly mean atmospheric concentrations of NO 3 − and HNO 3 , and the wet deposition of NO 3 − matched 42–68% of the observations within a factor of 2 and 67–88% of the observations within a factor of 3. Our modeling system can generally capture the atmospheric concentration and wet deposition of NO 3 − as well as our previous studies related to nitrogen compounds. The effect of dust on modeling reproducibility is discussed in Text S2 .The fraction of fine- and coarse-mode in NO 3 − should also be evaluated. These size-resolved data were available from the two R/V Hakuho Maru and the Fukue supersite observations. The atmospheric concentrations of NO 3 − and coarse-mode ratio in NO 3 − , defined as the ratio of coarse-mode NO 3 − to the sum of fine- and coarse-mode NO 3 − , are presented in Figure  2 . The atmospheric concentration of NO 3 − has winter maxima around 2 µg/m 3 and summer minima around 1 µg/m 3 , with a coarse-mode ratio of 60–80% in winter and of around 80% in summer Figure  2 a . Seasonal variations in the spatial distribution are presented in Text S3 . Overall, the modeling system can reproduce both the atmospheric concentration of NO 3 − and the coarse-mode ratio in NO 3 − . The modeling system slightly overestimated the atmospheric concentration of NO 3 − in March and April 2002, at the Fukue supersite, and had difficulty capturing the coarse-mode ratio in NO 3 − in April 2002 at the Fukue supersite and in March 2004 on the R/V Hakuho Maru KH-04-9 . During these periods, dust events were often observed, and these days were eliminated from the period averaged calculations. However, it is difficult to separate the dust effect, and the uncertainties caused by the mineral dust may need to be considered. The effect of dust on the observations is discussed at the end of section 3 .Modeled a atmospheric concentration of NO 3 − µg/m 3 and b coarse-mode ratio of NO 3 − % defined as the ratio of coarse-mode NO 3 − concentration to the sum of fine-mode NO 3 − and coarse-mode NO 3 − concentrations compared with observation data of R/V Hakuho Maru Figures  2 a left and 2 b left and Fukue supersite Figures  2 b right and 2 b right . Closed circles are model and open circles are observations from R/V Hakuho Maru obtained in September and October 2002 for KH-02-3 and in March 2004 for KH-04-9 see tracks in Figure  1 , whiskers indicate the standard deviation during the observation period. Thick black lines are model data, open circles are observation data from the Fukue supersite taken in 2002, shaded areas indicate the standard deviation of the model, and whiskers indicate the standard deviation of daily/3 day sampling during the month for observations.The seasonal variation of the atmospheric concentration and wet deposition of NO 3 − in each region is presented in Figure  3 . The summer minima and winter maxima of atmospheric NO 3 − concentrations over East Asian oceans were shown. The coarse-mode ratio in NO 3 − exhibited summer maxima in marginal seas, which were also observed at the Fukue supersite Figure  2 b , although the coarse-mode ratio in NO 3 − was continuously high near 100% in open oceans. These results indicate the important role of coarse-mode NO 3 − , particularly in the open oceans. The atmospheric NO 3 − concentrations were high near the Asian continent maximum around 10 µg/m 3 in the YS and decreased toward the open oceans around 1 µg/m 3 in the NP and WNP . In contrast, the amount of wet deposition per unit area was same at 50–100 mg/m 2 in the ocean regions in East Asia. The wet deposition showed small peaks during wintertime over open oceans NP and WNP and the SJ, relatively constant throughout the year in the ECS, and a distinct peak during summertime in the YS. The large amount of wet deposition in the YS was partly related to the intense precipitation by the Baiu front during June and July in this area. The nearby ground-based observation sites may not be representative of the ocean regions studied; hence, the absolute value did not correspond quantitatively. However, the seasonal variations corresponded well. This suggests that the seasonal behavior is dominated by synoptic scale meteorology.Seasonal variations of a atmospheric concentration of NO 3 − , and b wet deposition of NO 3 − over ocean regions. Lines with colors corresponding to the colors of the investigation areas in Figure  1 a represent 3 year averaged model results, and shaded areas show the range of model results between the years of 2002 and 2004. Coarse-mode ratios for NO 3 − are also shown with dark dotted lines in Figure  3 a. Observation sites located near the investigated ocean regions are noted to allow available observation data sets to be retrieved.The modeled deposition amounts of NO y through each deposition processes over East Asian oceans are summarized in Table  1 . Based on 23 different atmospheric global chemical transport models, the ensemble-averaged estimation for the year 2000 indicated nitrate NO 3 − and HNO 3 deposition of 200–400 mg N/m 2 /yr over marginal seas and 100–300 mg N/m 2 /yr over open oceans in East Asia. In this study, NO y deposition amounts were in the range of 335 YS to 478 TS  mg N/m 2 /yr over marginal seas and 230 NP to 289 WNP  mg N/m 2 /yr over open oceans Table  1 , which corresponded well to the estimates by Dentener et al .. We also list the constituents of NO y in Table  1 as fine-mode NO 3 − , coarse-mode NO 3 − , HNO 3 , and other NO y . The deposition over oceans mainly consisted of wet deposition of fine-mode NO 3 − , dry and wet deposition of coarse-mode NO 3 − , and dry deposition of HNO 3 . PAN was the main component of the other NO y we assessed over the oceans. The spatial distribution pattern of NO y deposition and their summary over China, Korea, and Japan are given in Text S4 .Nakamura et al . stated that the annual maximal river discharge of nitrate from the Yangtze River is 430 Gg N/yr. Our estimated NO 3 − and HNO 3 deposition in the ECS from the atmosphere 252 Gg N/yr corresponded to 59% of this river discharge, which cannot be neglected in the ECS ocean ecosystem. Zhang et al . also simulated the atmospheric deposition of inorganic nitrogen including NH x into the ECS as 166 Gg N N/yr by using the regional model of CMAQ. Their estimated total nitrate deposition was 106 Gg N/yr, and similar to the value in our previous study of 140 Gg N/yr. These studies were limited by the exact treatment of coarse-mode NO 3 − produced via the reaction with sea salt and/or dust. The NO y deposition amounts were, respectively, 733 Gg N/yr over marginal seas and 730 Gg N/yr over open oceans, and the sum of these totals was 1463 Gg N/yr. The NO y depositions without coarse-mode NO 3 − were 446 Gg N/yr over marginal seas and 329 Gg N/yr over open oceans. NO y deposition was increased by 1.6 and 2.2 times over marginal seas and open oceans, respectively, by including coarse-mode NO 3 − , resulting in the increase of 1.9 times over East Asian oceans. These results suggest that the role of coarse-mode NO 3 − deposition over East Asian oceans is particularly important especially above open oceans.Finally, the deposition amount and its relationship with the NO x emissions originating from anthropogenic sources are discussed. Figure  4 illustrates the amounts of anthropogenic NO x emissions from China, Korea, and Japan top , which were 5377, 408, and 807 Gg N/yr, respectively, and NO y deposition over marginal seas and open oceans in East Asia bottom averaged over 2002–2004. Because 82% of the total NO x emissions from China, Korea, and Japan were from anthropogenic emissions from China, we investigated the relationship between the deposition amounts and NO x emissions from China. Uno et al . reported that the total nitrate except for coarse-mode NO 3 − in the ECS corresponded to 3.2% of NO x emissions from China, based on correlation analyses. In this study, the deposition amount in the ECS was 2.5% of NO x emissions from China not including coarse-mode NO 3 − , and 4.9% including coarse-mode NO 3 − estimated from the proportion of the deposition amount to NO x emissions from China . As we have shown in Text S4 , large amount of NO y was also deposited over China. Taking into account that the NO x emissions from China are deposited as NO y at a rate of 2317 Gg N/yr, the net outflow of NO y from China was 3060 Gg N/yr. Consequently, the NO y deposition amount of 1463 Gg N/yr over East Asian oceans corresponded to almost half 48% of the amount of NO y exported from China.Summary of anthropogenic NO x emission and NO y deposition amounts over marginal seas and open oceans over East Asia averaged for 2002–2004. White arrows represent NO x emission and NO y deposition above China, Korea, and Japan from left to right, and colored arrows indicate NO y deposition amount for each region see Figure  1 .The effect of dust on coarse-mode NO 3 − was not treated directly in this study. Recent work that included a mineral dust emission scheme and related chemical reactions reported an annual increase of NO 3 − concentration of 0.1–0.5 µg/m 3 5–25% over East Asian oceans. The differences in the EANET observations during dust and nondust years were summarized in Text S5 . The observed differences of 0.1 µg/m 3 11.8% for atmospheric NO 3 − were within the range of the model estimation reported by Karydis et al .. Based on the observation summary, the deposition amounts listed in Table  1 can be refined; the mineral dust consideration lead to a 17% increase of NO y deposition over the SJ. Large amount of atmospheric HNO 3 are deposited over land, however, once the mineral dust produces coarse-mode NO 3 − that can be transported over the downwind oceans. The importance of the effects of coarse-mode NO 3 − produced via sea salt through the year is clarified in this study. In future work, we intend to investigate the treatment of sea salt and mineral dust in our modeling system and evaluate deposition.We used the regional chemical transport model including the production of coarse-mode NO 3 − from the interaction of HNO 3 and sea salt particles, to overcome the aforementioned limitations of our previous study. The modeling reproducibility of atmospheric concentrations, wet deposition, and the coarse-mode ratio in NO 3 − was evaluated by comparing observation data sets. The deposition amount of NO y was a total of 1463 Gg N/yr, and this estimate was increased by a factor of 1.9 when coarse-mode NO 3 − was included. The anthropogenic NO x emissions from China amount 5377 Gg N/yr, which is 82% of the total NO x emissions from China, Korea, and Japan. The NO y deposition over oceans in East Asia 1463 Gg N/yr corresponded to 48% of the export amount from China 3060 Gg N/yr . The observed differences between dust and nondust years suggested the 17% increase in the NO y deposition amounts was caused by mineral dust.Anthropogenic NO x emissions from China increased by more than twofold during 2000–2010; therefore, an increase of nitrogen deposition over oceans is expected compared with the period of 2002–2004 analyzed in this study. A coupled physical-ecosystem model suggested that primary production could respond linearly to changes in the deposition in the SJ during summer months. These responses and the importance of atmospheric deposition may be limited depending on the oceanic characteristics, especially over highly productive areas. However, the large variations in oceanic ecosystems in East Asia triggered by growing atmospheric inputs of nitrogen compounds are worrisome. It has been reported that the average annual bulk deposition of nitrogen over China increased between the 1980s and 2000s with a large increase rate for nitrate rather than ammonium; therefore, long-term variations in nitrogen deposition in East Asian oceans and the responses of ecosystems should be studied further."
20,dust climate clouds atmosphere,"Extreme detached dust layers near Martian volcanoes: Evidence for dust transport by mesoscale circulations forced by high topography. Modeling suggests that thermal circulations over Mars's highest volcanoes transport water vapor and dust from the surface into the middle atmosphere, forming detached layers in these constituents. Intense vertical mixing also takes place in regional and global dust storms, which can generate detached layers that are extreme in both altitude and magnitude. Here we employ observations by the Mars Climate Sounder MCS on board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, taking advantage of improved vertical coverage in MCS's aerosol retrievals, to discover a new class of extreme detached dust layers EDDLs . Observed during minimal dust storm activity and furthermore distinguished by their potentially large and measurable horizontal extent >1000km , these EDDLs cluster near Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes, from which they likely originate. The existence of these EDDLs suggests that vertical mixing by topographic circulations can be much stronger than previously modeled and more frequent than previously observed. Mars's atmosphere contains topographically driven circulations at scales on the order of tens to hundreds of kilometers “the mesoscale” , whose contribution to surface winds can greatly exceed the contribution of the general circulation locally. Meteorological phenomena observed in visible imagery of Mars's shield volcanoes have been simulated using mesoscale models, which predict high rates of horizontal and vertical transport of dust and water vapor over the volcanoes. These studies inferred significant transport by circulations over smaller-scale topographic features and therefore concluded that mesoscale topographic circulations significantly contributed to the vertical injection of dust and water vapor above 40 km in altitude., 2015 . Retrievals from both in-track and cross-track observations are used. Descriptions of the retrieved data set, the improvements to the retrieval algorithm, and the conversion of retrieved aerosol opacity to mass mixing ratio are included in the supporting information Texts S1 and S2 .EDDLs are a phenomenon known from global and regional dust events but not previously defined quantitatively. A DDL has two main characteristics: a magnitude the maximum dust mass mixing ratio in the layer and altitude the height at which its magnitude is defined . More complex structures are possible but are less common. By comparing the vertical dust distribution between periods with global or large regional dust storms and the same season in a different Mars Year with low dust storm activity , we define an EDDL as a DDL whose magnitude is at least 47 ppm and whose altitude is at least 50 km above the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter MOLA datum. Further details about this definition are provided in the supporting information Text S3 .All retrievals n  = 5,914,246 from in-track or cross-track observations during MCS limb-scanning operations from 24 September 2006 to 31 May 2014 L s  = 111° of Mars Year MY 28 to L s  = 139° of MY 32 were surveyed for EDDLs. Of these, 21,817 contained potential EDDLs. Four criteria then were applied by automated methods to exclude potentially spurious retrieval features, such as confusion of dust with water ice; and EDDLs that could be reliably attributed to dust storm activity, mostly relying upon the dust storm catalog of Wang and Richardson during MY 28–30, the only peer-reviewed dust storm catalog for the period. Note that all nightside retrievals were excluded to eliminate rare instances of potential confusion between dust and CO 2 ice. The automated survey is fully described and justified in the supporting information Text S4 .At the end of the automated survey, 713 retrievals remained. The remaining retrievals then were manually inspected. Of these, 346 were excluded because the layers were not resolved; they lacked strong contrast between low and high mass mixing ratio below and above the apparent layer altitude. Another 47 retrievals were excluded because they occurred less than 2° of L s after regional dust storms cataloged by Wang and Richardson and were similar in properties and geographic distribution to EDDLs observed during those dust storms. It appears that EDDLs are present in the atmosphere even during the decay phase of some storms. An additional 74 retrievals were excluded because they occurred during two regional dust storms that reached the low latitudes during Mars Year 31. The full survey therefore identified 225 retrievals containing EDDLs not associated with regional or global dust storm activity. In all of these instances, Mars Color Imager MARCI imagery was examined to determine if dust lifting was occurring near where EDDL activity was observed. The full results of the manual survey are in Table S1 .A secondary survey also was conducted of dayside limb radiance observations during MCS limb-scanning operations from 24 September 2006 to 31 May 2014 in order to better characterize the vertical dust structure associated with EDDLs when the limb is too optically thick for successful retrieval. Converting this information to brightness temperature helps identify “loop features” in MCS data Figures  1a–1d , red arrows , which are created when a laterally finite, vertically narrow aerosol feature rises and sets in MCS's field of view as it moves along MRO's orbit while observing the forward limb. a–c Brightness temperature K for the labeled MCS channels for 0:00–4:00 UTC, 10 October 2006; d Visible/near-infrared channel A6 radiance counts . Each A6 count is 3.09 ±0.15  × 10 −3  W sr −1  m −2  µm −1 . Loop and castellation features are indicated by red and blue arrows, respectively; e Latitude of the tangent point at 40 km altitude for the limb observation. The abscissa is the integrated along-surface distance between observed scenes 10 4  km , which shows the horizontal extent of the features.The secondary survey focused on “castellation features,” which also have radiance at atypically high altitudes in the context of a single orbit. Unlike loop features, however, castellation features have no hole at their center Figures  1a–1d , blue arrows . The filled appearance of the castellation feature implies observation of a vertically broad feature. As in the case of loop features, these features appear to reach higher altitudes than they actually do because of the geometry of the observation, so it is important to survey retrievals and radiance data in tandem. In addition, the 225 retrievals identified in the EDDL survey were surveyed for association with castellation features, loop features, or neither. Additional details about the radiance data surveys as well as their results are in the supporting information Text S5 and Tables S1 and S2 .We identified 225 EDDL-containing retrievals not associated with regional or global dust storm activity. The vast majority 211 of these retrievals are in one geographic region of interest ROI , 30°S–60°N, 100°–180°W, which comprises only 10% of the Martian surface Figures  2a–2e . Orbits with >2 EDDL-containing retrievals and/or castellation features are common in the ROI and rare outside of it. In most years, these retrievals cluster near Olympus Mons Figures  2 a and 2c–2e . In MY 29, they cluster south of Olympus Mons and northwest of Arsia Mons. This distinctive class of EDDLs is most commonly observed in early northern summer L s  = 100°–120° , is rarely observed in the middle of northern summer, and has secondary maxima in activity around L s  = 180° Figure  2 f . As explained in the supporting information Text S6 , the data in Figure  2 f can be used to estimate the layer formation frequency, which ranges from 0.12 sol −1 at L s  = 100°–110° to ~0.05 sol −1 around northern autumnal equinox. The EDDLs in the ROI therefore form a distinctive class that is closely associated with Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes. a–e The locations of EDDL-containing retrievals not associated with regional or global dust events and observed during the labeled Mars Years are plotted over color contours of MOLA topography km . Red, blue, and black markers indicate orbits with castellation, loop, or no features, respectively. Retrievals from orbits with three or more retrievals containing EDDLs are plotted with crosses. All other retrievals are plotted with dots. The black box outlines the ROI at 180°–100°W, 30°S–60°N; f Fraction of orbits in bins of 10° of L s during which EDDLs not associated with regional or global dust events are observed in the ROI % . Red bars plot uncertainty based on either omitting or including one EDDL erroneously, as implied by the secondary survey supporting information: Text S5 . The included orbits are those that sample the ROI on the dayside and were not excluded from the automated and manual retrieval surveys because of regional or global dust storm activity.In rare instances, an EDDL is clearly traceable to one of these volcanoes. Just before northern autumnal equinox in MY 29, MCS observed a castellation feature Figures  3 a and 3 b directly over Arsia Mons Figure  3 i . This feature is associated with EDDL-containing retrievals and unusually warm temperatures for this altitude up to 75 km above the MOLA datum Figures  3 e and 3 f . MARCI observed a dust cloud over Arsia Mons at the same time Figure S2 .Castellation features in brightness temperature K for MCS channels b, d A1 sensitive to middle atmospheric temperature and a, c A5 sensitive to dust , as labeled; estimated e, g dust mass mixing ratio ppm and f, h temperature K retrieved from radiance data from the interval plotted in the panels above, as labeled. Areas with significant gaps in retrieval coverage are whited out rather than interpolated; i Latitude and longitude of the limb tangent point of the radiance observations solid line and retrievals cross for the leftmost panels and dot for the rightmost panels are plotted over color contours of topography km .In most instances, however, observations do not clearly demonstrate that EDDLs originate from a volcano. Just after northern summer solstice of MY 29, MCS observed a castellation feature associated with an EDDL to the south of Olympus Mons and the northwest of Arsia Mons Figures  3 c, 3 d, and 3f–3i . MARCI imagery, however, does not show dust lifting on either volcano. In fact, dust lifting on a volcano and an EDDL are simultaneously observed in only two instances, though dust lifting near a volcano is observed at the same time as an EDDL on a small number of occasions Table S1 .Some EDDLs can be sequentially traced across multiple orbits for up to a sol: a potential constraint on the source and extent of the EDDL. Typical sequences show EDDL magnitudes decaying to the west Figures  4a–4c . In one case, EDDL-containing retrievals are observed just north of Olympus Mons, 1 sol after the initial EDDL observations Figure  4 b . In another case, an EDDL of lower magnitude is found ~1500 km to the west of the initial EDDL observations near the volcanoes. However, these EDDLs were observed between Arsia Mons and Olympus Mons Figure  4 c , adding to ambiguity about their source. When both orbits are close to the volcanoes, EDDL magnitude does not decay to the west as much, but gaps in retrieval coverage do not allow orbits to be compared at the same latitude Figure  4 d . In addition, the maximum extent of an EDDL may be even larger than Figures  4a–4d suggest. In the most extreme example Figure  4 e , EDDL-containing retrievals of high magnitude were observed just to the north of Olympus Mons. Within 4 h, EDDL-containing retrievals of lower magnitude were observed up to 3500 km to the north and west of Olympus Mons. a–f Examples of EDDLs not associated with regional or global dust events that are observed on the same or following sol, as labeled. Retrieval locations are plotted over topography km color contours . Retrievals in orbits containing or lacking a castellation feature in the ROI are colored red and black, respectively. The radiance data for the earliest two orbits in Figure  4 b is plotted in Figure  1 . Marker type indicates the azimuthal direction of the limb observations from which the retrievals were made, as shown in the legend. Marker size is proportional to the sum of a constant and the highest value of dust mass mixing ratio in the retrieval at an altitude at least 50 km above the areoid. The numeric labels to the right and left of the retrieval markers indicate temporal separation of the retrievals relative to the “0” marker in hours. For clarity, these markers match the color of the retrievals in the orbit. Numeric labels associated with cross-track observations are rendered in an oblique font in Figure  4 f.When MCS performs in-track and cross-track observations along the same orbit, the longitudinal extent of the EDDL can be evaluated synchronously and at higher resolution than ~1500 km separation between orbits. The MCS retrievals surveyed provide one example of retrievals containing low-magnitude EDDLs observed southeast of the Tharsis Montes from both in-track and west-looking cross-track observations in the same orbit Figure  4 f . Higher-magnitude EDDL-containing retrievals from one set of cross-track observations in the next orbit were observed 2 h later directly between the EDDL-containing retrievals from the previous orbit Figure  4 f , suggesting that an EDDL of ~1200 km longitudinal extent was indeed present.The class of EDDLs described in the previous section is a new addition to several classes of mesospheric aerosol layers that have been reported at Mars but is distinct from all of them. It consists of dust layers observed above 50 km altitude outside of regional or global dust events and almost entirely during L s  = 80°–220°. It is therefore distinct from 1 EDDLs associated with the largest dust storms; 2 equatorial mesospheric clouds composed of water or CO 2 ice which are highly active from L s  = 0°–60° ; 3 mesospheric ice clouds observed in the northern midlatitudes during northern autumn and winter; and 4 the mixed dust/water ice cloud trails that form at 50 km altitude over Valles Marineris during L s  = 230°–260°.Observing this class of EDDLs is enabled by MCS's unique combination of capabilities: 1 systematic mapping of the limb along the MRO orbit, 2 ability to distinguish between dust and ices, and 3 vertical range of 0–80 km altitude. These capabilities are fully leveraged by allowing aerosol retrieval over the full vertical range of the observations. These layers are vanishingly rare in MCS retrievals 0.004% of the total but should be more identifiable in MCS retrievals than in comparable data sets. Mars Express's Spectroscopy for Investigation of Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Mars SPICAM coverage is sparse at the season and latitudes at which these layers are observed by MCS. Moreover, SPICAM cannot distinguish between dust and ice. Some layers of this class could have been observed by Mars Global Surveyor's Thermal Emission Spectrometer TES limb observations, but TES's vertical range only extends to 65 km.We propose that this new class of EDDLs results from dust lifting within mesoscale circulations over Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes. Five lines of argument justify their topographic origin. First, these EDDLs are strongly concentrated near Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes. Second, when traced across multiple orbits, EDDL magnitude is generally higher near the volcanoes than far away from them Figures  4a–4c and 4 e . Third, one EDDL could be traced over Olympus Mons from one sol to the next Figure  4 b . Fourth, in the simulations of Michaels et al ., the topographic circulation also supported water ice cloud formation extending to the west-northwest. The seasonal peak in Olympus Mons water ice cloud coverage and west-northwest orientation of the cloud deck occurs at L s  = 100°–125° and is therefore synchronous with the season of maximum EDDL activity Figure  2 f . Fifth, the leading evidence for mesoscale circulations over Mars's high topography is the spiral cloud that forms over Arsia Mons around northern autumnal equinox each year. MCS observed a castellation feature and EDDL-containing retrievals over Arsia Mons during a spiral cloud event observed by MARCI at L s  = 177° of MY 29 Figures  3 a, 3 b, 3 e, 3 f, 3 i, and Figure S2 in the supporting information , an observation that directly connects the new class of EDDLs with observed dust lifting within a presumptive mesoscale topographic circulation.Vertically profiling mesoscale topographic circulations revises our understanding of these phenomena. These circulations transport dust much higher in the atmosphere than previously modeled. Dust in the Arsia Mons spiral cloud simulation reached as high as 40 km above the datum, ~35 km below the altitude dust reached in MCS observations Figure  4 c . These circulations also are dustier than previously modeled. Rafkin et al . predicted that spiral cloud dust mass mixing ratios are up to a few ppm. Michaels et al . predicted that dust layers generated by topographic circulations may be more than 2 orders of magnitude more than the background concentration. Both of these studies rely on NASA Ames Mars Global Climate Model simulations to set their boundary conditions. Therefore, the background dust mass mixing ratio at 40 km above the datum is ~0.1 ppm, suggesting that layers with magnitudes of up to a few tens of ppm were simulated. However, all of the layers we report are higher in magnitude.These differences between MCS's observations and prior simulations suggest that topographic circulations can lift more dust and/or contain stronger vertical updrafts than previously simulated. Because the properties of DDLs generated by topographic circulations can be similar to those generated by global dust events, the winds and intensity of dust lifting within topographic circulations may be similar to the poorly known core areas of activity during regional and global dust events. Dust storm cores may contain vertical winds of up to 30 ms −1 . Updrafts in topographic circulations also may transport water vapor to high altitudes; perhaps explaining widespread detached water vapor layering in northern spring and summer, or at least why water vapor mixing ratios at the summits of the Tharsis volcanoes are significantly enriched relative to their bases.Dust lifting by topographic circulations also may be more common than visible imagery has suggested. While at least two EDDLs were observed when there was a dust storm imaged over a volcano, most were observed when dust clouds were absent from nearby volcanoes, perhaps suggesting that dust lifting in topographic mesoscale circulations generally takes place before midafternoon 15:00 local solar time . In that case, dust storms associated with the volcanoes may be more common than previous observations suggested. It is also possible that topographic mesoscale circulations generate a population of lower magnitude, more frequently forming layers at lower altitudes. Such a population, however, would be difficult to distinguish from the climatological dust distribution Text S3 .The seasonality of EDDL formation suggests that dust storm activity on the volcanoes may follow a pattern observed in the southern hemisphere, in which local dust storm activity follows the subsolar point, suggesting that dust lifting is driven by thermal contrasts. Over the volcanoes, this effect would be maximized at the subsolar point, since topographic mesoscale circulations are driven by thermal contrast between the quickly heating summit and slowly heating slopes. When the Sun is overhead at noon, the summit is heated at direct incidence and the slopes indirectly. This makes it plausible that the EDDLs reported here originate from volcano-enhanced local dust storms. Lifting on Olympus Mons would primarily drive the maximum in activity during early northern summer and the secondary maximum would be driven by dust lifting on Arsia or Pavonis Montes.We combine MCS radiance observations and retrievals with improved vertical aerosol coverage to detect mesoscale circulations in Mars's atmosphere previously inferred from visible imagery. We demonstrate the existence of EDDLs with altitudes of up to 75 km above the MOLA datum but which occur outside of global or regional dust storm activity. We argue that the large number of such EDDLs observed near Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes are due to infrequent occurring every 8–20 sols during Martian northern summer local dust storms within mesoscale circulations over the Martian volcanoes. That the magnitude and altitude of these DDLs are much higher than previously modeled suggests that vertical updrafts in these storms are more intense than previously realized. In addition, local dust storms over high topography also may be more common than previously thought. These observations provide important constraints for quantifying the role that topographic mesoscale circulations play in aerosol and volatile exchange between the surface and the middle atmosphere of Mars.In the originally published version of this article, the altitude above the areoid of atmospheric aerosol in Mars Climate Sounder MCS retrievals was incorrectly calculated, except in the analysis presented in Text S3 and Figure S1 of the Supporting Information SI . This error resulted in the occurrence and altitudes of extreme detached dust layers EDDL over high terrain to be underestimated and the retrieval plots in Figure 3 to be distorted. Corrected analysis also shows a difference in the number of EDDLs and the character of the secondary peak in activity around northern autumnal equinox, which has been corrected in the text in Sections 2. Figures 2 and 4 have been re-plotted to include only EDDLs identified by the corrected analysis.The Supporting Information also has been updated to reflect the corrected analysis, in particular the numbers of retrievals that passed the various criteria for definition as EDDLs see sections S4 and S6 of the Supporting Information text and the altitudes of EDDLs in Table S1.Supporting Information also had incorrectly claimed that in 33 or 34 cases, layers were not traceable from one orbit to another; however, this is only true if the region of interest ROI is meant. And almost all of the cases outside the ROI are not traceable from orbit to orbit. The supporting information has been updated to correct this claim."
21,dust aerosol,"Impact of soil moisture on dust outbreaks in East Asia: Using satellite and assimilation data. This study is the first assessment of the effects of soil moisture on dust outbreaks using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth AOD and global assimilation data on the sand regions across East Asia. The relationships among dust outbreaks, soil moisture, and wind speed were estimated using data sets of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Global Land Data Assimilation System collected over 11years 2003-2013 . The mean AOD exponentially decreased with increasing soil moisture under different wind speed conditions average determination coefficient=0.95 . As the wind speed conditions became stronger, the probability of a dust outbreak became greatly affected by soil moisture. The threshold soil moisture for dust outbreaks increased with increasing wind speed and decreased with increasing dust-outbreak criteria of AOD. Our results have the capability to be applied to satellite-based dust-outbreak prediction and global-scale dust-emission studies. Sand dust has direct implications for public health, transportation, and agriculture, with indirect effects on climate through modification of the microphysical properties of clouds. In addition, it is considered one of the major sources of the tropospheric aerosol component, which plays an important role in climate systems and affects the atmospheric radiation budget by scattering and absorbing longwave and shortwave radiation.Surface wind speed has generally been regarded as the main factor determining the mobilization of sand and dust in dust-source regions. However, dust events are influenced not only by wind speed but also by surface conditions. Surface conditions such as soil moisture determine the threshold friction velocity for a dust outbreak on bare soil, except in conditions of extreme cold or in the presence of coarse soil particles, because soil moisture increases the cohesive forces between soil particles; therefore, moistened sand requires higher wind speed to generate a dust event, especially under humid conditions.Many efforts have been made in laboratories and observatories to elucidate the mechanisms of dust emissions from moistened sand. However, such research has limited application for estimating the relationship between soil moisture on a global scale, and for natural dust events. To understand the mechanisms linking dust events and soil moisture trends on a global scale, employment of satellite-based and global assimilation data would be required.With the development of satellite remote sensing and data-assimilating techniques, application to several hydrological research fields has been achieved. In dust research, satellite remote sensing has provided a powerful tool for characterization of global dust properties, and the aerosol product data obtained provide more objective and quantitative measurement criteria than visibility inspection by the human eye. Moreover, data-assimilating techniques i.e., Global Land Data Assimilation System GLDAS allow assessment of global land surface conditions through integration of satellite- and ground-based data and use of several land surface models.In the present study, satellite-derived aerosol products and global assimilation data were linked to estimate the effect of soil moisture on dust phenomena over sand areas in East Asia. Through this analysis, the following were characterized: 1 the relationships among volumetric soil moisture 0–10 cm , wind speed, and aerosol optical depth; 2 dust-outbreak possibilities and threshold soil moisture; and 3 the effect of soil moisture on dust outbreaks and threshold wind speed.The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS sensors aboard the Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua polar orbiter platforms are specially designed to analyze atmospheric i.e., cloud and aerosol and land properties i.e., surface reflectance and evapotranspiration with reliable accuracy. MODIS deep blue 550 nm aerosol optical depth AOD data were selected for this study because these data have already been extensively validated by several researchers in field studies. Moreover, deep blue data maintain accuracy even over bright desert surfaces, whereas other satellite-based algorithms have difficulty obtaining accurate reading. For details about the Deep Blue algorithm, please refer to Hsu et al .. Level 2 MODIS deep blue AOD Aqua products reported daily at noon at a spatial resolution of 0.01° × 0.01° are available for 2003 to the present. Herein, the level 2 AOD data were resampled to a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° to match the resolution of the Global Land Data Assimilation System GLDAS .GLDAS has used several satellites i.e., NOAA, Terra, and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission , and ground-based data set i.e., Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation, National Centers for Environmental Prediction, and National Center for Atmospheric Research in order to characterize the state of the land surface. GLDAS products have been widely analyzed at a spatial resolution from 0.25° × 0.25° to 1° × 1°. In particular, GLDAS products are commonly used as reference values for validation of satellite-retrieved soil moisture contents. GLDAS/Noah products reported every 3 h at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° are available for 2000 to the present. In the analyses, wind speed WS at 10.0 m height, volumetric soil moisture VSM , and soil temperature at a depth of 0–10.0 cm, and rainfall rate from GLDAS data were employed, with times proximate to MODIS AOD retrieval.The Harmonized World Soil Database HWSD is a raster database at a spatial resolution of 1 km with more than 16,000 different soil texture mapping units. It combines existing regional and national updates on soil information, with a 1:5,000,000 scale Food and Agriculture Organization-United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Soil Map of the World. The HWSD consists of 221 million grid cells covering the globe's land territory, and it has been used in the identification of dust sources, as well as for and applied in many other research fields.In this study, sand areas were defined using the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA topsoil texture classifications from the HWSD data sets. Figure  1 shows the spatial distribution of the East Asian sand fraction. Sand fraction pixels indicating a sand fraction of more than 80% were classified as sand areas. These include many famous bare deserts in East Asia already known to be major dust-source regions.Sand fraction over East Asia, based on Harmonized World Soil Database HWSD . Most areas have more than 80% sand fraction #1 to #6, 6790 pixels total , classified as sand by the USDA classification. Areas #1 to #8 show well-known dust sources in East Asia.To allow accurate analysis of the effects of soil moisture on dust outbreaks, several specific conditions were excluded. First, pixels below 0°C were masked for occurrence of frost- and snow-covered sand areas. Second, days on which precipitation occurred were excluded to avoid use of instantaneous AOD data detected just before and after rainfall events. Third, the fine mode aerosol caused by transported dust or biomass burning was eliminated using the threshold of an Angström Exponent larger than 0.35. With these exclusions in place, we assembled 11 years of AOD, VSM, and WS data, each with 0.25° × 0.25° grid cells over the East Asian sand areas from the MODIS and GLDAS data. From the East Asian sand areas 6790 pixels , a total of 27.261 million data points were employed in the analysis.To allow simultaneous consideration of various VSM and WS conditions, we divided the VSM range at 1.0% intervals and WS at 1.0 ms −1 intervals. Through this combination 375 C 2 , 375 groups of ranged VSM 5.0 to less than 30.0% and ranged WS 0.0 to less than 15.0 ms −1 were obtained. The general VSM values ranged from 5.0% to 26.0% over the East Asian sand regions during the 11 years of the study period.Figure  2 shows the monthly variation of the total number of AOD at 0.5 interval and the total number of strong wind speed occurrences during 11 years. Strong wind speed is commonly used in dust research to explain dust outbreaks. To estimate the relationship between strong wind speed and AOD, a specific AOD value was designed as the dust-outbreak state using criteria from the previous research of Park et al .. According to Park et al ., AOD values from 1.0 to 3.0 represent the dust-outbreak state. Strong wind speeds and AOD values higher than 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 were found to have high correlation coefficient values of 0.76, 0.80, and 0.83, respectively. This suggested that high AOD range AOD range represents an AOD higher than a specific range could be used as a reasonable criterion for defining dust outbreaks. These results supported the findings of Kurosaki and Mikami , which showed the tendency of correlation between strong wind speed and dust outbreak frequency. This indicates that the linking of satellite-based data with assimilation data can be employed for diverse dust-related research on a regional scale.Variation of total number of strong wind speed ≥6.5 ms −1 , AOD ≥ 1.0 , AOD ≥ 1.5 , and AOD ≥ 2.0 occurrences in different months for 11 years over the East Asian sand regions.Figure  3 represents an AOD under a condition grid cell with VSM ranging from i to i  + 1 % , and WS from j to j  + 1  ms −1 along the bottom of the x axis S i W j . For statistical analysis, the S i W j groups for which less than 25 samples were available were rejected. For example, S 9 W 5 denotes a condition grid cell with a VSM of 9.0 to 10.0% and a WS of 5.0 to 6.0 ms −1 . To give a better understanding, the S i W 3 x axis zone shows WS fixed at 3.0 to 4.0 ms −1 upper x axis with VSM ranging from 5.0 to 30.0% lower x axis . Without considering the effect of soil moisture, the mean AOD climbed steadily with increasing WS black solid line and upper x axis . However, when the effect of soil moisture was applied to the relationship between AOD and WS, the mean AOD under S i W j condition A O D mean | S i W j varied significantly with soil moisture in different WS conditions black dots, lower x axis . As expected, most A O D mean | S i W j showed a decreasing pattern with increasing soil moisture. In order to lift the sand particles containing higher moistures, stronger wind speed is required to overcome the cohesive strength between soil particles.The relationships among AOD, WS, and VSM. Y axis shows AOD values under different S i W j conditions. Black dots indicate mean AOD value under S i W j conditions. The gray line for each dot indicates standard deviation. Black triangles represent averaged AOD values under different wind speed conditions upper x axis .Further investigation into the AOD, VSM, and WS relationships is depicted in Figure  4 . An exponential decrease of A O D mean | S i W j was observed with increasing soil moisture under different WS conditions. This relationship can be explained by equation 1 . The relationship of averaged AOD and VSM under different wind speed conditions. The upper part of the graph indicates stronger wind speed conditions. Constants C 1  and  C 2 and statistical information for each line are included.Each A O D mean | S i W j regression function had a high R 2 value 0.83 to 0.98 , low root-mean-square error value 0.23 to 0.02 , and low sum of squared errors value 0.01 to 0.48 Figure  4 . The constants C 1 and C 2 varied with WS conditions. Equation 1 and Figure  4 illustrate that given a fixed VSM, the variation of A O D mean | S i W j increased as WS became stronger. In fixed WS conditions fixed C 1 and C 2 , however, the variation of A O D mean | S i W j decreased as VSM increased. Higher A O D mean | S i W j variation is therefore associated with higher WS and lower VSM. However, under wet conditions VSM larger than about 16% , the A O D mean | S i W j values were barely affected by WS conditions.In Figure  5 , the height of the bar indicates the total number of S i W j conditions N all | S i W j , while the height of the gray bar indicates the total number of occurrences of AOD range within the S i W j conditions N AOD range over the East Asian sand areas from 2003 to 2013. The black line indicates the AOD range probability for a sand area under S i W j condition, calculated using equation 2 . a–c Each bar graph shows the total number of S i W j over East Asian sand areas from 2003 to 2013. Gray bars indicate the total number of specific ranged-AOD occurrences under S i W j conditions N A O D range . The bar height indicates the total number of S i W j conditions N all | S i W j . The black line graph shows the specific range of AOD occurrence probability given a particular S i W j condition.This method was suitable because the satellite data had coarse temporal resolution characteristics. This statistical procedure was also used in previous studies. In Figure  5 a, under S i W 5 condition, VSM and the dust-outbreak probability are denoted when the dust-outbreak criterion is 1.5 AOD. In lower WS conditions Figure  5 a, S i W 5 , little change of the dust-outbreak probability was observed with variation of VSM. In this condition, the dust-outbreak probability standard deviation DPSD value was only about 2.8%. In a higher wind speed condition Figure  5 b, S i W 9 , the DPSD value of 11.6% was observed Table  1 . The DPSD results indicated that dust-outbreak probabilities are highly affected by wind speed and soil moisture conditions. Moreover, the threshold VSM for the dust-emission value was determined using the concept of the most favorable state for dust outbreak from Kurosaki and Mikami . The threshold VSM for dust outbreak represents the maximum value of VSM at which a dust outbreak can occur. The threshold VSM may have significant application for global-scale dust-outbreak prediction and sediment transport functions. The threshold VSM for dust outbreaks tS 5 % increased with WS Table  1 . This result was similar to those of several previous studies, but the present research expanded the scale from the laboratory or observatory to examination of the natural state of an area. Figures  5 b and 5 c applied the same S i W j conditions; however, in Figure  5 c the dust-outbreak criterion decreased from 1.5 to 1.0 AOD. Therefore, the DPSD value increased from 11.6 to 22.0%, and tS 5 % increased from 13.3 to 16.5% Table  1 and Figure  5 . The physical reasoning for the increased tS 5 % is that higher soil moisture content is required in order to increase the capillary forces between soil particles to prevent emission from the source area for less dusty conditions under the same WS condition. Moreover, this result illustrates how, like recording dust outbreaks by human eye judgment, different choices in setting the criterion of a dust outbreak AOD value can lead to seriously differences in the dust-outbreak threshold WS and VSM values. This discrepancy is one of the main explanations for the differing threshold results between studies.Using 11 years of satellite-based data and global assimilation data sets, the effect of soil moisture on dust outbreaks was examined. Previous research depended on laboratory- and observatory-scale data, which have limited value when considering the effects of soil moisture in dust outbreaks on a global scale. Thanks to the development of satellite remote sensing and data-assimilating technology, we were able to consider global-scale soil moisture data for evaluation of dust outbreaks. The following observations were made: This first attempt to derive the dust-outbreak possibilities and threshold soil moisture using satellite-based and assimilation data 0.25° × 0.25° pixel scale demonstrated the potential of determining the effects of soil moisture on dust phenomena beyond laboratory- and observatory-scale analyses. However, the current results are only valid for bare sand areas. Therefore, the soil moisture variation for other types of soil e.g., silt and clay and vegetation dynamics e.g., normalized difference vegetation index needs to be considered in future research."
22,dust particles climate clouds aerosol,"Effects of crystallographic properties on the ice nucleation properties of volcanic ash particles. Specific chemical and physical properties of volcanic ash particles that could affect their ability to induce ice formation are poorly understood. In this study, the ice nucleating properties of size-selected volcanic ash and mineral dust particles in relation to their surface chemistry and crystalline structure at temperatures ranging from -30 to -38 degrees C were investigated in deposition mode. Ice nucleation efficiency of dust particles was higher compared to ash particles at all temperature and relative humidity conditions. Particle characterization analysis shows that surface elemental composition of ash and dust particles was similar; however, the structural properties of ash samples were different. Volcanic eruptions emit enormous quantities of gases and micron- and submicron-sized ash particles that can affect background atmospheric aerosol, climate, and environment. Sulfur dioxide SO 2 g injected into the atmosphere can oxidize to sulfuric acid H 2 SO 4 vapor producing H 2 SO 4 particles, which can then spread globally. Injected ash and H 2 SO 4 particles can significantly contribute to the natural source of aerosols in the atmosphere. Almost every day, volcanic eruptions occur somewhere around the globe, and they provide a constant flux of fine ash into the troposphere. These volcanic erupted aerosol species can also serve as ice nuclei IN and affect the Earth's radiative balance through altering the microphysical properties of ice-containing clouds.Some previous studies observed that ash particles may be efficient sources of atmospheric IN. In these analyses, it was assumed that the ash particle concentration is always low in the background atmosphere. During a volcanic eruption event, it was also observed that IN concentration increased, and therefore, these studies concluded that this increase must suggest that ash particles are efficient IN. Asian dust outflow events may bias these measurements, as Prenni et al . found that the typical elemental composition of IN while flying over the active volcano was similar to mineral dust. On the other hand, Langer et al . suggest that H 2 SO 4 produced from SO 2 g oxidation associated with ash particles could reduce ice-forming efficiency, which lead to the conclusion that volcanic ash could be a poor source of atmospheric IN. More recently, Bingemer et al . found that ash particles collected near the eruption site were less efficient at −18°C and 119% relative humidity with respect to ice conditions in inducing ice nucleation compared to ambient particles collected in central Germany about 2200 km away from the eruption event. More specifically, Steinke et al . observed that ice nucleation efficiency of ash particles is poorer than Arizona test dust ATD; a commonly used proxy mineral for natural atmospheric mineral dust particles. Further, Hoyle et al . investigated ice nucleation efficiency of ash particles from the same volcanic eruption event that Bingemer et al . and Steinke et al . studied and found that ash particles were poor IN in the deposition mode at warmer temperatures only. However, these studies also showed that volcanic ash particles are more efficient than both Asian and Saharan dust particles. Any particular reasons that may explain these results, which concluded that volcanic ash particles were poor and efficient IN in deposition mode with respect to proxy atmospheric and natural mineral dust, respectively, are missing but are crucial to improving our overall understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation activity of ash particles.In this study, we show for the first time that the ash particles may lack necessary crystalline properties that play an important role toward nucleating ice in deposition mode defined here for conditions where relative humidity with respect to water RH w  ≤ 100% or subsaturated conditions . To meet this objective, we performed ice nucleation experiments on size-selected ash particles from the Eyjafjallajökull henceforth referred to as E16 volcanic eruption of April 2010 in deposition mode. To examine the relative importance of ice nucleation behavior of these particles to natural dust particles in deposition mode, we also investigated ice nucleation properties of ATD particles. Further, we applied bulk and single-particle techniques to analyze surface properties, such as surface elemental composition, structural, and shape factor properties, respectively, of ash and ATD species.ATD ultrafine mode; UF was purchased from Powder Technology, Inc. Volcanic ash from E16 was purchased from Nordicstore Inc. and Nammi Inc.; for simplicity, these two samples are referred to as T1 and T2, respectively. Ash particles are further sieved Newark Superla to eliminate particles larger than 20 µm. Sieved ash T1 and T2 and powdered samples of ATD particles were dry-dispersed independently using a dust generator TSI Inc., Model 3433; Figure  S1 in the supporting information . More details are shown in section S2 including experimental schematic Figure  S1 . These dispersed aerosolized particles were size selected based on their mobility diameter d m , in using a differential mobility analyzer DMA; TSI Inc., Model 3080 and transmitted as aerosol to a compact ice chamber CIC and a condensation particle counter CPC; TSI Inc, Model 3010 . The vacuum aerodynamic diameters of size-selected particles were measured with single particle mass spectrometer, SPLAT II, and used to calculate particle effective density ρ eff , from which particle dynamic shape factors were obtained.Size-selected ATD particles were also coated with H 2 SO 4 Sigma Aldrich in the coating apparatus that was maintained at a temperature of 130°C. Briefly, the coating apparatus unit consists of a H 2 SO 4 bath, which is heated using heating tape and its temperature is controlled using a thermostat. The residence time of the particles within the unit was < 5 s, which was achieved by maintaining constant airflow 0.3 LPM Liters per minute . Further details are provided in the supporting information section S1 .The top 10 nm surface composition of sieved ash, powdered samples of ATD particles using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS . XPS was performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer, which consists of a high performance Al K α monochromatic X-ray source 1486.6 eV and a high-resolution spherical mirror analyzer. The X-ray source was operated at 150 W, and the emitted photoelectrons were collected at the analyzer entrance slit normal to the sample surface. The data acquisition was performed in hybrid mode with an analysis area of 700 × 300 µm. The survey spectra were recorded at a pass energy of 160 eV with 0.5 eV step size. The charge neutralizer with low-energy electrons was used to exclude the surface charging effects, and the binding energy of C 1 s at 284.8 eV was used as the charge reference. The chamber pressure was maintained at ~ 5 × 10 −9  torr during the measurements. Finally, the XPS data were analyzed by CasaXPS software using Shirley background correction.Using the X-ray diffraction XRD technique, we identified crystalline phases and structural state of sieved ash, powdered samples of ATD, and acid coated ATD particles. XRD is an analytical technique most widely used for the phase identification and structural properties of materials. MicroXRD data were collected using a Rigaku D/Max Rapid II instrument equipped with a 2-D image plate detector. Ash and ATD particles were dispersed on a sample holder. A MicroMax 007HF generator fitted with a rotating Cr anode wavelength equal to 2.29 Å produced X-rays that were focused on the specimen through a 300 µm diameter collimator. Additionally, Rigaku 2-D Data Processing Software Ver. 1.0, Rigaku, 2007 was used to integrate the diffractions rings captured by the detector. Analysis of the diffraction data was performed out using JADE 9.5 Materials Data, Inc. and the PDF4+ 2012 database from International Centre for Diffraction Data.To investigate the ice nucleating properties of size-selected volcanic ash and ATD, the particles were exposed to controlled temperature and relative humidity conditions in the CIC. The design details of the CIC have been previously described in Stetzer et al . and Friedman et al .. In short, the CIC consists of two vertical parallel plates coated with an ice layer ~ 0.5 mm thick to produce the ice-supersaturated conditions inside of the chamber. CIC also has an evaporation section attached at the bottom of the chamber, again coated with an ice layer ~ 0.5 mm thick, to remove water droplets. Additional details about the CIC regarding cooling and temperature control are described in the Kulkarni et al .. To obtain the RH w conditions at one fixed temperature, the temperature gradient between the plates was adjusted, and using Murphy and Koop vapor pressure formulations, the RH w magnitudes were calculated. The sample and sheath flow used are 1 and 10 LPM, respectively, which limits the aerosol residence time to ~ 12 s within the CIC. Ice nucleation on particles leads to the formation of new ice crystals, with those crystals grown to a size larger than ~ 1.5 µm are counted with an optical particle counter OPC; CLiMET, model CI-3100 . The total number of particles that entered CIC was calculated using sample flow rate and CPC measurements. Further, ice-nucleated fraction F ice of these particles was calculated as the ratio of number of ice crystals measured by the OPC to the total number of particles that entered the CIC. The F ice calculations were averaged over ± 2.5% RH w and plotted against the RH w . When sampling filtered air, F ice were lower than 0.01%. The water breakthrough limit or the critical RH w conditions above which water droplets are not removed from the evaporator section of the CIC was above 110%.Figure  1 shows the XPS survey scans of ATD, T1, and T2 particles. We observed Si, Al, O, Fe, Mg, Na, and Ca on the surface of all three-test samples. Even though the T1 and T2 particles consist of the same elements, T2 shows more Si and less Al compared to T1. Furthermore, data show some variation in concentrations of the other elements between T1 and T2 Table  S1 . In comparison to T1 and T2, ATD has a higher content of Si, but Al concentration is comparable to T1. ATD also has high Mg and low Fe and Na concentrations compared to T1 and T2 particles. Sulfur was not detected in both ash samples. Except for K, Cl, and P elements that were present in minor concentrations <1 at. % , the elements present in T1 and T2 are in agreement with the April 2010 E16 erupted volcanic ash composition reported in the literature Table  S1 . However, atomic concentration % of these elements varied from T1 and T2.XPS spectra of ATD, T1, and T2 particles. The spectra show the elemental composition from the top 10 nm deep of the particle surface.The XRD-calculated crystallographic or structural properties and patterns of ash T1 and T2 , ATD, and coated ATD particles are shown in Table  1 and Figure  S2 , respectively. Various peaks or degrees 2 theta 2 θ reflections indicate characteristic mineral elements. Results indicate that ATD is composed of several minerals such as quartz SiO 2 , albite Na Si 3 Al O 8 , orthoclase KAlSi 3 O 8 , calcite Ca CO 3 , and illite K,H 30 Al 2 Si 3 Al O 10 OH 2 .xH 2 O , and ash was mostly composed of orthoclase, albite, and kaolinite Al 2 Si 2 O 5 OH 4 minerals. Powder XRD patterns from ATD particles revealed numerous intense sharp peaks, suggesting that these particles were polycrystalline in nature. After coating, the peak intensity of some of ATD minerals was decreased significantly. For example, the positions of 2 θ reflections of well-defined peaks of calcite, orthoclase, quartz, illite, and albite in the region between 55° < 2 θ  < 80° for ATD were decreased after coating, see Figure  S2 . The differences in the peak intensities and the calculated crystallite sizes see section S2 of the XRD patterns between the bare and coated ATD suggest that coating resulted in some loss of crystallinity. For example, crystallite size of bare and coated ATD were in the range from 40 to 50 nm and 20 to 30 nm, respectively; indicating crystallite sizes were decreased after coating. Quantitative phase analysis carried out on one ash sample T2 suggested a significant amount of amorphous content ~37 w t% was present. Further, quantitative phase analysis such as Rietveld analysis of XRD data would be necessary to determine the quantity of crystalline and amorphous components. Spectra show that minerals such as kaolinite and calcite were present within T2 but were missing in T1.Measurements of ρ eff provided the information about particle shape section 2.1 , such that particle irregularity roughness and discontinuities increases as ρ eff decreases or dynamic shape factor increases. Figure  2 shows the calculated ρ eff of ATD, T1, and T2 ash particles as a function of particle size. ρ eff of ATD and T2 are nearly identical, decreasing from 1.6 g/cm 3 for 150 nm particles to 1.17 g/cm 3 for 500 nm particles. The ρ eff of 300 nm T1 and T2 ash particles are 1.77 g/cm 3 and 1.42 g/cm 3 , respectively. These differences between the two ash samples might reflect changes in particle shape properties with the time of the eruption.Calculated effective densities of two types of ash particles T1 and T2 and ATD UF as function of mobility diameter.Figure  3 presents a fraction of T1, T2, ATD, and acid-treated particles, all classified at d m  = 300 nm that induced ice nucleation as a function of RH w at temperatures of −30, −34, and −38°C. The vertical error bars are equal to the one standard error of the measurements n  = 4 , and the horizontal error bars are equal to the ± 3% uncertainty in the RH w measurements. The measurements show that the F ice increases as RH w increases consistent with previous studies. The F ice of T1, T2, and coated ATD particles was nearly identical, and their efficiency to nucleate ice was reduced compared to uncoated ATD particles, which had higher F ice as a function of RH w .Ice nucleating fraction of ATD, coated ATD, T1, and T2 particles classified by the DMA at 300 nm. Vertical error bars indicate standard deviations n  = 4 . RH w measurements had ± 3.0 uncertainty. Vertical dashed line indicates RH w  = 100%.Our results demonstrated that crystalline structural properties impact the IN ability of ash and ATD particles. At temperatures ranging from −30 to −38°C and humidity conditions below water saturation, ash T1 and T2 and coated ATD particles showed a reduced ice nucleation ability compared to uncoated ATD particles. XRD analyses show that ATD was composed of quartz, calcite, orthoclase, albite, and illite, while the ash samples had albite, orthoclase, and kaolinite. We observed that T1 and T2 had slightly different XRD spectra, but these differences were not relatable to their ice nucleation ability. Results show that ice nucleation efficiency of both T1 and T2 particles was nearly similar Figure  3 and warrants further research to qualitatively determine the threshold amorphous phase contents to understand the relationship between amorphous phase and IN activity.The crystallographic structure match was considered one of the specific characteristic requirements to be met for a particle to serve as an efficient IN, because crystallographic surface provides preferred configurations for the water molecules to bond and reduce free energy associated with the substrate-ice interface. It is hypothesized that small crystallographic differences between the substrate for example, dust surface in this study and ice will reduce the interface-free energy at the substrate-ice interface and will aid to induce ice formation. These crystallographic properties can be represented with lattice parameters Table  1 ; see section S3 for more details . For example, the lattice dimensions a, b, and c of orthoclase mineral, which is a K-feldspar group mineral identified as an efficient ice nucleating mineral, from ATD and ash particles are 9.129, 12.248, 7.206, and 8.545, 12.967, 7.301, respectively, in Å. These results clearly indicate the crystal lattice mismatch between test particles and ice. The importance of the lattice structure was also demonstrated by many previous studies, which showed that silver iodide AgI is an efficient IN due to the fact that AgI has similar crystal structure dimensions as hexagonal ice- I h see Table  1 .The importance of crystalline structure toward ice nucleation was further confirmed by coating ATD particles with H 2 SO 4 . We observed that deposition mode efficiency of acid-treated particles was reduced compared to uncoated ATD particles Figure  3 . This is consistent with previous literature data which show that acid coating decreases the ice nucleation efficiency of dust particles. Our XRD results show that acid treatment resulted in reduced crystallinity in the coated ATD particles Figure  S2 and partial dissolution of the calcite content, however, we note that further quantitative phase analysis would be needed to understand the degree of crystallinity that was lost due to acid coating. Reduction in crystallinity is possible because acid treatment can lead to the fragmentation of the layered structure of the dust minerals through various reaction mechanisms. Reitz et al . suggested that surface chemical reactions between H 2 SO 4 and ATD particles lead to various metal and ammonium sulfates compounds and hydrogenated fragments of the sulfate species. These sulfate anions can adsorb strongly to these compounds due to electrostatic attractions, and these adsorbed anions can alter the structural properties. Acid treatment can also lead to exchange of cations of the dust and H + ions of the H 2 SO 4 , and under certain conditions, metallic ions can leach out from the interlayer structure of the dust minerals. It is also possible that amount of soluble material present on a particle may influence ice nucleation mechanism. For example, recently Wex et al . reported that coatings that correspond to a hygroscopicity of about 0.05 would be sufficient to nucleate ice on the surface of the particle that is coated through the immersion mechanism. Acid treatment had shown to modify the surface geometry through dissolution disintegration of crystalline structure , surface chemistry, and active sites that may affect ice nucleating behavior of mineral particles. Recent spectroscopic measurements show that ions within acid solution disrupts the charge density next to mineral surfaces e.g., sapphire and conclude that ion segregation could influence ice nucleation temperatures and structure of ice. Further, it is possible that during E16 or another volcanic event, the volcanic erupted gaseous components such as H 2 SO 4 may have adsorbed at active sites or modified/deteriorated the volcanic ash surface properties, potentially suppressing the ice nucleation ability of ash particles. Recent spectroscopic investigations at water/mica interfaces by Yang et al . report that H 2 SO 4 treatment modified the ordered water structure, suggesting that lack of such structured order could explain why dust particles coated with H 2 SO 4 are relatively poor IN. The study also found that the state of lattice structure is also a function of molarity of the H 2 SO 4 , meaning that the ice nucleating properties of particles also depend upon the magnitude of the coated H 2 SO 4 concentration. Therefore, it is possible that the heterogeneity in the H 2 SO 4 concentration in a volcanic plume could result in processing the ash particles with different deterioration efficiency, and thus few ash particles could be efficient IN compared to others. These results Figure  3 indicated that ash particles might not act as efficient IN in deposition mode, but within the volcanic plume where ash concentrations greatly exceed background mineral dust concentrations their role in glaciating clouds would be important. We suggest that the reason volcanic ash particles investigated by previous studies were poor IN is because these ash particles may lack the necessary crystalline structural properties; however, further characterization of these ash particles is necessary to confirm the role of crystallinity toward ice nucleation.We observed that surface composition elemental of ATD and ash particles were similar. Atomic concentration of elements varied within T1 and T2, but we observed that these variations do not affect ice nucleating properties of these two test samples Figure  3 and section 3.4 . The surface composition was compared with Gíslason et al ., which analyzed the ash sample from the same volcanic event using XPS the analysis methodology that was similar to ours; section 2.1 , and we find a similar elemental distribution.High-resolution scanning electron microscopy images of individual ash particles T1 show that particles are highly irregular in shape and have many steps, cracks, or pores Figure  S3 . These irregular features could act as ice active surface sites at which ice nucleation can be initiated. The importance of these features toward ice nucleation was understood by calculating ρ eff , as described in section 3.3 . We note that ρ eff does not represent the measurement of surface defects, such as steps, cracks, or pores, but is a measure of overall particle shape. T1 and T2 particles of d m  = 300 nm had ρ eff equal to 1.75 and 1.4 g/cm 3 , respectively. The ρ eff of T2 and ATD particles was equal, but these densities were smaller than T1 particles. These differences in the ρ eff , or shape factor section 3.3 , do not seem to influence ice nucleation ability of these particles, because we observed that fraction of T1 and T2 particles that induced ice nucleation was similar and ice nucleation efficiency of ash particles was lower compared to ATD particles Figure  3 . Insensitivity of shape factor toward ice nucleation implies that T1 particles were sufficiently irregular that further increase in irregularity e.g., T2 particles does not seem to affect ice nucleating efficiency of ash particles. Experiments with controlled irregular features on the particles would be useful to understand more about the significance of shape factor toward ice nucleation.We observed that crystallographic lattice structure properties are more important than surface elemental composition and shape factor toward nucleating ice on ash and dust particles. ATD particles were crystalline and more efficient in nucleating ice, whereas ash particles had some amorphous phase content and reduced ice nucleation efficiency compared to ATD particles. The surface elemental composition shows that both test species consists of several common elements Si, Al, O, Fe, Mg, Na, and Ca . Our results conclude that ash particles from the E16 volcanic event were poor IN compared to ATD particles in deposition mode. XRD measurements show that ash particles lacked the necessary crystalline structure, providing unique insight on importance of crystalline structure toward nucleating ice.For future studies, determining ice nucleation efficiencies of volcanic ash particles from different eruption periods e.g., explosive and phreatomagmatic would be useful to understand the impact of volcanic particles on clouds. In this study, we applied the XRD technique that helped us to interpret heterogeneous ice nucleation efficiencies of ash and dust particles. Future experiments are underway to characterize the effect of acid treatment on the crystallographic properties, as well as quantify the phases and amorphous content using the Rietveld method to advance our overall understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation."
23,dust,"Crystallization and immersion freezing ability of oxalic and succinic acid in multicomponent aqueous organic aerosol particles. This study reports on heterogeneous ice nucleation efficiency of immersed oxalic and succinic acid crystals in the temperature range from 245 to 215K, as investigated with expansion cooling experiments using suspended particles. In contrast to previous laboratory work with emulsified solution droplets where the precipitation of solid inclusions required a preceding freezing/evaporation cycle, we show that immersed solids readily form by homogeneous crystallization within aqueous solution droplets of multicomponent organic mixtures, which have noneutonic compositions with an excess of oxalic or succinic acid. Whereas succinic acid crystals did not act as heterogeneous ice nuclei, immersion freezing by oxalic acid dihydrate crystals led to a reduction of the ice saturation ratio at freezing onset by 0.066-0.072 compared to homogeneous freezing, which is by a factor of 2 higher than previously reported laboratory data. These observations emphasize the importance of oxalic acid in heterogeneous ice nucleation. Several recent studies with laboratory-generated and field-collected samples suggest that apart from insoluble inorganic aerosol particles like mineral dust, also organic rich particles are able to act as heterogeneous nuclei for ice cloud formation in the atmosphere. These organic aerosol particles might be present as crystalline solids or as amorphous noncrystalline species like glasses. Depending on their mixing state, they might promote heterogeneous ice formation via deposition nucleation, where water vapor would directly nucleate onto the bare organic surface, or via immersion freezing, which can take place when the organic solid is embedded as a nucleus in an aqueous solution droplet.The present study investigates the immersion freezing ability of oxalic acid OA and succinic acid SA . These compounds belong to the class of low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids that contribute up to 10% to the total particulate carbon mass concentration of the atmospheric aerosol in certain environments, with oxalic acid being the most abundant species. Immersion freezing represents a major ice nucleation pathway given that these compounds will presumably be part of a multicomponent aqueous mixture.The deliquescence relative humidity DRH of multicomponent organic aerosol particles can be significantly lower than that of the pure compounds. The eutonic mixture of the five highly water soluble dicarboxylic acids malic, malonic, maleic, glutaric, and methylsuccinic acid M5 , e.g., has a DRH of 45.4% relative humidity RH at room temperature whereas the lowest DRH of the single constituents is 72.4% RH. Due to the depression of the DRH, such aqueous M5 aerosol particles can remain entirely liquid over a wide range of humidity conditions and can therefore only homogeneously nucleate ice at elevated ice supersaturation levels. This behavior changes when the less water soluble compounds oxalic or succinic acid are added to the multicomponent mixture as a sixth dicarboxylic acid. The DRH of OA and SA at 298 K is 97.8 and 99.1% RH, respectively. The eutonic compositions of M5 plus OA or SA only include mole fractions of 0.024 or 0.013 of the sixth compound, respectively. Single-particle mass spectrometric measurements revealed a high abundance of oxalate-rich particles in the middle and upper troposphere, with up to 1% and 0.1% of the particles having a more than 5% and 20% contribution of the oxalate mass 89 to the total ion signal, respectively. Therefore, noneutonic compositions with an excess of OA and SA should be considered as well. Here the relative humidity for complete deliquescence of all components of the mixture increases to values above 90% for OA and SA mole fractions larger than 0.2. In such mixtures, a crystalline core of OA or SA can therefore be present at typical tropospheric relative humidities and can act as a heterogeneous ice nucleus.The immersion freezing potential of several low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids has been probed in freezing experiments with emulsified solutions. It was found that only oxalic acid, presumably precipitated in the form of oxalic acid dihydrate OAD , promotes immersion freezing before reaching the homogeneous freezing threshold. On the water activity scale, the difference between the homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing thresholds was 0.02 for temperatures between 240 and 210 K. In ice nucleation experiments with suspended particles in the AIDA Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere cloud chamber, a slightly higher difference of 0.04 was found for OAD immersed in aqueous NaCl solution droplets at 232 K.Besides determining the onset conditions for heterogeneous freezing, it is important to elucidate which pathways might lead to the formation of these solid inclusions. In the emulsion freezing experiments by, it was shown that preceding homogeneous freezing cycles with initially entirely liquid droplets led to the precipitation of OAD. The mechanism behind this process is, however, unclear. It could be related to a heterogeneous effect, meaning that the surface of the nucleated ice crystals triggered the crystallization of OAD. Immersion freezing by OAD in the atmosphere could then only be observed in air masses which were already beforehand involved in ice formation. On the other hand, one must consider that the emulsions were prepared from dilute aqueous solutions. During the freezing experiments, the droplets in the emulsion were not exposed to the ambient relative humidity, meaning that their composition remained constant during cooling until the homogeneous freezing threshold was reached. Then, the solutions were “freeze concentrated,” so that their water activity was equal to that of ice at the freezing temperature. The formation of OAD could therefore also be due to homogeneous crystallization in the freeze-concentrated droplets in the emulsion. This would imply that even without a preceding ice nucleation event, OAD could crystallize in aqueous solution droplets which are directly exposed to the ambient relative humidity at low temperatures.To answer this question, crystallization and freezing experiments with suspended particles have to be performed. In the present letter, we summarize AIDA expansion cooling experiments with suspended, aqueous solution droplets of M5 plus oxalic or succinic acid in the temperature range from 245 to 215 K. As a reference, we have confirmed that aqueous M5 solution droplets without OA or SA nucleated ice at the well-established supersaturation thresholds for homogeneous freezing. We have then probed droplets of selected noneutonic M5 + OA and M5 + SA compositions to gain new insight into the crystallization behavior of OA and SA in such multicomponent organic mixtures and their impact on ice formation.The AIDA chamber consists of a 84 m 3 sized, cylindrical aluminum vessel that is housed in a thermally insulated containment. The chamber can be operated at temperatures down to 183 K, and its pressure can be controlled between ambient and 0.01 hPa by a mechanical pump system located underneath the vessel. The controlled reduction of the chamber pressure, typically from 1000 to 800 hPa, represents an expansion cooling experiment by which ice-supersaturated conditions can be achieved in the chamber. Variable pumping speeds allow for establishing cooling rates between 4 and 0.1 K min −1 . A typical experiment from the present study involves the following steps: The eutonic composition of the five component organic mixture M5 is 16.7 wt % malic acid Merck, ≥ 99.5% , 28.5 wt % malonic acid Merck Schuchardt, ≥ 99% , 11.4 wt % maleic acid Merck Schuchardt, ≥ 99% , 30.2 wt % glutaric acid Merck Schuchardt, ≥ 99% , and 13.3 wt % methylsuccinic acid Sigma Aldrich, 99% . A dilute aqueous solution of 4 wt % M5 of the above composition was used for the aerosol generation in the pure M5 experiments. Two noneutonic M5 + OA solutions with OA mole fractions,, the E-AIM predicts relative humidities of 89, 91, and 94% for full deliquescence in the M5 + OA indicate that this could happen for M5 mass fractions > 70 wt %. As explained in section 3 , however, neither the depolarization records nor the ice nucleation behavior of M5 give any indication that such crystallization has actually taken place. We do not expect that the particles are transformed into a glassy state in our investigated temperature range. The glass transition temperature of aqueous M5 particles is about 191 K at ice-saturated conditions. Furthermore, both the molar masses of oxalic and succinic acid are smaller than the mean molar mass of the M5 acids, which should further decrease the glass transition temperature for the M5 + OA and M5 + SA mixtures.The nucleation of ice during the expansion cooling experiments is detected in different particle size ranges with two optical particle counters OPC1 and OPC2, type WELAS 2000, Palas GmbH . The micron-sized, nucleated ice crystals are separated by an optical threshold size from the smaller-sized seed aerosol particles, so that the ice particle number concentration can be counted independently with an estimated accuracy of ±20%. Occasionally, minor nucleation modes with ice particle number concentrations,, showing that only oxalic but not succinic acid is effective as an immersion freezing nucleus.A graphical representation of the deduced temperature-dependent ice supersaturation thresholds is shown in Figure  2 top . Experiments where heterogeneous freezing was observed are marked by the red circles, whereas the homogeneous freezing onsets are depicted by the black squares. The error bars reflect the 5% uncertainty in the water vapor measurements by the tunable diode laser system. As explained in section 2 , the small differences between the homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing onsets are significant because of the high water vapor sensitivity of the measurement. We compare our data with the water activity-based theory that was used to parameterize the results from the emulsion freezing experiments with oxalic acid. Here the temperature-dependent ice saturation ratios for the nucleation onset are obtained by evaluating where a w ice is the water activity on the ice melting point curve and Δ in the case of mineral dust, might reach water saturation and form water clouds at temperatures above 0°C where precipitated OAD crystallites will presumably dissolve. Upon further lifting and cooling, the trajectory might reach the homogenous ice freezing limit where, as discussed by, OAD could then precipitate from the freeze-concentrated solution upon ice formation and act as a heterogeneous ice nucleus only in a succeeding ice nucleation event. A nonnegligible part of the trajectories, however, reached water saturation in the mixed-phase cloud temperature regime. Here similar to the trajectory of AIDA expansion run B in Figure  1 b, OAD crystallites in the particles could act as immersion freezing ice nuclei to glaciate the cloud of supercooled water droplets even before reaching the homogeneous freezing limit and therefore be active already in the first ice nucleation event. With our current knowledge, the atmospheric implication of the heterogeneous OAD ice nucleation pathways is still hard to quantify.The potential importance of OAD in heterogeneous ice nucleation is corroborated by the fact that this compound is prone to a variety of freezing mechanisms. Apart from immersion freezing, pure crystals or coating layers of OAD are also susceptive to deposition mode ice nucleation and can be preactivated by temperature cycling to yield high-temperature ice nuclei. The reason for its particular ice nucleation ability among other low-soluble dicarboxylic acids like succinic acid remains unclear. One might speculate, however, that the two molecules of water incorporated in crystalline OAD are favorable ice-active sites, recalling recent evidence that the heterogeneous ice nucleation ability of sodium chloride dihydrate is superior to that of anhydrous sodium chloride."
24,dust impact aerosol,"Can we use surface wind fields from meteorological reanalyses for Sahelian dust emission simulations?. The Sahel is prone to intense soil erosion, and the dust emission flux is very sensitive to the surface wind speed. In this study, we use high-frequency observations acquired across the Sahel to assess the ability of three global reanalyses ERA-interim, NCEP-CFSR and MERRA to capture the observed surface wind events that are critical to wind erosion. ERA-Interim is shown to perform best. However, all three reanalyses present a too flat annual cycle, with important season-dependent biases: they overestimate the surface wind during dry season nights and underestimate it during spring and monsoon season days. More importantly, the strongest wind speeds, observed in the morning and during deep convective events, are systematically underestimated. As analyzed wind fields are one of the main inputs of many dust emission models, their too low fraction of high wind speeds will lead to major errors in dust emission simulations. Wind erosion over North Africa is responsible for 25 to 50% of the global emissions of mineral dust. These emissions affect the climate due to their radiative impact, which still remains a significant source of uncertainty in climate projections.In the Sahel, wind erosion is a crucial issue for people and the local economy, which heavily depends on agriculture. As upper soil layers contain most of the nutrients needed for plant growth, erosion lead to a significant midterm loss of soil fertility and productivity.Wind erosion also generates strong dust emission. Consequently, atmospheric concentrations of particulate matter less than 10 μm PM 10 frequently reach very high values, up to several thousands of μg m −3 , far above the World Health Organization quality standards daily mean less than 50 μg m −3 . High PM 10 concentrations have numerous undesired consequences on human health and have been related to meningitis in the Sahel.Quantifying the amount of dust uplifted by the wind is therefore an issue of particular importance. It has been shown that the dust emission flux varies with the cube of the surface friction velocity above a threshold which depends on soil surface characteristics.In West Africa, dust emission events are mainly related to two meteorological processes leading to high surface wind speeds: turbulent mixing of the nocturnal low-level jet LLJ and gust fronts induced by convective cold pools. Typically, a significant fraction of the dust uplift occurs during isolated events which generate violent cold pool outflows caused by moist deep convection cf. results from observations over the Sahel and Sahara or from a model .Meteorological reanalyses are well suited to capture synoptic-scale dynamical processes, but biases in surface wind speeds can be induced through conceptual limitations. First, because of their physical parameterizations, density currents resulting from deep convection enhance the surface wind speed and are not parameterized in atmospheric models like those used for meteorological reanalyses. Second, their coarse resolution and time sampling is not well adapted to transient strong wind events occurring at the mesoscale and generating a large subgrid scale variability. Several recent studies, based on cases studies, have indeed pointed out or suggested some misrepresentations of the wind in reanalyses. As dust emission fluxes are directly linked to the surface wind speed, they are particularly sensitive to the wind fields; the estimated fluxes can vary by a factor of 3 when using wind fields from different reanalyses. These results lead to a growing concern on the use of reanalyses to simulate Sahelian dust emissions, but a systematic evaluation of this issue is still lacking.In the meantime, meteorological reanalyses are more and more commonly used as input fields for dust emission simulations over North Africa, because they use a homogeneous forecasting system for long time periods typically 30 to 50 years , making them the most suitable products for the purpose of long-term studies and simulations.The present study investigates the ability of several reanalyses to represent the previously described processes, in order to point out potential deficiencies. To this purpose, several years of high-frequency wind observations acquired at different locations across the Sahel are used to examine the performances of three global reanalyses.We use the following reanalyses: ERA-Interim European Re-Analysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF ; NCEP-CFSR National Centers for Environmental Prediction's Climate Forecast System Reanalysis from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA ; MERRA Modern Era Retrospective for Research and Applications from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.The 10 m wind speed is available every 3 h for ERA-Interim and every hour for NCEP-CFSR and MERRA. This time resolution allows to capture the LLJ breakdown which occurs in the morning. The spatial resolutions are about 80 km × 80 km, 38 km ×38 km, and 55 km ×70 km for ERA-Interim, NCEP-CFSR, and MERRA, respectively see supporting information SI Appendix SA , for more information .We also use observations from the network of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses AMMA program and focus on four measurement sites chosen to sample the climatology of the surface wind speed in the Sahel, covering an area of about 1000 km × 400 km SI Figure SA1 . These observations were collected over 5 years or more in Cinzana Mali , 13.28°N, 5.93°W, at 2.3 m above ground, and Banizoumbou Niger , 13.54°N, 2.66°E, at 6.5 m as part of the AMMA Sahelian Dust Transect SDT ; Agoufou Mali , 15.34°N, 1.48°W, and Bamba Mali , 17.1°N, 1.4°W, at 3 m at both sites as part of the AMMA-Couplage de l'Atmosphère Tropicale et du Cycle Hydrologique CATCH network in Mali. See more details in SI Appendix SA .A 15 min average is applied to the observed wind speed time series acquired at higher frequency to match typical analysis time step. All wind speed measurements are extrapolated to 10 m assuming a logarithmic profile. This accounts for a maximum bias of less than 0.5 m s −1 in strongly stable cases see SI Appendix SB . Following, surface roughness lengths are estimated from the ratio of the wind speed to friction velocity measured using the eddy correlation technique at Agoufou and Bamba, where turbulence observations are available. Otherwise, we use values from ERA-Interim. Estimated annual-averaged surface roughness lengths are 0.001 m at the northern bare soil site of Bamba, 0.05 m at Agoufou, 0.18 m at Banizoumbou, and 0.23 m at the southwestern vegetated site of Cinzana.For comparison between observations and reanalyses, we use at each site the closest reanalysis grid point results are similar with a distance-weighted interpolation of the four nearest grid points and a 3-hourly subsampling of the 15 min running-average observed wind speeds time series. Since the wind in reanalysis is computed at a resolution of several tens of kilometers, a perfect match with local observation is not expected because local characteristics may impact the comparison with a large-scale model. Consequently, we limit our analysis to systematic biases emerging from comparisons at all the observational sites on long time series. We analyze in particular statistics from diurnal to seasonal timescales with Taylor diagrams, using daily mean wind speed and its 3-hourly fluctuations around the mean.The wind speed probability density function PDF is investigated in order to evaluate the fraction of high wind speeds. Focus is put on convective events, detected using two complementary criteria. The first consists in defining the occurrence of convection when precipitation is locally recorded. The associated convective event is extended to the 30 min before the first rain and the 30 min following the last rain. The second is based on the satellite-based tracking of Mesoscale Convective Systems MCSs of. In the following, a convective event is defined whenever one of the two criteria is met.Finally, we attempt to quantify the influence of the wind fields on the dust emission fluxes and compute a Dust Uplift Potential DUP as proposed by. DUP is proportional to the dust emission flux if the effects of stability, soil moisture, and roughness variations are neglected: where and and follows the well-known Sahelian climatological alternance between the dry and northeasterly Harmattan wind and the moist and southwesterly monsoon wind.Time series of the 10 m wind speed in 2006 at Banizoumbou. a Annual cycle of the 5 day running mean. Vertical dashed lines indicate when the zoomed time series of Figures  1 b and 1 c are taken. Nine day time series in the b monsoon and c dry seasons. Black: 5 min observations; red: ERA-Interim; blue: NCEP-CFSR; green: MERRA; yellow: 3-hourly sampling of a 15 min running mean of the observations. Orange: occurrence of MCSs. The grey shading in Figure  1 a shows the range of minimum and maximum observed values over 2006–2011.The three reanalyses display rather different features of this annual cycle with mean annual biases of 0.27 m s −1 for ERA-Interim, 0.70 m s −1 for MERRA, and −0.62 m s −1 for NCEP-CFSR, with the estimated values of surface roughness lengths. These mean annual biases involve much larger season-dependent biases that are qualitatively shared by the three reanalyses.During the monsoon season, observed high-frequency winds Figure  1 b exhibit large day-to-day fluctuations, and a few sporadic very high 10 m wind speeds related to the occurrence of convective events. The three reanalyses are close to each other and follow the observed synoptic fluctuations. However, they systematically miss the high wind speeds associated with deep convection. This increase of the wind speed due to convective events is still evident from the 3 h subsampled observations yellow curve in Figure  1 , which points to the misrepresentation of convectively driven high wind speeds in the reanalyses, beyond their too coarse time sampling. In the three reanalyses, the wind speed always tends to be lower than observed see SI Appendix SD and Figure SD1 for statistics . This highlights uncertainties in the processes controlling wind speed that could involve the representation of the large-scale dynamics or the daytime boundary layer mixing in the reanalyses. NCEP-CFSR behaves worst and largely underestimates wind speeds, which is consistent with previous studies.During the dry season, observations Figure  1 c indicate a strong influence of the diurnal cycle on the 10 m wind speed. It is very low during nighttime, sharply increases in the morning, and then slowly decreases throughout the afternoon. In MERRA and ERA-Interim, the wind speed tends to be significantly stronger than observed Figures  1 a and 1 c . This seasonal bias arises from a systematic overestimation of the nighttime wind speed which is also shared by NCEP-CFSR, as discussed in section  3.2 .The combination of these two season-dependent biases lead to an unrealistically flat amplitude of the annual cycle of the surface wind speed, in the three reanalyses. It is much too weak in NCEP-CFSR 2.37 m s −1 against 4.30 m s −1 for the observations on average over the four sites . MERRA and ERA-Interim present a larger amplitude of the annual cycle, with a progressive decrease of the surface wind speed during the monsoon, as observed, but still a too smooth annual cycle with an annual amplitude of 4.10 and 3.48 m s −1 , respectively .During the dry season, low-level dynamics are strongly controlled by boundary layer processes and nighttime surface wind speeds are very low at all sites Figures  2 c, 2 f, 2 i, and 2 l , due to the atmospheric stability that inhibits turbulence. In all reanalyses, nighttime 10 m wind speeds are systematically overestimated Figures  1 c, 2 c, 2 f, 2 i, and 2 l , which accounts for the strong positive biases in ERA-Interim and MERRA during the dry season Figure  1 a . MERRA wind speeds are so unrealistically high during winter nights that the diurnal cycle is almost reversed Figure  1 c . NCEP-CFSR is characterized by an unrealistically weak diurnal amplitude, which leads to a reasonable estimation of the diurnal-averaged wind speed Figure  1 a via two compensating errors: a too high wind speed at night and a too low wind speed during the day. The nighttime overestimation of wind speed, found in all reanalyses, is consistent with an overestimation of the turbulent diffusion in the nighttime dry stable surface layer. Nocturnal diffusion is indeed artificially enhanced in models for practical considerations. This induces a too strong mixing with the LLJ often present at a typical altitude of 300 m above the ground and therefore leads to an overestimation of the surface wind speed.Monthly mean diurnal cycles of mean and extreme 10 m wind speeds at four sites for a, d, g, and j May, b, e, h, and k August, and c, f, i, and l December 2006. Observational for ERA-Interim, and/or some misrepresentation of the mixing rate.Other sporadic wind maxima related with convective events occur, during the spring and monsoon months, as illustrated by the minimum-maximum envelope in Figure  2 ; this envelope is indicated by grey shading and convection by the orange line . These extreme winds associated with convection are totally missing in reanalyses.In reanalyses, whatever the season, the diurnal amplitude and the monthly variability tend to be underestimated. This mainly results from the underestimation of the daytime wind speed during the monsoon season, and from the overestimation of the nighttime wind speed during the dry season.A comparison of statistics is made on Taylor diagrams Figure  3 . During both seasons, synoptic and intraseasonal fluctuations are captured by the three reanalyses. Correlation coefficients between observed and analyzed daily mean wind are higher than 0.5–0.6 Figures  3 a and 3 b , but this is associated with a too low standard deviation in ERA-Interim and NCEP-CFSR underestimated by 13 to 54% . Mean biases of the daily mean wind speed are significant in the three reanalyses, up to 2 m s −1 in dry season and −2 m s −1 during monsoon see SI Appendix SD and Figure SD1 right column . The performance of the reanalyses drops sharply at subdaily time scale Figures  3 c and 3 d , leading to higher normalized root-mean-square deviations nRMSD and smaller correlation coefficients. This means that the misrepresentation largely comes from biases in the diurnal cycle.Normalized Taylor diagrams synthesizing normalized standard deviations σ ~ rea , correlation coefficients, and normalized root-mean-square deviations nRMSD of the 10 m wind speed from reanalyses compared to observations for the 2006–2011 period. The observational references are shown with the black dots.

It also gives reasonable but slightly underestimated standard deviations. MERRA gives good estimates of the standard deviation but displays a strong positive bias and a negative correlation with observation at subdaily timescales in dry season. NCEP-CFSR has a reasonable correlation with observation at synoptic timescale but much too weak variability and diurnal cycle amplitude.The 10 m wind speed PDF is computed for the whole monsoon period, during which most convective events happen cf. Figure  4 for Banizoumbou, SI Appendix SF for the other sites in 2006, and Appendix SG for other years . top Probability density functions PDF of 10 m wind speed in Banizoumbou during the monsoon season from May to September of 2006: observations black and ERA-Interim red ; or during convective events only: observations grey and ERA-Interim orange . bottom Accumulated Dust Uplift Potential DUP ¯ in Banizoumbou over the whole year 2006 red: ERA-Interim; black: observations .

When using a typical value of and.These two last points are responsible for large differences in the probability density functions of surface wind speeds, especially at extreme values >7 m s −1 , which is critical in terms of dust emissions. Indeed, quantifications of the DUP show that the use of the ERA-Interim 10  m wind speed for that purpose can lead to an underestimation of the DUP by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.Therefore, if one wants to use these reanalyses fields as forcing for dust emission models in the Sahel, it appears crucial to first apply a correction to the winds in order to take into account the effect of convection on wind-driven dust emissions. The magnitude of the LLJ should also be corrected since the wind associated to this pattern often reaches the uplift threshold in the northern Sahel. Moreover, this study highlights some processes that are missing in the atmospheric models used for meteorological reanalyses, and long-term efforts are and should be undertaken to improve the representation of the surface wind dynamics at turbulent and mesoscales."
25,dust climate,"The fertilizing role of African dust in the Amazon rainforest: A first multiyear assessment based on data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations. The productivity of the Amazon rainforest is constrained by the availability of nutrients, in particular phosphorus P . Deposition of long-range transported African dust is recognized as a potentially important but poorly quantified source of phosphorus. This study provides a first multiyear satellite-based estimate of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin using three-dimensional 3-D aerosol measurements over 2007-2013 from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization CALIOP . The 7year average of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin is estimated to be 28 8-48 Tga -1 or 29 8-50 kgha -1 a -1 . The dust deposition shows significant interannual variation that is negatively correlated with the prior-year rainfall in the Sahel. The CALIOP-based multiyear mean estimate of dust deposition matches better with estimates from in situ measurements and model simulations than a previous satellite-based estimate does. The closer agreement benefits from a more realistic geographic definition of the Amazon Basin and inclusion of meridional dust transport calculation in addition to the 3-D nature of CALIOP aerosol measurements. The imported dust could provide about 0.022 0.006-0.037 TgP of phosphorus per year, equivalent to 23 7-39 gPha -1 a -1 to fertilize the Amazon rainforest. This out-of-basin phosphorus input is comparable to the hydrological loss of phosphorus from the basin, suggesting an important role of African dust in preventing phosphorus depletion on timescales of decades to centuries. The Amazon rainforest represents about half of the planet's remaining rainforests and is an important ecosystem that plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate. Relatively small changes in the forest cover and productivity could have important implications for the carbon cycle, atmospheric circulations, the hydrology cycle, and climate from regional to global scales. Phosphorus P is the principal fertility factor influencing tree growth across the Amazon Basin. However, 90% of soils in the Amazon Basin are P deficient. It has been suggested that long-term productivity of the Amazon rainforest depends highly on the atmospheric deposition of dust that may come from a distant ecosystem such as the Saharan desert. Although the presence of African dust in the Amazon Basin has long been observed, the dust deposition and associated P input are not yet well quantified. Recently, advanced satellite observations with routine sampling and large spatial and temporal coverage have become ideal for quantifying the intercontinental transport and deposition of aerosol. Substantial discrepancies still exist between measurements and models.Factors contributing to the large discrepancies in the dust deposition are not fully understood or at least not adequately accounted for. There are several possible reasons for the large range of discrepancy between the different estimates of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin. First, each individual estimate is subject to specific uncertainties, some large. In addition, the intercomparisons have often been complicated by issues such as differences in geographical definition of the Amazon Basin, year of the assessment, and inclusion or exclusion of meridional transport.The main objective of this study is to resolve the previous discrepancies and provide an alternative satellite-based estimate of dust deposition and phosphorus input into the Amazon Basin. We base our estimate on 3-D distributions of aerosols from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization CALIOP onboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations CALIPSO from 2007 to 2013. Since June 2006, CALIOP has been measuring 3-D distributions of backscatter, extinction, and depolarization ratio of both clear-sky aerosol and above-cloud aerosol over nearly global scale. The previous standard for satellite estimates of dust deposition used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS that provides only a two-dimensional view of the transport. By using 3-D measurements from CALIOP, the MODIS uncertainties can be reassessed or reduced. Another improvement over the single-year study of . On a basis of a 7 year average, the best estimate of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin amounts to 28 Tg for DJF and MAM combined. b Correlation of CALIOP-estimated DJF + MAM total dust import to, export from, and deposition into the Amazon Basin with prior-year Sahel Precipitation Index SPI . c Correlation of CALIOP-estimated seasonal dust mass flux in zonal direction into the Amazon Basin with PM 10 concentration measured at Cayenne 4.95°N, 52.31°W , French Guiana, over the period of 2007–2011.The interannual variation of dust deposition is generally regulated by variations in African dust emissions, atmospheric circulations, and rainfall along the dust transport route. .A comparison of annual dust deposition between the CALIOP-based estimate and those in the literature as well as GOCART and Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry WRF-Chem simulations is summarized in Table  2 . We calculate the GOCART and WRF-Chem dust deposition into the same region as defined in Figure  1 . Apparently, the CALIOP-based estimate of 28 8–48  Tg falls in between the MODIS-based estimate of 50 Tg and those estimated from in situ observations and model simulations 13–26 Tg . However, the apparent discrepancies shown in the table should not be attributed to the uncertainties associated with individual methods or data, because such a comparison is complicated by differences in regions and years among the studies see notes in the table .Swap et al .Ridley et al .We use the correlation between dust deposition and SPI Figure  2 b to extrapolate the CALIOP-derived values back to the same years as previous studies listed in Table  2 . The SPI values for 1986 a year prior to the in situ observation in Swap et al . and 2000 a year prior to the MODIS estimate in Kaufman et al . are −2.04 and −1.25, respectively. Applying the regression equation from Figure  2 b, the dust depositions would have been 32 and 30 Tg in 1987 and 2001, respectively. These extrapolated values decrease the discrepancy between MODIS and CALIOP by only 9% and increase the discrepancy between the in situ estimate and CALIOP by 27%. Differences in years cannot explain the discrepancies in studies.Can the definition of the Amazon Basin and the exclusion of meridional transport in Kaufman et al . explain the discrepancy in dust deposition? The estimate by Kaufman et al . was made in a region of. On a basis of the 7 year average applied to the rectangular domain defined in Kaufman et al ., the CALIOP-derived net dust transport in the zonal direction alone is 49 Tg, which is nearly the same as the estimate of 50 Tg by Kaufman et al .. We also found that the CALIOP-derived meridional transport adds an additional 24 Tg of dust into the domain of Kaufman et al .. Thus, the total dust deposition, calculated from CALIOP, in the domain of Kaufman et al . amounts to 73 Tg, which is 160% larger than the 28 Tg estimated for the domain defined in Figure  1 . The above practice underscores the importance of appropriately defining the basin and including the meridional transport. Improper assumptions, as per Kaufman et al ., will overestimate the dust deposition, which could explain a significant portion of the discrepancies documented in literature.In summary, the CALIOP-based estimate of dust deposition shows a better agreement with in situ measurements and model simulations than the MODIS-based estimate as reported in literature. The closer agreement benefits from a more realistic geographic definition of the Amazon Basin and an inclusion of meridional dust transport, in addition to the 3-D nature of CALIOP measurements.Micronutrients such as phosphorus, carried by African dust, can have important implications for the biogeochemical cycle in the Amazon Basin. To estimate the amount of phosphorous associated with the dust deposition of 28 8–48  Tg a −1 , we must obtain the mass concentration of phosphorus in the dust C PD . Observations at the Bodele depression yielded a C PD of 780 ppm, while those at Barbados and Miami gave a higher C PD of 880 ppm. Mahowald et al . used C PD of 720 ppm in their global model simulation. By using C PD of 780 ppm, we estimate that on the basis of a 7 year average, yearly total P deposition into the Amazon Basin mounts to 0.022 0.006–0.037  Tg P a −1 or equivalent to 23 7–39  g P ha −1  a −1 . Given that the dust deposition is highly heterogeneous, phosphorus deposition should be substantially higher in the central Amazon Basin where most of dust deposition is expected. For comparison, Swap et al . estimated a range of 11–47 g P ha −1  a −1 in a much smaller study area of the central Amazon Basin. Note that our estimated P deposition is subjected to uncertainty associated with C PD . It is possible that C PD may have changed during the long-range transport. The issue could be investigated in the future by extracting dust and associated P from accumulating aerosol measurements in the Amazon Basin.How significant is the P input associated with African dust in the context of the phosphorus cycle in the basin? Vitousek and Sanford summarized that the recycling of phosphorus through litterfall is 1400–4100 g P ha −1  a −1 in the Amazon Basin, which is 61–178 fold of our best estimate of phosphorus input associated with dust deposition. The total atmospheric deposition resulting from dust and nondust sources was estimated to be 161–300 g P ha −1  a −1 . Our estimated P deposition associated with dust accounts for no more than 13% of the total atmospheric deposition. Primarily, biogenic aerosols and biomass burning smoke are thought to contribute the remaining atmospheric phosphorus deposition. Therefore, the phosphorus associated with the dust is relatively small as compared with the recycling and the deposition of biogenic and smoke particles. On the other hand, our estimated phosphorus input associated with African dust is comparable to the estimated hydrological loss of 8–40 g P ha −1  a −1 . This suggests that African dust may have important implication for maintaining the health of Amazon rainforests over the long term. Without the phosphorus input from African dust, the hydrological loss would greatly deplete the soil phosphorus reservoir over a timescale of decades or centuries and affect the health and productivity of the Amazon rainforest.Finally, we would like to note that the amount of dust needed to provide adequate phosphorus for maintaining the productivity of the Amazon rainforest remains unknown. To quantify the amount, we require a much better understanding of all major components of the phosphorus cycle including the recycling through litterfall, atmospheric deposition of dust, smoke, and biological particles, and hydrological loss . Currently, our knowledge does not warrant a claim with high level of confidence that there exists a missing source of phosphorus for the Amazon Basin on the order of 50 Tg a −1 of African dust as claimed by Kaufman et al . or Ridley et al ..This study provides the first multiyear satellite-based estimate of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin. We have estimated from the three-dimensional aerosol distribution derived from the CALIOP 7 year 2007–2013 record that on average 28 8–48  Tg a −1 or 29 8–50  kg ha −1  a −1 of dust is deposited into the Amazon Basin during the wet season e.g., boreal winter and spring . On a seasonal basis, the estimated dust import to the Amazon Basin is well correlated with surface aerosol measurements during 2007–2011 in Cayenne, French Guiana. The dust deposition shows interannual variation of up to 29%, which is negatively correlated with the prior-year rainfall anomaly in the Sahel at the 95% confidence level.The CALIOP-based multiyear mean estimate of dust deposition agrees better with estimates from in situ measurements and model simulations than the MODIS-based estimate does. The closer agreement benefits from a more realistic geographic definition of the Amazon Basin and the inclusion of meridional dust transport, in addition to the 3-D nature of CALIOP aerosol measurements. These factors could explain a significant portion of the large discrepancies between measurements and models as reported in literature.We further estimated that the phosphorus P input associated with the dust deposition is 0.022 0.006–0.037  Tg P a −1 or 23 7–39  g P ha −1  a −1 . Although this phosphorus input originating from outside the basin is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than the atmospheric deposition of smoke and biological particles and the phosphorus recycling via litterfall within the basin, it is comparable to the hydrological loss of phosphorus. This may suggest an important role of African dust in preventing phosphorus depletion on timescales of decades or centuries."
362,dust aerosol,"Near-surface dust flux enrichment in small particles during erosion events. Mineral dust in the atmosphere impacts Earth's radiative budget and biogeochemical cycles. Sorting of dust-sized particles within the first few meters above the soil during wind erosion is still unknown. In particular, the sensitivity of the size distribution of dust flux to wind intensity has been questioned for years. This sensitivity is reanalyzed here using a novel erosion model developed in a turbulent airflow model. Starting from air free of dust, the suspension of small dust 1.5m needs several hours to reach a stationary state against about 20 min for coarser dust > 5m . During this nonstationary phase, a continuous enrichment of the near-surface dust flux in small particles is simulated, enrichment enhanced with wind intensity. This is explained by the lower deposition velocity of small dust particles, a process usually ignored in interpretation of field data but that plays a crucial role in sorting dust particles. Mineral dust in the atmosphere affects the Earth's radiative budget by absorbing and diffusing solar and terrestrial radiation, and indirectly by impacting cloud and precipitation formation. Over a longer timescale, it also affects biogeochemical cycles by adding or removing nutrients to ecosystems. Mineral dust contributes to a large uncertainty on the estimate of the impact of the total radiative forcing on the climate, and existing global dust models still fail to predict accurately dust suspension. Part of model discrepancies rely on the estimation of surface dust emission and deposition fluxes, and their size distribution, and chemical and mineral composition, both affecting dust optical properties.The size distribution of dust emission fluxes and its dependence to wind condition remain controversial. On one hand, the wind tunnel experiments of showed that near-surface dust flux exhibits a significant enrichment in small dust particles with increasing wind speed. They explained it by the enhancement of soil particle disaggregation with wind speed as saltators have more energy to extract small particles. This led who observed a significant enrichment in small dust for the most energetic erosion events although no relationship between size distribution and fluctuations of the friction wind velocity was observed during erosion events. On the other hand, and was due to the nonestablishment of the erosion regime. The approach of provided that the speed of impacting saltators is effectively constant on average.In this study, we reanalyze the dependence of the size distribution of the dust flux to the wind speed for erosion events starting from an air free of dust. To that purpose, we use the most detailed physically based soil erosion model to date to simulate at high-resolution dust emission, transport, and deposition over abare soil for different wind conditions. The novelty of this model is to represent explicitly the main erosion processes saltation, sandblasting, dust suspension within a large eddy simulation airflow model that simulates instantaneous wind and thus turbulent flow eddies and erosion intermittency. This represents the first attempt to simulate the full erosion process in a turbulent flow.The three-dimensional saltation model of is extended to dust suspension. All saltating and dust particles are considered spherical with a diameter.As dust particles are smaller and more numerous than saltating particles, an Eulerian approach is preferred over a Lagrangian one to solve dust dispersal as it would be difficult to explicitly simulate the individual trajectory of a statistically representative number of dust particles. The size distribution of dust particles is divided into, simulations were performed in two steps. The flow dynamic was first solved without saltation and dust suspension. Once the flow dynamic reached an equilibrium state with the soil, then 10,000 initially resolved saltating particles were released randomly within the lower 0.3m depth layer above the surface, and the erosion modules were activated. The diameter of these initial saltating particles was taken randomly from the size distribution of the soil grains. Erosion events of 20 min were simulated.For this study, some simplifications in the dust emission scheme have been made: 1 the cohesion energy. The time-averaged values of see Table  1 . The spatially averaged dust emission flux,. The total dust flux includes the turbulent diffusive flux and the gravitational-settling flux, where obtained from a wind tunnel experiment on a sand surface, values around 5 × 10 −3 , 3 × 10 −2 , and 3 × 10 −2 ms −1 for 1.5, 6.7, and 14.2μm dust, with increasing wind may be partly or totally explained by the non-stationarity of the dust suspension process and by the variability of the deposition velocity with dust diameter and wind speed. A comparison between the predictions of the dust emission model of applied a correction to measured dust flux to account for gravitational settling.Finally, the possible dependency of the size distribution of emitted dust to the wind speed was ignored in this study. This point needs further research to be confirmed.We demonstrated for the first time that in some conditions the suspension of small dust around 1μm can be a long nonstationary process several hours depending on the wind intensity due to the low deposition velocity of this particle size range. This leads to a continuous enrichment of the near-surface dust flux in small particles, enrichment that is enhanced with wind intensity, independently of the possible role of saltators. These results emphasize the importance 1 of accounting for this nonstationary process when analyzing wind tunnel and field measurements, 2 of measuring dust fluxes per size class at high frequency to follow accurately their time variation, and 3 of better quantifying dust deposition velocity in field measurements."
27,aerosol,"Observation of the simultaneous transport of Asian mineral dust aerosols with anthropogenic pollutants using a POPC during a long-lasting dust event in late spring 2014. We observed a long-lasting dust event from 25 May to 2 June 2014, using a polarization optical particle counter POPC . The transport of dust plumes over East Asia was verified on the basis of observations of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, a lidar network, and surface synoptic observation stations. Mixing of dust and anthropogenic pollutants was investigated according to the variation in the depolarization ratio as a function of particle size. The nonsphericity of dust particles varied due to the impact of anthropogenic pollutants on their pathway. In the coarse mode, dust particles always had a clear nonspherical configuration, although large amounts of nitrate were also present. Supermicron particles are occasionally present in a spherical configuration, possibly due to the complex mixing of natural dust and anthropogenic particles. Statistically, similar to 64% of the total nitrate mass was deemed to be transported from outside of Japan due to a trapping effect in the dust plume. In spring, East Asia sporadically experiences severe dust storms that originate from the Taklimakan or Gobi deserts. Mineral dust aerosols can influence the biological productivity of marine ecosystems by supplying nutrients and impacting the formation of high-altitude cirrus clouds and the atmospheric radiative budget. The most prominent characteristic of dust events in East Asia is that the mineral dust source region is in close proximity to a densely populated/polluted industrial area. Dust aerosols can easily mix with anthropogenic pollutants within the planetary boundary layer PBL along their transport pathway, forming so-called “polluted” dust, as a result of direct absorption and condensation processes. Polluted mineral particles in East China reportedly have been involved in atmospheric heterogeneous reactions with acidic gases.Mineral dust aerosols and anthropogenic pollutants can be distinguished according to the depolarization ratio DR of their scattering signals, because the direction of polarization of scattering light was identical with the incident light for spherical particle; however, for the nonspherical particles, the direction of polarization of scattering light will change. In general, anthropogenic aerosols are normally spherical with a small DR, whereas dust aerosols are irregular/nonspherical with a larger DR. Based on this characteristic, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation satellite and a ground-based lidar network were developed to provide the vertical structure and horizontal distribution of pollutants and dust particles at high temporal resolutions. Recently, a polarization optical particle counter POPC: YGK Corporation, Japan was developed to measure the size and polarization ratio of each individual particle. POPC is a powerful tool for investigating the time-resolved mixing state of mineral dust and anthropogenic aerosols. In this study, we focused on a long-lasting dust event and considered the physical properties and extent of mixing of dust plumes with anthropogenic pollutions, as well as possible mechanisms for the formation of polluted dust aerosols.Online observations of the light-polarization properties of a single particle were made using a POPC at Kyushu University 33.5°N, 130.5°E during spring 2014. The instrument was installed in an air-conditioned room, and ambient air was drawn into the room from the roof of a building through an ~3 m long, perpendicularly fixed stainless steel tube. The impact of artifacts in the surrounding environment was negligible due to limited human activity in the area. POPC illuminates linearly polarized laser beam at a wavelength of 780 nm with the polarization direction parallel with the plane of scattering angle PSA , and it measures the intensities of the forward scattering signal, s -polarized perpendicular with respect to the PSA and p -polarized parallel with respect to the PSA backward scattering signals for each individual particle traversing the laser beam. The intensity of forward scattering is used to derive the size of individual particles. The DR, denoted as the ratio of the intensity of the s -polarized signal to the intensity of the backward scattering signal. Supermicron particles with DR > 0.2 and submicron particles with DR > 0.5 were regarded as being “nonspherical” e.g., dust . Supermicron particles with a DR < 0.2 were regarded as having a spherical structure e.g., anthropogenic pollutants or sea salt . Because of the optical instrumentation used in the POPC, the accuracy of the DR for submicron particles is lower than for supermicron particles, and the DR has a small offset value even for spherical particles. It was worth noting that theoretical calculation indicated that DR of spherical supermicron particles generally fluctuated between 0 and 0.1; therefore, the DR = 0.2 in the present study was just a moderate criterion, and more validations using ambient/laboratory observation are still necessary. The mass concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols in both the fine and coarse modes were concurrently measured using a continuous dichotomous aerosol chemical speciation analyzer ACSA-12, Kimoto Electric Co., Ltd., Japan at 1 h time intervals. The ACSA-12 determines particulate matter PM , black carbon BC , sulfate, and nitrate on the basis of the β ray absorption, near-infrared light scattering, BaSO 4 -based turbid metric, and UV spectrophotometric methods, respectively, with an uncertainty of ~10%. The 6 h averaged fine-mode Na concentration was also measured by ion chromatography.A large dust event occurred in the Kyushu area of Japan from 1500 JST 26 May to 1600 JST 2 June 2014. Figure  1 shows the spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth AOD measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS on board the Terra/Aqua satellite. Breakout of the dust storm was first observed on 24 May over the Gobi desert due to a strong surface wind resulting from a low-pressure system L 1 over the eastern Mongolian Plateau. Dust plumes swept over the populated/industrial region of East China and moved to the West Pacific region from 26 May. On 28 May, the dust plumes were observed by almost all of the surface synoptic observation SYNOP stations over the Korean Peninsula and Japan. On 29 May, a high-pressure system formed over the south of Kyushu Island, which trapped the dust plume for ~4 days, resulting in consecutive days with a high-PM concentration due to subsidence of the dust plume. Multiple ground-based lidar observations confirmed that the dust plume extended from the surface up to altitude of ~2 km during almost all of the period supporting information Figure S1 . a–f Movement of dust plumes from 24 May to 31 May 2014, over the East Asia region. The triangular symbols and the circled “L” and “H” characters represent the surface synoptic observation SYNOP stations that observed the occurrence of dust event including WW codes 06 and 07 and the locations of synoptic low- and high-pressure systems, respectively. The color represents the AOD measured by MODIS onboard Terra/Aqua satellite.We classified the whole dust event into four periods according to the emissions, transport patterns, and variations of chemical compounds, as shown in Figure  2 . The first dust plume arrived in the Kyushu area at 1600 JST 26 May, with a maximum mass concentration of 130 µg/m 3 for PM in the coarse mode 2.5 <  D p  < 10 µm, denoted as PM 2.5–10 , and 62.5 µg/m 3 for PM in the fine mode 0 <  D p  < 2.5 µm, PM 2.5 . Mass concentrations of nitrate in both the fine and coarse modes were also elevated, with means of 1.8 µg/m 3 and 3.2 µg/m 3 , respectively, which were almost 3 times the levels in nondust periods. Lidar observations at Nagasaki 32.94°N, 129.98°E indicated that the dust plume was transported below an altitude of 1 km. We denoted this period as “D1.” The second dust plume influenced the Kyushu area from 1900 local standard time LST 27 May to 0000 LST 29 May. The vertical structure of the dust extinction coefficient determined by lidar indicated that the dust plumes had a layered structure before arrival Figure  2 c . The dust plume in the lower altitude first arrived at the site at midnight on 28 May and contained a substantial amount of coarse-mode nitrate 6.6 µg/m 3 , as shown in Figure  2 b . The dust plume in the high altitude 1.5 km descended and became well mixed within the PBL on the afternoon of 28 May. The mass concentration of PM 2.5–10 in the PBL reached a maximum 152.4 µg/m 3 due to subsidence of the dust plume. The influence from sea salt was negligible, as confirmed by the low mass concentration of sodium 0.05 µg/m 3 . We denoted this period as “D2.” On 29 May, the mass concentration of nitrate, sulfate, and sodium in the fine mode increased significantly to 6.2, 14.8 the maxima during the dust event , and 0.28 µg/m 3 , respectively. The mass concentration of nitrate in the coarse mode was not clearly enhanced. A 5 day back trajectory supporting information Figure S2 implied that the air masses were affected by both anthropogenic pollution in East China and emissions of sea salt. We denoted this period as “D3.” The remaining period from 30 May to 2 June was denoted as “D4.” Due to the influence of the high-pressure system over the Kyushu area, the apparent subsidence of the air mass brought the dust plume to the surface with the development of the PBL in the afternoon Figure  2 c , resulting in a clear diurnal variation in the mass concentration of PM 2.5–10 Figure  2 a . The mass concentration of nitrate in the coarse mode gradually decreased from 5.5 to 1.6 µg/m 3 due to gravitational settling. The mass concentration of sodium was 0.15 µg/m 3 on average. Figure  2 d describes the temporal variation in the d V /dlog D p of particles from 25 May to 9 June, and the circles in the plot represent the mode volume diameter MVD calculated for particles with a diameter > 1 µm at 2 h intervals. The MVD was clearly high, with a distinct peak above 7.5 µm when pure dust plumes intruded and tended to decrease gradually due to the rapid deposition of larger dust particles. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in D4.Time series of the mass concentrations of PM 2.5 , PM 2.5–10 , and a fine-mode sodium, b mass concentrations of nitrate and sulfate ions in the fine and coarse modes, c vertical distribution of the extinction coefficient of dust particles, and d volume size distribution of particles from 25 May to 9 June 2014. The white circles in Figure  2 d indicate the mode volume diameter MVD of particles.Figure  3 depicts the temporal variations in the DR as a function of particle size during the four dust periods. During nondust periods, the observation site was dominated by spherical particles Figure  3 a . When the dust plumes arrived D1 period , nonspherical particles in the coarse mode increased significantly, with an MVD of 5.2 µm. The total volume of spherical particles in the fine mode was also enhanced Figure  3 b , indicating that anthropogenic pollutants were being transported with the dust. In the subsequent period, the volume concentration of coarse-mode particles decreased by 23% due to the rapid gravitational settling of dust particles Figure  3 c , whereas only minor changes were observed in the volume concentration of fine-mode particles.Variation in the dependence of the depolarization ratio on particle size in four dust periods for a–c period D1, d–f period D2, g–i period D3, and j–l period D4. Color and contour lines represent the d V /dlog D p and volume fraction of particles, respectively.The dust plume during the D2 period had a layered structure Figure  2 c . Substantial amounts of anthropogenic pollutants were found to be present in the dust plume that was transported within the PBL 0000 LST 28 May; Figure  2 b , and they seemed to be already well mixed with dust particles due to the preferential presence of relatively larger spherical particles marked “S1” in Figure  3 d . Dust plumes transported from high altitudes mainly consisted of large nonspherical particles MVD = 6.4 µm in Figure  3 e . The volume fraction of spherical supermicron particles increased at nighttime marked “S2” in Figure  3 f . The impact of sea salt was minor because of the low-sodium concentration and relative humidity.During the D3 period, we observed a large fraction of the fine-mode particles with a spherical structure throughout the day, especially in the morning. The pronounced peak of nitrate mass in fine mode on 0700 LST was mostly responsible for the spherical supermicron particles marked “S3” in Figure  3 g . The presence of spherical supermicron particles “S4” in Figure  3 i seemed to be related to sea salt because of the high-sodium concentration 0.3 µg/m 3 ; Figure  2 a .During the D4 period, a pronounced diurnal variation occurred in the volume concentration of nonspherical dust particles Figure  2 a . Dust particles were dispersed downward to the surface under the influence of the high-pressure system and the development of the PBL in the daytime Figure  2 c , resulting in a significant increase in the volume concentration of coarse-mode nonspherical particles MVD = 6.9 µm in Figure  3 k and a low concentration of large dust particles at nighttime due to rapid deposition in the nocturnal PBL. Spherical particles in the fine mode displayed a clear daytime-low and nighttime-high patterns, mostly due to the variability of the PBL and heterogeneous formation under high-humidity conditions at night. The high-sodium concentration in the spherical supermicron particles “S5” in Figures  3 j and “S6” in Figure  3 l suggested an influence from sea salt.In Figures  3 j S5 and 3 l S6 , the sea salt mode can be clearly distinguished. In Figures  3 d S1 and 3 f S2 , the volume concentration of all supermicron particles less than 10 µm are elevated, and the two peaks of volume concentration at 2 and 5 µm were not completely isolated, unlike in the sea salt mode. This indicates that small dust particles were mixed with anthropogenic pollutants when they left the polluted area in East China and that the air mass contained an internal mixture of dust and pollutants, as suggested by Sugimoto et al .. Field observations using transmission electron microscopy have also shown that mineral dust particles from the North China Plain contain a visible anthropogenic coating. Our results were also supported by a modeling study of a superdust storm in March 2010, which indicated that more than 50% of sulfate, nitrate, and HNO 3 gas could be captured by dust particles due to heterogeneous surface reactions.In this study, nonspherical coarse-mode particles were predominant. Although the mass concentration of nitrate in the coarse mode 3.8 ± 1.6 µg/m 3 was 3 times the level 1.1 ± 0.7 µg/m 3 in the nondust period, they were insufficient to change the nonsphericity of dust particles because of the low fraction ~6% in PM 2.5–10 .Long-term observations in the Kyushu area demonstrated that the nitrate mass in the fine mode could be attributed to local emissions of NO x . Figure  4 shows the day-to-day variations of the mass concentrations of nitrate, NO x , BC an indicator of local emissions , the NO x /BC ratio, and the NO 3 − /NO x ratio during the observation period. Levels of NO x and BC were well correlated R 2  = 0.6 , with a mean NO x /BC ratio of 24 ± 7 during the dust event, which was similar to that during the nondust period 27 ± 8 . This implied that the local emission intensity of NO x did not vary significantly. The ambient mass concentrations of NO 3 − and NO x were well correlated R 2  = 0.3 in the nondust period, with a mean NO 3 − /NO x ratio of 0.12 ± 0.06 ranging between 0.03 and 0.28 . However, in the dust period, the pattern of covariation between NO 3 − and NO x levels disappeared, and the NO 3 − /NO x ratio was 0.4 ± 0.2 on average. Although the heterogeneous reaction of NO 2 with dust particles NO 2  + dust → 0.5 HONO + 0.5 HNO 3 may enhance the production rate of nitrate in the particle phase, it could not explain such a substantial increase in the nitrate mass. Its contribution a few percent, based on the Fuchs and Sutugin equation, and the premise of an NO 2 uptake coefficient of 2.1 × 10 −6 , shown in the supporting information was negligible. On the premise of a positive correlation between the mass of NO x and NO 3 − , ~36% of the nitrate could be attributed to local emissions and the other 64% range = 44%–84% seemed to be related to the transport of dust from outside of Japan, highlighting the significance of such dust plumes as a medium for the long-distance/transboundary transport of pollutants. It also indicates the likelihood of changes occurring in the morphology of dust particles, from nonsphericity to sphericity, during transport.Daily variations in the mass concentrations of total nitrate, black carbon BC , the mixing ratio of NO x , and the NO x /BC and NO3 − /NO x ratios from 10 May to 20 June 2014.A 7 day long dust event occurred in the Kyushu area in late spring 2014. From online measurements using a POPC and ACSA-12, we identified the concurrent transport of mineral dust particles and anthropogenic pollutants such as sulfate and nitrate from outside of Japan. An analysis of the temporal variations of the DR of particles as a function of their size demonstrated that particularly in the fine mode, dust particles were mixed with anthropogenic pollutants. In the aloft dust plume, pure mineral dust particles were dominant. Despite the presence of a substantial nitrate mass in the coarse mode, the nonsphericity of the dust particles was not altered. This study highlighted the fact that processes mixing the dust particles and anthropogenic pollutants were occurring since the dust particles were elevated and implied that a gradual alteration of the morphology of dust particles, from nonspherical to spherical, occurred as they were transported, which would have a pivotal role in their climate forcing effect."
28,dust aerosol atmosphere clouds climate,"Global dust distribution from improved thin dust layer detection using A-train satellite lidar observations. A new dust detection algorithm was developed to take advantage of strong dust signals in the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation CALIPSO 532 nm perpendicular channel to more accurately identify optically thin dust layer boundaries. Layer mean particulate depolarization ratios and improved thin ice cloud detections by combining CALIPSO and CloudSat products were used to further refine the dust mask. Three year global mean results show that the new method detects dust occurrences totaldetecteddustcasenumber/totalobservationnumber of 0.12 and 0.028 below and above 4km altitudes, while CALIPSO Level 2 products reported 0.07 and 0.012, respectively. The improvements are mainly in weak source and transporting regions, and the upper troposphere, where optically thin, but significant dust layers from the point of view of aerosol-cloud interactions are dominated. The results can help us to better understand global dust transportation and dust-cloud interactions and improve model simulations. Long-range transport of dust in the free troposphere is important for many aspects of atmospheric science including radiative transfer, cloud microphysics, atmospheric chemistry, oceanic biogeochemical processes, and air quality. However, the representation of airborne dust in models is a long outstanding issue. Recent model evaluations showed that vertical dust distributions have large discrepancies between model simulations and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation CALIPSO , with the largest discrepancies of up to ~500% in the free troposphere or at long distances from source regions. These studies highlight the need for improved observations to better constrain model processes, especially in the free troposphere where the dust loading is lower.Understanding global dust transport has attracted increasing interest in recent decades. Due to the limited spatial and temporal coverage of ground-based observations, satellite observations are predominantly used to study global dust properties and transport and to constrain and improve model simulations. Compared to column-integrated measurements from passive sensors, such as Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, and Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer, CALIPSO lidar provides the vertical distribution of aerosol information, which is crucial for studies of dust transport, aerosol radiative effects. Because of the nonspherical shape of dust aerosols, lidar depolarization measurements are widely used to distinguish dust from other types of aerosols. The volume depolarization ratio VDR method is often used to identify dense dust aerosols from CALIPSO lidar observations. Although this method can successfully identify dense dust layers and capture the main dust bands, thin dust layers, which may be less important to direct radiative effects but are important to aerosol-cloud interactions and indirect radiative effects, are often missed. Liu et al . showed that global annual mean shortwave and longwave cloud forcing are reduced by up to 2.0 ± 0.1 W m −2 and 2.4 ± 0.1 W m −2 , respectively, due to the presence of dust ice nuclei IN in the upper troposphere, with a net cloud forcing change of −0.40 ± 0.20 W m −2 . Therefore, there is a strong need for improving thin dust layer identification to provide a full view of global dust distribution.This paper aims to provide a new and complete global height-resolved dust distribution by improving thin dust identification based on CALIPSO polarimetric lidar measurements. Data sources are introduced in section 2 . The dust identification method is detailed in section 3 . Section 4 presents the results and discussion, and conclusions are summarized in section 5 .In this study, 2007–2009 nighttime CALIPSO, CloudSat, and operational meteorology data sets were used. CALIPSO 1B data provides 532 nm total attenuated backscatter β 532 and perpendicular polarization component β 532 p , with 30 m vertical resolution below 8.2 km, which were averaged to a 60 m vertical resolution to identify dust aerosols.A challenging part of lidar dust detection is separating optically thin ice clouds from aerosols. Thus, the cloud mask in the CloudSat 2B-GEOPROF product was joined with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization CALIOP measurements to provide a combined lidar-radar cloud mask. CloudSat carries a 94 GHz cloud profiling radar CPR , which provides an instantaneous footprint of approximately 1.3 km and has 125 vertical bins with 240 m vertical bins. The CPR is more sensitive to large particles than CALIOP and has weak cloud attenuation. Therefore, combined CPR and CALIOP measurements provide more reliable cloud structure. Temperature and pressure profiles from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting AUX ECMWF-AUX algorithm were used to calculate molecular backscattering.CALIOP Level 2 5 km layer products CAL-L2 were used for comparisons. These products report cloud and aerosol information on a 5 km horizontal grid, containing results with horizontal averaging of 5, 20, and 80 km. Clouds and aerosols are discriminated by using a combination of 532 nm backscatter magnitude and attenuated color ratio. Aerosols are ascribed into desert dust, smoke, polluted dust, clean continental aerosol, polluted continental aerosol, and marine aerosol.To improve thin dust layer detection, CALIOP signals must be heavily averaged before detection. Averaging over the extended horizontal length is helpful to reduce random noise and improve detection sensitivity as illustrated by Figures 2.3 and 2.4 in Vaughan and Powell . In those figures, detection sensitivities in the 532 nm channel at 0 km mean sea level are ~0.0014, ~0.0011, ~0.00018, and ~0.00013 sr −1  km −1 when averaged to 1, 5, 20, and 80 km, respectively. This shows that increasing the averaging length can significantly reduce noise up to ~20 km, after which improvement by averaging becomes minor. Figure  1 shows simulations of dust measurement capabilities under different averaging lengths and dust loading. Lidar ratios S of 40 and 65 sr and particle depolarization ratios PDRs of 0.3 and 0.1 were selected for pure and polluted dust simulations, respectively. Results show that it is difficult to identify dust layers with dust extinction smaller than 0.01 km −1 below 8 km in β 532 , because the signals blue and green lines fall into noise ranges. The VDR method i.e., with a threshold of 0.06 also misses such a weak dust layer for both pure and polluted dust cases. Figure  1 also clearly shows that the β 532 p is more sensitive to the presence of a weak dust layer than β 532 or VDR. However, for a weaker polluted dust layer such as <0.001 km −1 , β 532 p does not have enough signal-to-noise ratio to confidently detect such a weaker layer with 30 km horizontal averaging. On the other hand, simply increasing the averaging length may not be helpful for weak dust aerosol detection because the averaging of clear sky no or low aerosols or other types of aerosol signals weakens the true dust aerosol signals and decreases detection sensitivity. Although such a thin dust layer is less important to direct radiative forcing, Liu et al . showed that the indirect radiative forcing effect is significant when there is sufficient number of dust IN in the upper troposphere i.e., 50–200 L −1 . Assuming a radius of 2.8 × 10 − 6  m, a density of 2.5 × 10 3 kg m −3 , a frozen fraction of 0.1, and a specific extinction coefficient of 0.7 × 10 3 m 2 kg −1 , 200 L −1 and 50 L −1 IN correspond to dust extinctions of α∼ 7.5 × 10 − 3 and ∼ 1.88 × 10 − 3 km −1 , respectively. Therefore, 30 km averaging was adopted for this study to provide the needed sensitivity. Defining the detection limit as twice the measured noise at 30 km horizontal averaging, Figure  1 a shows that the detection limit in β 532 is ~0.004 km −1 for altitudes >8 km and ~0.01 km −1 for altitudes <8 km. Furthermore, averaging was done only for possible dust profiles based on quick dust mask to ensure the expected detection sensitivity. a Simulated β 532 with different aerosol loadings red = 0.1 km −1 , blue = 0.01 km −1 , green = 0.001 km −1 , and black for molecular only . The black dashed and dotted lines are noise ranges at 1 and 30 km averaging, respectively. Solid and dashed colored lines represent simulated β 532 for pure dust S = 40 sr, PDR = 0.3 and polluted dust S = 65 sr, PDR = 0.1 , respectively; b simulated β 532 p for pure solid lines and polluted dust dashed lines ; simulated VDR for c pure and d polluted dust at 1 km averaging; simulated VDR for e pure and f polluted dust at 30 km averaging. Thin colored lines in Figures  1c–1 f indicate the noise range.First, a quick dust mask based on β 532 p was built. Figure  1 shows that β 532 p is sensitive to the presence of dust and have stronger dust signals, which favors strong peaks due to noise. As shown in Figure  2 d, the weak or dense dust layer signals in β 532 p show more peaks than clear sky signals or other types of aerosols or clouds, not shown here . Based on this characteristic, a quick dust mask can be determined for both cloud-free and cloudy conditions, as shown in Figure  2 d. Peaks within β 532 p profile were identified by a threshold of 4 times of the measured noise to achieve the peak mask one means peak and zero means nonpeak . Then, a 6 × 3 horizontal × vertical, same as the following moving average was calculated for the peak mask to build the mean peak number as the peak index Figure  2 d . It is clear that the peak index for clear sky is less than 0.1 corresponding to approximately two peaks within 18 bins and that the peak index for the possible dust layer is larger than 0.1. To detect the boundary of the possible dust layer, a further three-time iterative examining was performed to set any peaks to zero when the 11 × 3 and 21 × 3 moving averages of the peak mask are smaller than the corresponding thresholds determined from the clear sky i.e., approximately two peaks within 33 and 63 bins, respectively . Some strong noise peaks may be persistent, which have small peak areas and irregular large peak values only in β 532 p and thus very large PDRs. Those spikes were removed by the threshold of the layer depth <0.3 km and retrieved layer mean PDRs LPDR >0.5. The quick dust masks are presented in Figure  2 f, which shows that our new method can capture more accurate dust layer boundaries than CAL-L2 dust masks Figure  2 e .Dust case from 17:49 to 17:56 UTC on 3 February 2007. a Geolocation of the satellite ground track, b β 532 , c β 532 p , d peak index, e CAL-L2 feature mask, f fast dust mask, g dust feature LPDR, and h final dust mask.Using the quick dust masks, a 30 km horizontal moving average was applied to dusty β 532 profiles. Then, the Fernald method was used to retrieve dust extinctions with the dust layer top determined by the quick dust masks. For dust layers detected above a cloudy layer, extinction retrieval ends at 0.3 km above the cloud top. For dust layers detected below optically thin cloud layers, the cloud optical depth is retrieved by the opaque method, and then the dust layers with layer tops 1 km lower than the cloud layers were retrieved. An initial S of 40 sr was used for pure dust. Then, a first-guessed LPDR was calculated with 30 km smoothed β 532 and 1 km β 532 p profiles and is reported at 1 km resolution. Simulations showed that the difference in PDRs by S of 40 and 65 sr was less than 10%. If the estimated LPDR was smaller than 0.15, indicating that the aerosol layer may be smoke or polluted dust, extinction coefficients were retrieved again with S of 65 sr to update the LPDR. Figure  2 g shows the LPDR.The retrieved LPDR was then used to refine the dust mask. Layers with LPDR <0.075 may correspond to other types of aerosols with spherical particles. Layer with LPDR >0.5 and bottom >5 km may correspond to misidentified clouds. Therefore, these layers were removed from the dust masks to build the final dust mask Figure  2 h . The influence of the LPDR thresholds was examined based on the dust and nondust LPDR distributions. In CAL-L2, the mean nondust aerosol LPDR was 0.043. With a LPDR threshold of 0.075, 11.8% of dust cases were excluded, while ~2.7% of nondust cases could be included. With a lower LPDR threshold of 0.05, ~9.8% of nondust cases were included. Therefore, a threshold of 0.075 was adopted for this study. The upper LPDR threshold of 0.5 only excludes <2% of the total cases in the fast dust mask. Finally, only dust layers with layer tops below 10 km and with a horizontal scale larger than 30 km, or dust layers with layer tops below 6 km and extinctions larger than 0.02, were regarded as confident dust layers for further analyses in this study.Lidar signals over South America are strongly affected by the South Atlantic anomaly SAA , which results in more spikes in measured signals. This part of the data was removed by examining the number of spikes in β 532 p at an altitude of 18–20 km, shown as the blank areas over South America in Figure  3 . In addition, dust identification was not performed over the Antarctic region south of 65°S due to very low dust concentration.Three year seasonal mean global dust occurrences at different altitude ranges based on the new global dust data set referred as NEW and CAL-L2. The seasonal changes of blank areas over Arctic imply the northern boundaries of nighttime satellite tracks. The data used to generate this figure can be found at ftp://cat.uwyo.edu/pub/bigdata/GLOBAL_DUST_FREQUENCY/GLOBAL_DUST_FREQUENCY.hdf .The new methodology was applied to 2007–2009 nighttime observations to provide a new global dust data set referred as NEW . The global dust occurrence was then calculated and compared with nighttime CAL-L2. Dust occurrence was defined as total detected dust case number total observation number in each grid box and altitude range. For CAL-L2 dust occurrence, the dust case includes both dust and polluted dust aerosols with 5 km, 20 km, and 80 km horizontal averaging. Moreover, the NEW in 2007 was collocated into the CAL-L2 5 km footprint referred as DATA2007 to compare the performance of the new methodology to global data sets, except for the SAA region.Three year mean 2.5° × 2.5° global dust occurrences at different altitude ranges and seasons based on NEW and CAL-L2 are shown in Figure  3 . The NEW greatly improves the global dust distribution by detecting more dust cases and providing more accurate dust layer boundaries. In Figure  3 , the main dust band from the Sahara dust region to the Asia dust region shows a similar shape but enhanced dust occurrence in the NEW. The occurrences within altitudes <2 km above ground level agl over the Sahara dust region are consistent between the two data sets within the range of uncertainty due to dense dust in the boundary layer over the source regions. As highlighted in Figure  2 based on an Asia dust case, the CAL-L2 mainly detected strong dust layers and missed significant weak dust layers surrounding the strong ones in the free troposphere. With increasing altitude, differences in dust occurrences between the two data sets become larger and the NEW detects more dust cases than CAL-L2 because dust layers become weaker with altitude. This explains the low dust occurrence in CAL-L2 at altitudes >6 km agl except during March, April, and May MAM . For the Asia dust source region, occurrences in both data sets are around 0.4–0.5 when altitudes <4 km agl. However, the NEW indicates that dust can be transported upward to 10 km agl and to the east over the Pacific during every season. In the CAL-L2, such upward and over-the-Pacific transport is very weak except for MAM. Detailed assessment of strong dust source regions using the DATA2007 showed that the NEW missed ~8%, ~24%, and ~82% of the dust cases identified in CAL-L2 within altitude ranges of <4, 4–8, and 8–10 km agl, respectively. Most of the missed dust cases were identified as clouds in the NEW. Rates of missed dust were reduced to 2.5%, 5%, and 16%, respectively, after removing such cloud cases. The low and high LPDR thresholds used to ensure confident detection were the main reasons for the misses. However, removing aerosol layers around clouds and the 30 km horizontal scale might also contribute to the differences. In contrast, CAL-L2 missed 21%, 26%, and 51% of the dust cases in the NEW in the respective altitude ranges, which were mostly optically thin dust layers.For weak dust source regions such as North America, Australia, and the southern end of Africa, the NEW shows higher dust occurrences than the CAL-L2, with near-ground dust occurrence generally around 0.5 or more. For example, over Australia in June, July, and August JJA below 2 km agl, the NEW shows an occurrence of ~0.5, while CAL-L2 mainly detects dust aerosols above the northern Australia with an occurrence of ~0.3–0.4. Below 4 km agl, the NEW reports an annual mean occurrence of 0.24, which is twice of that in the CAL-L2. Over the United States, below 4 km agl, the NEW reports a 0.14 higher dust occurrence than the CAL-L2.Over dust transport regions, the NEW generally reports higher dust occurrences than the CAL-L2. Below 4 km agl, the NEW reports ~0.1 more dust occurrences than the CAL-L2 over most dust transport regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Above 4 km, the NEW reports up to 0.06 more dust occurrence over the Northern Hemisphere. However, there are weak dust occurrence regions where the CAL-L2 reported higher values than the NEW. For example, there is a persistent weak dust band in the CAL-L2 during all seasons at ~60°S, which can be more clearly identified between 4 and 6 km agl in Figures  4 b1– 4 b4. This weak dust band is mainly due to misclassifying clouds as dust in the CAL-L2 as indicated by the DATA2007. The cloud–aerosol discrimination CAD algorithm usually misclassified weak scattering edges of ice clouds as aerosols and thus produced anomalous enhancements of aerosol loading in the upper troposphere. Combined CPR and CALIOP measurements in the NEW provide more reliable vertical cloud structure information than CAL-L2. DATA2007 showed that misclassified clouds dominated the CAL-L2 dust masks above 6 km agl or within 30°N–60°N and 30°S–60°S latitude bands. The final LPDR cut and 30 km averaging used in the NEW also caused underestimations of dust occurrences in some regions, such as over the North Pacific above 8 km agl during December, January, and February DJF .Three year zonal mean dust occurrences for different seasons: a1–a4 NEW, b1–b4 CAL-L2, c1–c4 difference between the two, and d1–d4 Community Atmosphere Model 5 CAM5 simulated dust mixing ratio.The improvement of the NEW in weak dust regions and the free troposphere can be easily seen in the 3 year zonal mean dust occurrences during different seasons Figure  4 . In the Northern Hemisphere, near the source regions latitudes between 0°N and 30°N, below 4 km , the dust occurrence in the NEW is about 0.05, 0.08, 0.14, and 0.08 higher than that in CAL-L2 during September, October, and November SON , DJF, MAM, and JJA, respectively. The NEW shows that dust from these source regions is transported to higher altitudes and more northward compared to CAL-L2, as can be expected from dust transport. In the Southern Hemisphere source regions between 20°S and 30°S, below 4 km , the dust occurrence in the NEW is generally 0.04 higher than that in CAL-L2. The dust layer in these regions can be transported up to 5 km agl in the NEW, while CAL-L2 mainly shows a transport up to 3 km agl, except for SON.High occurrences of dust in the upper troposphere of the Northern Hemisphere are observed with in situ data, but we are lacking suitable data to evaluate the observed spatial pattern. The modeled dust global distributions showed that there are lots of dust loadings over weak dust source regions and in the upper troposphere. Figures  4 d1– 4 d4 show 3 year zonal mean vertical dust mixing ratio from the Community Atmosphere Model 5 CAM5 simulations, in which we nudged modeled horizontal winds toward the ERA-Interim reanalysis from 2007 to 2009 after 3 months spin-up at model horizontal resolution of 1.9° × 2.5° and vertical resolution of 30 levels to minimize natural variability of the large-scale circulation. The modeled dust distributions indicated that significant dust aerosols could be transported vertically into upper troposphere. Although there are larger uncertainties in model-simulated dust magnitudes, the expected dynamical transfer indicates that the new dust data sets improved the dust detection in the thin dust-dominated regions.A new methodology for dust identification using CALIPSO data was developed. The new method takes advantage of stronger dust signals in the CALIPSO lidar perpendicular channel to more accurately identify dust layer boundaries. Furthermore, cloud targets are identified by combining CALIPSO and CloudSat products, which improves the optically thin ice clouds detection. Simulations show that the new method can detect optically thin but significant, dust layers form the point of view of aerosol-cloud interactions, especially in the upper troposphere. Comparison with CAL-L2 showed that the new method has significant potential of detecting both thin and dense dust layers with much lower cloud contamination. The new method was applied to 3 year CALIPSO observations, and a new global dust data set was built. Three year global mean results except for SAA show that the new method detects dust occurrences of 0.12 and 0.028 below and above 4 km altitude while CAL-L2 reports 0.07 and 0.012, respectively. These improvements are consistent with model-suggested dynamical dust transportations although model-simulated magnitudes have large uncertainties. With improved dust detection over weak source regions, transport areas, and the upper troposphere, the new dust data set helps to better understand global dust generation and transport processes and other dust-related studies.In this study, we did not separate pure and polluted dust layers. A separate effort is necessary to retrieve global dust extinctions using an improved two-component lidar retrieval method to better resolve dust and nondust extinctions for polluted dust. The ultimate goal is to provide a more reliable dust occurrence and extinction data set to evaluate and improve model dust simulations."
29,impact dust,"Assimilation of next generation geostationary aerosol optical depth retrievals to improve air quality simulations. Planned geostationary satellites will provide aerosol optical depth AOD retrievals at high temporal and spatial resolution which will be incorporated into current assimilation systems that use low-Earth orbiting e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS AOD. The impacts of such additions are explored in a real case scenario using AOD from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager GOCI on board of the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorology Satellite, a geostationary satellite observing northeast Asia. The addition of GOCI AOD into the assimilation system generated positive impacts, which were found to be substantial in comparison to only assimilating MODIS AOD. We found that GOCI AOD can help significantly to improve surface air quality simulations in Korea for dust, biomass burning smoke, and anthropogenic pollution episodes when the model represents the extent of the pollution episodes and retrievals are not contaminated by clouds. We anticipate future geostationary missions to considerably contribute to air quality forecasting and provide better reanalyses for health assessments and climate studies. Agencies in North America, Europe, and East Asia plan to launch geostationary satellites to continuously monitor the composition of the atmosphere. Some examples are the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events GEO-CAPE , Sentinel-4, Geostationary Mission Meteorology and Atmospheric Pollution in Asia GMAP-Asia , and the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite GEO-KOMPSAT -2 missions. Objectives of these missions include better observing air quality and providing additional constraints to air quality and climate models. The potential of these systems to improve air quality predictions is usually assessed through Observing System Simulation Experiments, which consist in assimilating simulated observations generated using projected instrument characteristics.One important application of the new observing systems is to improve the capabilities to predict ambient aerosol distributions, which can help to reduce the large uncertainties associated with current estimates of their impact on human health and climate change. Current approaches assimilate aerosol optical depth AOD retrievals from low-Earth orbiting LEO satellites. The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager GOCI on board of the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorology Satellite COMS provides the first geostationary multispectral aerosol optical depth AOD retrieval. Monitoring transboundary pollution in northeast Asia was demonstrated by combining these retrievals with simulations through a simple assimilation scheme. Although GOCI AOD has been shown to be reliable when compared to estimates from LEO satellites and to fill some of the data gaps found in LEO retrievals, there is a need to assess the impacts of incorporating GOCI AOD data into “operational” systems that already assimilate LEO retrievals, i.e., to perform an Observing System Experiment. As GOCI specifications have similarities with the planned payloads on future geostationary satellites, such a study provides a realistic assessment of the capabilities of upcoming missions. In the following we describe results of such an experiment showing the impact of these new observations on simulation skill and provide recommendations on the readiness of current models and assimilation systems to utilize these new observations.The impact of new observations on simulation skill is dependent not only on the qualities of the observations accuracy, spatial and temporal sampling, representativeness, etc. but also on the capabilities of the forward model and the assimilation system. We used the chemistry version of the Weather Research and Forecasting WRF-Chem model version 3.5, which has advanced capabilities to model size and chemically resolved aerosols along with their effects on meteorology at high resolution. The assimilation was performed using the Grid-point Statistical Interpolation GSI three-dimensional variational 3DVAR system modified to assimilate AOD within WRF-Chem for the eight bin Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry aerosol model MOSAIC . For a given time, the 3DVAR system optimizes a cost function adjusting 3-D aerosol mass and size distributions to improve model agreement to AOD observations while minimizing the departures from the initial model estimates. AOD was computed using the WRF-Chem optical properties model, which considers aerosols as an internal mixture, explicitly accounts for aerosol water uptake, and uses Mie theory along with Chebyshev expansion coefficients. The adjoint of this code was used for computing the derivatives used during assimilation. After optimization, the WRF-Chem model was restarted with the updated 3-D aerosol fields producing a full chemistry/aerosol simulation until the next assimilation cycle, thus producing a regional reanalysis. Also, a daily 9 UTC cycle 48 h unconstrained simulation is performed to assess the long-lasting impact that the AOD assimilation could have in a forecasting system. Model configuration and assimilation scheme follows Saide et al . unless noted otherwise.WRF-Chem was configured with two domains Figure  1 a , a coarser one of 36 km grid spacing covering source regions important for the period analyzed and an inner one of 12 km grid spacing covering the COMS/GOCI field of view. Dust emissions were computed online using the Goddard Aerosol Radiation and Transport GOCART scheme, anthropogenic emissions were from the MIX mosaic Asian anthropogenic emission inventory for Model Inter-Comparison Study MICS -Asia and Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution HTAP projects, http://mix.greenresource.cn/ base year 2010, and biomass burning emission estimates were from Quick Fire Emissions Data set and included into WRF-Chem using the online plume-rise model. Both domains used 52 vertical levels with the first five levels of ~50 m thickness. The coarse domain used initial and boundary conditions from National Centers for Environmental Prediction NCEP Final Analysis FNL, http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds083.2/ and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate reanalyses for meteorology and chemistry, respectively. The coarse domain simulation was run continuously from 20 April to 9 May 2012 and used analysis nudging of temperature, humidity, and winds above the boundary layer. In addition, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS AOD retrievals see details below were assimilated in the coarse domain, and these results were used as boundary conditions for all experiments performed on the inner domain. This configuration provides analyzed boundary conditions for the inner domain which are consistent with respect to the transport, chemistry, and assimilation tools, which would not be the case if global analyses were used as boundary conditions for the inner domain. a Modeling domains outer in solid blue, inner in dashed blue , GOCI domain black dash-dotted line , source regions, and back trajectory paths for the pollution episodes studied. The source regions correspond to dust shown by erosion fraction over 2%, in yellow , anthropogenic pollution shown by carbon monoxide emissions above 100 mol/km 2 /h, in green , and biomass burning smoke shown by organic carbon emissions above 1 µg/m2/s, for 4 May, 6 UTC, in dark red , with corresponding trajectories in brown 1 , dark green 2 , and red 3 . Plus sign makers denote 1 day old trajectories. Back trajectories were performed with FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model FLEXPART driven by the WRF-Chem simulations. See text for more details. b Observed and c modeled no assimilation attenuated Lidar backscattering at Seoul National University station black dot in Figure  1 a . Red boxes represent the different pollution episodes see “long-range transport episodes” section . d Backscattering relative difference in % between GOCI + MODIS assimilation and the no assimilation simulations.We show results from three simulations on the inner domain which represent three assimilation strategies: no data assimilation, assimilation of MODIS AOD only, and simultaneous assimilation of MODIS and GOCI AOD. Although the use of observationally constrained retrievals is recommended for MODIS assimilation, these retrievals have not been developed yet for GOCI AOD, so we used MODIS and GOCI raw products for consistency. MODIS AOD data correspond to collection 5.1 from Terra and Aqua satellites, from both over land “Corrected_Optical_Depth_Land” product and over ocean “Effective_Optical_Depth_Average_Ocean” product “dark target” retrievals at the 550 nm wavelength. We only used AOD retrievals performed over at least 30% of the “dark” area of each 10 by 10 km pixel i.e., MODIS cloud fraction lower than 0.7 , which is an intermediate threshold compared to what is used in different observationally constrained retrievals and provides a compromise between high-data volume and reduced likelihood of cloud contamination. GOCI AOD retrievals were from the latest version GloA2 of the Yonsei aerosol retrieval algorithm and were provided hourly from 00:30 to 07:30 UTC at 6 km resolution. To reduce possible cloud contamination and noise of the data being assimilated, adjacent pixels to missing values were discarded and only AOD values below 2.5 were used. Also, only retrievals over ocean were considered as only this algorithm has been validated. Simulations were done to produce reanalyses, with assimilation starting from 23 April and performed every 3 h using the mean of 02:30–03:30 and 05:30–06:30 GOCI retrievals for the 3 and 6 UTC cycles, respectively, while using the 00:30 UTC GOCI retrieval for the 00 UTC cycle. GOCI AOD data were thinned to a 10 km grid to match the MODIS AOD resolution. The background error covariance matrix was computed using the National Meteorological Center NMC method as described in Saide et al ., by using two continuous simulations driven by FNL and NCEP/National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalyses http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds090.0/ on the 36 km domain and using the differences between them to compute horizontal and vertical standard deviations and length scales.Observations used for validation correspond to Aerosol RObotic NETwork AERONET stations deployed for the Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observation Networks DRAGON Asia 2012 Japan and South Korea field experiment, Korean PM10 particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less measurements from the National Air Monitoring Information System, and attenuated backscatter from a Lidar at Seoul National University. Metrics used for model evaluation are described in Text S1 in the supporting information and include fractional and absolute measures of bias and error Table  1 .From 26 April to 9 May 2012, Korea and Japan experienced the long-range transport of dust and fire plumes, and anthropogenic air pollution, with periods of high-aerosol concentrations at the surface and aloft. This period allows evaluating the impact of GOCI data on simulation skill under a variety of conditions and testing the various components of the system i.e., forward model, observations, and assimilation . The aerosol variability is shown in the observed attenuated backscatter Figure  1 b , AERONET AOD data Figures  2 a and 2 b , and surface PM10 concentrations Figure  2 c .Time series of observed and modeled distributions of a, b AERONET AOD and c PM10. Simulations correspond to without data assimilation and with simultaneous assimilation of MODIS and GOCI AOD. While AERONET data are shown as daily statistics for Korea Figure  2 a, 17 sites and Japan Figure  2 b, 10 sites , PM10 is shown only over Korea for 6 h intervals 304 monitors . Center solid lines indicate the median, circles represent the mean, boxes indicate upper and lower quartiles, and whiskers show the upper and lower deciles. Average hours with AOD data within stations per day are indicated on top of each AERONET panel.A dust event heavily impacted the northern Korean peninsula from 27 to 29 April with AERONET AODs sometimes going over 1.5, and the dust reached Japan on 28 April to 1 May with a smaller impact maximum AOD of 0.7 Figures  2 a and 2 b . During this period, AERONET Angstrom exponent values were generally below 1 and as low as 0.2 not shown , characteristic of dust coarse aerosol. A representative back trajectory for this event is shown in Figure  1 a brown , which starts from 00 UTC 28 April at 1500 m over Seoul, where a thick plume was detected at this height by the Lidar Figure  1 b . This plume originated from the Gobi desert almost 2 days before. Although the Lidar generally shows higher-dust loads above 1 km, this dust event also impacted surface aerosol concentrations in Korea, as seen by the enhanced backscatter near the surface on 28 April Figure  1 b and the increase in PM10 concentrations during this period Figure  2 c .The second event type corresponds to anthropogenic pollution under westerly flows. These events can be observed in Korea on 2–3, 4–5, and 7–8 May Figures  1 b, 2 a, and 2 c , with the latter two also affecting Japan on 5–6 and 7–8 May Figure  2 b . Figure  1 a shows a typical back trajectory for this type of event dark green , which starts from 500 m over Seoul at 21 UTC on 4 May, where a thick plume was observed by the Lidar Figure  1 b and the highest PM10 concentrations in the period studied were measured ~110 µg/m 3 mean across all Korean monitors, Figure  2 c . The transport pattern for these events corresponds to stagnation over the highly populated areas in eastern China followed by low-altitude fast advection ~1 day over the Yellow Sea associated with a frontal passage, which then sometimes reaches Japan.The third type of episode for the period studied corresponds to biomass burning smoke coming from boreal fires in south-eastern Siberia red back trajectory, Figure  1 a , which affected the Korean peninsula on 6–8 May. The Lidar record at Seoul shows a plume at 3–4 km altitude around 6 UTC on 6 May, which can be traced through back trajectories to fire emissions from Siberian boreal fires 1 day before. The Lidar observations also show high near-surface aerosol loads on 6 May, which trajectory analyses not shown classify as older smoke. As previously mentioned, 7–8 May also experienced an anthropogenic pollution episode, thus there is an overlap between these two episode types, where different sources contribute to the aerosol loads at different vertical layers and at different times throughout the day.The simulations without data assimilation the forward model captured many of the main features of these events Figures  1 c and 2 . For example, the model without data assimilation captured the dust episode but underestimated the intensity in Korea and underestimated the surface concentrations significantly. Skillful representation of dust in models is hard to achieve, and other studies have found similar underestimation when using online dust emissions. While the model without data assimilation picks up the anthropogenic pollution episodes on 4–5 and 7–8 May, the peak aerosol loads are underestimated, and the main part of the 2–3 May event over Korea is missed, likely to a meteorological mismatch not bringing enough low-level aerosols into the peninsula. The model without data assimilation captures the fire plumes at 3–4 km with lower aerosol loadings and greatly underestimates the near-surface smoke. Uncertainties in biomass burning emissions are a major source of error in air quality forecasts.These results illustrate that the forward model has both skill and deficiencies. Sources of the model errors include uncertainties in the episodic emissions of dust and fires, errors in the horizontal and vertical transport of plumes, and uncertainties associated with secondary aerosol production e.g., secondary organic aerosol formation and secondary inorganic formation due to heterogeneous processes , among others. These results also illustrate the need to use data assimilation to better constrain the system and improve aerosol simulation skill. Note that all the trajectories shown for the different episodes cross the Yellow Sea at some point; thus, there is potential for improvement in simulation skill over Korea with the GOCI AOD data.Figures  2 and 3 show results from the three simulations performed. When averaged over the entire analysis period, the simulations without data assimilation are biased low in the Korean peninsula when compared to AERONET and PM10 stations Table  1 and Figure  3 , left column . Assimilating only MODIS AOD improves the simulated fractional bias over all AERONET stations and for most PM10 stations 98%, Table  1 in Korea. However, biases tend to improve slightly station wise for both networks Figure  3 , middle column and overall fractional bias mean bias improvements are 0.1 0.08 for AOD and 0.07 5.3 µg/m 3 for PM10 Table  1 .Maps showing model performance in terms of fractional bias FB by site against top row AERONET and bottom row PM10 stations in Korea. Left, center, and right columns correspond to simulations without data assimilation, with data assimilation of MODIS AOD only, and with data assimilation of both MODIS and GOCI AOD, respectively.It is important to point out that the assimilation approach used results in changes in the aerosol quantities that vary with height Figure  1 d . The vertical gradients in the assimilated simulations are a complex function of the increments of each assimilation step and the further transport of these increments. An example is the dust episode over Korea around 28 April. For this case, scaling factors next to the surface are much higher than aloft, which should not be expected out of a single-assimilation step, as scaling the upper layer would result in less departures from the initial model state which would be more optimal for the cost function. However, as the system performs a sequence of assimilations and simulations, there are previous times where only the near-surface plume is present, which is scaled and then advected to the Lidar location. This is a mechanism for which, even though AOD is a column measurement, successive AOD assimilation can improve the vertical representation on the model and impact the surface values. The chance of this happening increase as the volume of data is increased, which is the case when including the GOCI data into assimilation.The inclusion of GOCI AOD retrievals into the assimilation system improves the AOD simulations when compared to AERONET stations Table  1 and Figure  3 , top right . In Korea, most stations improve their performance and the fractional bias improvements are increased substantially when GOCI retrievals are assimilated. For instance, in Korea, MODIS + GOCI assimilation results in 3 and 13 sites having fractional bias smaller than −0.08 and −0.23, respectively, while MODIS assimilation results in just 8 sites with values smaller than −0.23 and none smaller than −0.08 Figure  3 , top row . In terms of AOD time series Figure  2 a , besides generally being closer in mean and median to the observations, the spread across AERONET stations also improves for most times by the addition of GOCI AOD.The assimilation of GOCI AOD retrievals had an overall neutral effect on the simulation skill over Japan, with a slight worsening on fractional bias, increase in the fraction of stations with improved absolute error and bias, and little change in the rest of the metrics compared to MODIS AOD assimilation Table  1 with individual stations that improve and others that degrade for different times Figure  2 b . The less dramatic effect of the GOCI assimilation over Japan is due to several factors. First, the forward model AOD for Japan shows good skill Figure  2 b , with biases typically less than 0.1. Second, Japanese AERONET stations show fewer hours of measurements per day than Korean ones due to clouds affecting the area. Cloud contamination limits the number and quality of MODIS and GOCI retrievals, making it challenging to improve a model with good forward skill. The use of observationally constrained retrievals, which include algorithms for reducing cloud contamination effects, should alleviate such problems.The assimilation of the GOCI AOD retrievals also improves the surface PM simulations over Korea. When including GOCI AOD into the assimilation the fractional bias is improved substantially, reaching values smaller than −0.4 at most stations and generating an overall improvement from −0.56 to −0.19 Table  1 . In a similar way, mean bias is drastically improved going from −25.6 to −6.4 µg/m 3 , and error fractional and absolute is also reduced Table  1 . The higher time resolution in the GOCI data together with fewer data gaps e.g., no sunglint, less cloudy pixels due to time averaging benefits the assimilation, bringing the model closer to the observations. Assimilation of GOCI AOD has a long-lasting impact on the predictions extending over 2 days and with large reductions in bias and error when compared to MODIS-only assimilation Figure S1 . The mean bias for the first 15 h of simulation is reduced by more than 80%, after 24 h is reduced by ~50%, and after 48 h there is still a ~25% reduction. In comparison, reductions in mean bias when assimilating only MODIS AOD were always below 30%.The MODIS + GOCI assimilation is able to improve AOD simulations for the different pollution episodes Figure  2 a and is able to increase ground concentrations for the dust and smoke episodes and for the two anthropogenic pollution events at the end of the study period Figure  2 c . The first Chinese pollution outbreak 2–3 May is not completely captured by the nonassimilated model see previous section . Despite being partially cloudy days see decrease in hours of AOD data at this time, Figure  2 a , there are AOD increases in some stations due to assimilation increase in the upper decile value . However, this increase in AOD is barely reflected in surface concentrations. As shown in Figure  1 c, the highest-aerosol loads in the model during the event peak ~21 UTC, 2 May are around 3–5 km altitude a feature not found in the observations, Figure  1 b , thus the assimilation mainly modified this layer Figure  1 d , and the increase in aerosols at these altitudes did not affect the surface concentrations. This shows that correct representation of episodes is important for improving the impacts of the data being assimilated; thus, future work is needed to improve the forward model.For the biomass burning smoke episode over Korea 6–8 May the addition of GOCI AOD to the assimilation generally improved both AOD and PM10 simulations Figures  2 a and 2 c . For the periods when there was little improvement e.g., 6 May , the transport patterns were such that air masses came from the north and they spent little time over the ocean; thus, the assimilation of GOCI AOD has little impact on the simulation. It is also interesting to note that for the second anthropogenic pollution episode 4–5 May the MODIS + GOCI assimilation overestimated ground concentrations, especially for 5 May Figure  2 c . This affected only certain sites and times, as the mean and upper end of the distribution significantly overestimate the observations, while the median shows a closer to observed value. This is less evident but still present in the AERONET comparisons Figure  2 a , where only the upper decile shows overestimations. This can be tracked back to assimilation of spuriously high GOCI retrievals, probably due to cloud contamination. Thus, a better data quality assurance needs to be performed to avoid these problems.Although AOD is assimilated, improvements due to GOCI assimilation in PM10 simulations are larger when compared to AOD e.g., while mean bias MB is significantly improved and mean absolute error MAE is reduced for PM10, they show little change for AOD, Table  1 . One reason for this behavior is that AOD is a daytime measurement only, and as MODIS AOD is the only data with an overland component where most AERONET sites are , the GOCI impact comes only after transport and is not as direct as the MODIS impact. On the other hand, PM10 are continuous measurements and thus the chances of impacting them through increments due to GOCI assimilation increase. Another reason of the discrepancy between PM10 and AOD performance is related to the ability of sequential assimilation to change vertical distributions as described above . Assimilation with and without GOCI data can show similar AOD thus similar AOD metrics , but different surface PM10 due to the different vertical distributions, which in this case, drastically improves predictions.We used a state-of-the-art data assimilation system to assess the impacts on aerosol simulations when including AOD retrievals from a geostationary satellite in the assimilation system. AOD data from the GOCI instrument on board of the COMS satellite were included into an assimilation system that already assimilated MODIS AOD. The study period corresponded to 2 weeks where multiple air pollution episodes desert dust, biomass burning, and anthropogenic activities affected northeast Asia.In general, the model without data assimilation was able to capture major features of these pollution episodes but underestimated the aerosol column loads and surface concentrations. A control assimilation was performed using MODIS AOD only, which generally showed improvements of limited magnitude compared to AERONET AOD and ground-based PM10 measurements over Korea. Including GOCI AOD data into the assimilation improved the simulations. The most notable improvements occurred in the Korean peninsula, where overall PM10 fractional bias improvement was ~5 times the improvement when assimilating MODIS AOD only. A few instances where the assimilation decreased model performance were linked to problems with the AOD retrievals. Thus, development of observationally constrained retrievals and better cloud screening algorithms, especially targeted to geostationary sensors, is advised for proper addition into future assimilation systems. Furthermore, it is expected that additional improvements in simulation skill will come from utilizing GOCI information associated with the multiple wavelength observations in the assimilation system, which has been shown to add further information on aerosol size when using the same assimilation tool. This will be explored in the future once GOCI AOD is validated for multiple wavelengths.These results show the potential improvement of operational air quality predictions systems by the addition of geostationary data and serve as a real case scenario support for geostationary missions in the planning stage. Previous studies have found further impacts by additional assimilation of air quality monitoring networks, ground-based Lidar data, and satellite Lidar; thus, complementing these data sets with geostationary data will provide better constrained models to be used not only in air quality predictions and reanalyses but also in health assessments and climate studies."
30,dust aerosol,"The worst North American drought year of the last millennium: 1934. During the summer of 1934, over 70% of western North America experienced extreme drought, placing this summer far outside the normal range of drought variability and making 1934 the single worst drought year of the last millennium. Strong atmospheric ridging along the West Coast suppressed cold season precipitation across the Northwest, Southwest, and California, a circulation pattern similar to the winters of 1976-1977 and 2013-2014. In the spring and summer, the drying spread to the Midwest and Central Plains, driven by severe precipitation deficits downwind from regions of major dust storm activity, consistent with previous work linking drying during the Dust Bowl to anthropogenic dust aerosol forcing. Despite a moderate La Nina, contributions from sea surface temperature forcing were small, suggesting that the anomalous 1934 drought was primarily a consequence of atmospheric variability, possibly amplified by dust forcing that intensified and spread the drought across nearly all of western North America. The Dust Bowl drought of the 1930s was one of the worst environmental disasters in United States history, causing widespread crop failures, land degradation, human migration, and a permanent transformation in the social, economic, and agricultural structure of the Great Plains. The inception of this event is linked to sea surface temperature SST variations in the tropical Pacific, while the intensity and atypical spatial pattern of the drought is attributed to random atmospheric variability and/or dust aerosol and land surface feedbacks. Even by the standards set by the multiple years of the Dust Bowl drought, however, the summer of 1934 stands out as exceptionally severe.While the term “Dust Bowl” was not coined until the following year, 1934 directly set the stage for 1935 and the subsequent years that would be characterized by extensive drought, widespread dust storms including the Black Sunday storm of 14 April 1935 , and the formation of the Soil Conservation Service. The drying that fed the 1934 drought began the previous fall, with major precipitation deficits in California, the Northwest, the Southwest, and across the Southern Plains. By the spring of 1934, the drying shifted to the Central Plains and Midwest. Importantly, these precipitation deficits occurred during the primary seasons of moisture supply for the various regions i.e., winter and early spring in California and the West and spring over the Central Plains and Midwest , ensuring little likelihood of relief with the onset of summer. Accompanying the precipitation anomalies were five major dust storms originating in the Central Plains from November 1933 to May 1934, caused in part by anthropogenic land use practices. Three of these events occurred in April 1934 from 9–12, 18–20, and 21–24, which collectively spread dust as far east as North Carolina and Florida, while the largest dust storm on 9–12 May spread dust across most of the United States east of the Central Plains. By the end of 1934, it was estimated that 65% of the total area of the Great Plains had been damaged by wind erosion, with 15% severely affected.Beyond the dust storms and wind erosion, the drought had severe impacts on agriculture and water resources, as documented in a report issued by the federal government the following year. Through the summer of 1934, conditions for pasture, corn, and tame hay hay cut from cultivated grasses were considered extremely poor over most of western North America WNA , from Texas and New Mexico and up through Montana and the Dakotas. Reservoir levels were low across WNA, averaging ∼55% of capacity in Nevada, ∼40% in California, ∼22% in New Mexico, ∼18% in Idaho, and ∼13% in Colorado and Wyoming. By the end of the summer of 1934, over 1100 counties had received an emergency drought designation. Ultimately, the effects of the drought were so severe that in June 1934, President Roosevelt requested <DOLLAR/>525 million in drought relief from Congress, over half <DOLLAR/>275 million of which was intended to relieve the livestock industry by means of providing emergency feed, buying starving animals from farmers, and slaughtering excess herds for food relief.Previous studies have analyzed SST and land surface forcing during the persistent, multiyear Dust Bowl drought, but no study to date has conducted a comprehensive analysis specifically for the exceptional drought year of 1934. Moreover, while regional drought variability in North America is understood reasonably well, we know much less about the dynamics underlying multiregion, pancontinental drought events like 1934; events that, because of their extent, often have much larger social impacts. Here we analyze the summer drought of 1934 by investigating the seasonal evolution of the underlying climate anomalies, placing this drought within the context of the paleoclimate record, and drawing lessons regarding what might be learned to better understand the severity and occurrence of current and future pancontinental droughts.Our analysis is focused on the climate anomalies temperature and precipitation and dynamics during the “water year” October 1933 to September 1934 leading up to and during the summer drought of 1934. The main seasons of moisture supply are different across the various regions of WNA: for example, most precipitation falls in winter in the Southwest and along the West Coast, while spring and summer dominate the Central Plains. It is therefore likely that the drought in each region of WNA will have a different meteorological and dynamical explanation, and thus, a consideration of the climate anomalies across the entire water year is required.An updated version of the North American Drought Atlas NADA is used to characterize the 1934 drought and place this event within the context of North American drought variability over the last millennium. The NADA is a tree ring-based gridded reconstruction 0.5° lat/lon of summer season June-July-August; JJA Thornthwaite-Based Palmer Drought Severity Index PDSI . PDSI is a normalized index of drought, integrating changes in moisture supply precipitation and demand evapotranspiration with a memory timescale of about 12–18 months meaning that summer season PDSI will depend, at least partially, on climate anomalies in prior months and seasons . Negative PDSI values indicate drier than average conditions; positive values indicate wetter than average conditions. In the NADA, all anomalies are relative to the average baseline for 1931–1990, and we use data from the NADA spanning 1000–2005 Common Era C.E. .We calculate temperature and precipitation anomalies from the latest version 3.21 of the climate grids provided by the Climate Research Unit CRU at the University of East Anglia. The CRU climate grids are monthly average fields of climate variables that are interpolated from station observations to a uniform 0.5° lat/lon grid, with temporal coverage spanning the entire twentieth century 1901–2012 . SST anomalies are taken from the HadISST data set 1870 to present . We use 500 hPa geopotential heights from version 2 of the Twentieth Century Reanalysis 1871–2012 to investigate the dynamics. For a comparison with the winter of 2013–2014, we also use dynamical fields from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research NCEP-NCAR reanalysis 1948 to present . To make things consistent with the base period in the NADA, all anomalies are calculated relative to the mean climatology for 1931–1990, except for the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, which uses a baseline of 1948–1990.Drought during the summer of 1934, as reflected in the PDSI anomalies, was intense and widespread across much of North America Figure 1 , extending from the West Coast to the Great Lakes and from Texas to Montana. The tree ring-based PDSI estimates in the NADA Figure 1 , left are largely corroborated by PDSI values independently calculated from the CRU climate grids Figure 1 , right . Area-averaged NADA PDSI for western North America WNA: 125°W–85°W, 30°N–49°N in 1934 was −4.11, the single most intense drought year of the last millennium Figure 2 , top . This magnitude of drought in WNA was a departure of over 3.5 standard deviations from the long-term mean 1000–2005 C.E. and exceeded the magnitude of the second most intense drought year in WNA 1580, PDSI = −3.19 by almost 30%.Summer season JJA Palmer Drought Severity Index PDSI for 1934 from left the North American Drought Atlas and calculated from right the CRU 3.21 climate grids.For western North America 125°W–85°W, 30°–49° , top area-averaged PDSI and bottom percent area with PDSI anomalies less than or equal to −3, indicating extreme drought.In addition to being exceptionally intense, 1934 was also an outlier in terms of drought extent, with extreme drought PDSI ≤−3 covering 71.6% of WNA, the most extensive summer of extreme drought by a broad margin Figure 2 , bottom . By comparison, the second most extensive extreme drought year was 1956, when 49.3% of WNA was affected. The NADA ends in 2005 and therefore cannot be used to compare 1934 to more recent extreme drought years, such as 2011 and 2012. The National Climatic Data Center NCDC nevertheless tracks the percent area of the United States in “moderately to extremely dry” conditions over the instrumental period 1895 to present; see Acknowledgements for data URL . According to this metric, drought extent was above 70% for May through September 1934, averaging 77.2% in JJA. By comparison, the average for JJA of 2012 was only 59.7%, with a maximum extent in July of 61.8%. The average extent in JJA of 2011 was even lower at only 28.9%, indicating that 2011, while extreme, was highly localized predominantly in the Southwest and Southern Plains . These results confirm the NADA analysis, further supporting our observation that 1934 was the worst single year of drought in WNA of the last 1000 years.Cold SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific developed in the fall of 1933 Figure S1 , a transition to La Niña conditions typically associated with suppressed precipitation across the Southwest and Southern Plains. During October–December OND the NINO 3.4 index anomaly was −0.98 K, weakening slightly to −0.85K during January–March JFM in 1934. Despite the moderately strong La Niña, circulation over North America during OND Figure S2 and JFM Figure S3 diverged substantially from the canonical La Niña response. During a typical La Niña, a broad, zonally oriented band of high pressure extends across the Southwest and Southern Plains. Circulation during the fall and winter of 1933–1934, however, was characterized by an upper level ridge centered over the West Coast and an accompanying trough over the Northeast Figure 3 . This suggests that despite its strength, the 1933–1934 La Niña event was a relatively minor contributor to the precipitation deficits preceding the 1934 drought, even though persistent La Niña forcing was likely important to establishing the Dust Bowl as a long-term, multiyear event. left column Precipitation mm d −1 , middle column temperature K , and right column 500 hPa height m anomalies during the fall and winter of 1933–1934.Cold season precipitation was reduced across much of WNA during the winter of 1933–1934 Figure 3 , left column , with major deficits in California, the Northwest, and the eastern half of the United States. Along with the drying, warm temperatures prevailed across most of WNA, while most of eastern North America was anomalously cold Figure 3 , middle column . Such a dipole configuration, characterized by a ridge over the Gulf of Alaska or along the West Coast and a trough over northeast North America, would have acted to suppress precipitation over much of WNA and favored the advection of cold air from high latitudes into the eastern part of the continent. These circulation and climate anomalies strongly resemble the most recent winter of 2013–2014 Figure S4 when a similar, but more persistent, circulation pattern intensified the ongoing drought in California and the Southwest and caused extreme cold conditions in eastern North America.To further quantify the similarity between circulation during the winters of 1933–1934 and 2013–2014, we computed centered anomaly correlations ACc over North America 170°W–50°W, 20°N–70°N between monthly 500 hPa height fields for these two periods. Of all months during the water year of 1933–1934, November 1933 and March 1934 were the strongest circulation analogues to this most recent winter. Highest correlations with November 1933 are in November 2013 ACc = +0.51 , December 2013 ACc = +0.58 , January 2014 ACc = +0.74 , and March 2014 ACc = +0.57 . For March 1934, correlations are similarly strong with December 2013 ACc = +0.56 , January 2014 ACc = +0.68 , and March 2014 ACc = +0.64 . November 1933 also correlates strongly with circulation during October–December 1976 ACc = +0.64 to +0.71 , the beginning of one of the most severe Californian droughts in the historical record 1976–1977 . While further analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, these correlations do suggest that wintertime ridging along the West Coast may play a recurring role in driving precipitation deficits during major West Coast droughts.The 1933–1934 geopotential height and climate anomalies are not consistent with a La Niña SST forcing signal;, however, linked the 2013–2014 winter circulation pattern to SST variability preceding an El Niño event in the western tropical Pacific 110°E–160°E, 10°S–20°N . Compared to the winter of 2013–2014, SST anomalies in this region were relatively weak during 1933–1934. To more explicitly test the SST forcing hypothesis, however, we analyzed ensemble simulations of two atmospheric models forced by observed SSTs, simulations that will thus contain responses to precursor SST anomalies, including La Niña conditions and other global SST patterns. These models the Community Climate Model Version 3 CCM3 and the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System model version 5 GEOS-5 have been used previously to investigate SST forcing of North American drought variability. For 1933–1934, the ensemble mean in each model Figure S5 shows a circulation response much more consistent with the expected La Niña pattern than the observations Figures S2 and S3 . This confirms our previous analysis, indicating little role for SST forcing of the drought during the 1933–1934 winter.The center of drying and warming of the 1934 event moved to the Central Plains and Midwest in April and May, before shifting to the Southern Plains in June and July Figure 4 . From May afterward, the warm temperature anomalies were centered in regions where precipitation was below normal, likely reflecting the typically strong inverse relationship between warm-season temperature and precipitation in the Central Plains. Circulation during the spring and summer was characterized by a persistent ridge centered firmly over the Northwest and Northern Plains, a feature that would have inhibited convection and reduced moisture advection from the Gulf of Mexico, suppressing precipitation over the Plains. This circulation feature is absent in the SST-forced CCM3 and GEOS5 ensembles Figure S5 , suggesting little role for SST forcing during the spring and summer. left column Precipitation mm d −1 , middle column temperature K , and right column 500 hPa height m anomalies during the spring and summer of 1934.The most intense precipitation deficits, however, occurred downwind from the Plains across the Midwest, Ozarks, and the Ohio River Valley. As discussed in section 1 , large-scale dust storm events originated in the Central and Northern Plains regions e.g., North and South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska during April and May 1934, arising from a combination of reduced precipitation and/or poor land use practices. These events were large enough to spread dust across much of the Midwest and eastern United States e.g., Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania , regions that saw some of the largest precipitation deficits during these same months Figure 4 . This coherence is consistent with the hypothesis that the historically unprecedented dust storms during the Dust Bowl amplified and spread drying.Mineral dust aerosols typically have high shortwave albedo and will reduce net radiation at the surface and the top of the atmosphere. To compensate for this energy deficit, circulation will adjust through anomalous subsidence, inhibiting convection, cloud development, and precipitation. This circulation response was previously observed in model simulations of the Dust Bowl that included dust storms and aerosols, experiments that produced a higher-fidelity simulation of the long-term, persistent 1932–1939 Dust Bowl drought than experiments using SST forcing alone. Similarly, the vertical velocity anomalies for May 1934 Figure S6 show pronounced subsidence over the Midwest, corresponding to the same region of major precipitation deficits and dust aerosol loading during this month, a pattern similar to the dust-induced subsidence characterized in the Dust Bowl simulations. These previous experiments constrained the dust forcing using soil loss and wind erosion estimates from the Soil Conservation Service SCS . Unfortunately, there are no large-scale, quantitative estimates of soil losses and wind erosion available specifically for 1934 the SCS was not fully active until 1935 ; it is therefore impossible to conduct new simulations targeting drought attribution specifically for this year. However, these new observations, combined with previous modeling work and the highly anomalous nature of the 1934 event compared to the last millennium, suggest the possibility of anthropogenic dust aerosol forcing playing a role in amplifying the drought.Over the last decade, WNA experienced several droughts that highlighted the vulnerability of this area to water resource availability. Improving our understanding of drought evolution and dynamics is therefore a high research priority, especially for pancontinental events that span multiple regions and often have larger social and ecological impacts compared to regional droughts. In 1934, precipitation deficits coinciding with the main seasons of moisture supply in each region turned this year into the single most extensive and intensive year of extreme drought in WNA during the last thousand years, helping to transform the persistent Dust Bowl drought into a national environmental, social, and economic crisis. We argue that this event likely developed through an unfortunate confluence of internal variability and anthropogenic forcing that allowed drought to spread across nearly the entirety of WNA.During the winter, precipitation along the West Coast and in the Southwest was suppressed by a ridge centered on the coast, a pattern similar to the persistent circulation anomaly that dominated North American climate during the winter of 2013–2014 and in the fall preceding the severe 1976–1977 California drought. The recurrence of this ridging pattern during some of the worst historical West Coast droughts suggests that it may be a robust feature driving precipitation and drought variability in this region. Despite SSTs indicating a moderate La Niña, and SST-forced general circulation model GCM experiments simulating the expected dynamical response to La Niña over North America, the observed climate anomalies suggest that this climate mode played only a minor role in the 1934 drought. However, uncertainties in the underlying SST data set prior to 1950 may somewhat limit the ability to accurately capture the response to, for example, extratropical SST forcing in the GCM experiments.In the spring, precipitation deficits occurred in the Central Plains and Midwest, allowing the drought to spread across nearly the entire expanse of WNA, establishing the event as one of the few pancontinental droughts of the twentieth century. Coincident with these precipitation deficits were dust storms, a common occurrence in WNA during droughts. The scale of wind erosion and aeolian activity during the Dust Bowl including 1934 was nevertheless unprecedented since at least the Medieval Era, most likely amplified by human land use practices at the time. Moreover, much of the drying in April and May 1934 occurred not where the dust storms originated but rather downwind where dust aerosol loading in the atmosphere was observed. Because we could not conduct a formal attribution study, our analysis does not enable us to definitively attribute the warm-season drying to the dust storms at the time. However, when combined with previous modeling work demonstrating the role of dust aerosols in suppressing precipitation during the Dust Bowl, our results are suggestive of the possibility that dust aerosols would have amplified the drying in 1934, pushing this drought beyond the normal range of variability observed in the paleoclimate record.It is likely that given their rarity, pancontinental droughts do not all share the same underlying dynamical causes. For example, the severe decadal drought of the 1950s, which includes the widespread 1956 pancontinental event, can be reproduced in GCM simulations from SST forcing alone, suggesting a weaker role for either local feedbacks or internal atmospheric variability. The 1934 event nevertheless serves as a useful exposition of how compounding events may give rise to widespread drought across North America. While not all of the 1934 conditions will be applicable in the future, the well-known impact of tropical Pacific SSTs and our emerging understanding of the West Coast ridging and associated circulation dipole are two components of variability in the climate system that should be further tracked and studied as important underlying dynamics contributing to pancontinental drought events."
31,dust particles clouds,"The immersion mode ice nucleation behavior of mineral dusts: A comparison of different pure and surface modified dusts. In this study we present results from immersion freezing experiments with size-segregated mineral dust particles. Besides two already existing data sets for Arizona Test Dust ATD , and Fluka kaolinite, we show two new data sets for illite-NX, which consists mainly of illite, a clay mineral, and feldspar, a common crustal material. The experiments were carried out with the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator. After comparing the different dust samples, it became obvious that the freezing ability was positively correlated with the K-feldspar content. Furthermore, a comparison of the composition of the ATD, illite-NX, and feldspar samples suggests that within the K-feldspars, microcline is more ice nucleation active than orthoclase. A coating with sulfuric acid leads to a decrease in the ice nucleation ability of all mineral dusts, with the effect being more pronounced for the feldspar sample. Ice particles influence both the cloud radiative properties and the cloud lifetime. Although ice nucleation research has been ongoing for many decades now, there are still many open questions concerning the formation of ice in clouds. There are two primary processes that can initiate ice nucleation in the atmosphere, homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation. In contrast to the homogeneous ice nucleation, the heterogeneous ice nucleation is induced by a so-called ice nucleating particle INP . This INP lowers the energy barrier for the phase transition from water to ice, causing ice nucleation at higher temperatures than observed for homogeneous ice nucleation −38°C , for which no INP is present. Four different modes of heterogeneous ice nucleation are mentioned in the literature: deposition nucleation, immersion freezing, condensation freezing, and contact freezing. suggested the immersion freezing mode to be the most important freezing mode in mixed phase clouds, as they observed altocumulus clouds to almost always show a liquid cloud top before an onset of freezing was observed.There are some criteria which determine if a particle can act as an INP or not. These criteria range from size the bigger, the better over lattice match and hydrogen bonds to cracks and defects on the surface of the particle. An early study from and investigated the ice nucleation ability of K-feldspar, a mineral dust very common in the earth crust, with a cold stage cell. They found that freezing was already initiated at temperatures above −20°C. Additionally, they suggested that the ice nucleation of natural dust in general is controlled by the amount of K-feldspar in the aerosol particles. This idea was corroborated by, who found that the ice nucleation ability of two kaolinite samples correlated with the amount of K-feldspar in them. examined deposition ice nucleation of Arizona Test Dust ATD , a chemically very heterogeneous substance, and its mineral components which include orthoclase, an end-member of the K-feldspar group. They found that the ice nucleation ability of orthoclase was similar to that of ATD, while other constituents showed a lower ice nucleation activity.In our study, we show a comparison of the immersion freezing behavior of size-segregated mineral dust particles. New results of the immersion freezing ability of illite-NX and feldspar are presented and compared to existing data on ATD and Fluka kaolinite. Experiments were carried out with the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator LACIS . Additionally, we show immersion freezing measurements with sulfuric acid coated mineral dust particles.The illite-NX sample used in the present study was obtained from Arginotec B + M Nottenkämper . The feldspar sample was provided by the Technical University Darmstadt and originated from Minas Gerais, Brazil. Both substances were examined in the framework of the Ice Nucleation research UnIT INUIT project.The lattice structure of different minerals, e.g., illite and feldspar, is described in detail in. While clays generally have a layered structure, feldspars are composed of a lattice of tetrahedrals. The feldspar group contains a number of different end-members of which a few are given in Figure  1 . The end-members differ from each other by the contained cations K, Na, or Ca and/or by their lattice structure symmetry Figure  1 . top Structure symmetry of crystals. bottom Exemplary overview listing some members of the feldspar group. There are additionally, different mixtures exists, where, e.g., a mixture between albite and anorthite is called plagioclase. Sanidine is a mixture containing K as well as Na feldspar and has a monoclinic crystal structure.The illite-NX investigated here contained mainly illite. Besides that, it contained some amounts of other materials such as quartz, kaolinite, and feldspar. The values given for the fractions of these individual materials contained in illite-NX differ in the data sheet provided by the manufacturer, and in the literature. From our XRD analysis X-ray diffraction, Panalytical X‘Pert Pro, Almelo, Netherlands, equipped with a Cu X-ray tube and an automatic divergence aperture , we obtained a composition for illite-NX as shown in Table S1 in the supporting information . Furthermore, the XRD analysis revealed that the feldspars included in illite-NX 14% by mass are most likely orthoclase K-feldspar and sanidine Na and K-feldspar , but not microcline K-feldspar . Unfortunately, it was not possible to quantify the exact amounts of these two feldspars. found that the amount of K-feldspar in illite-NX is 8%. It should be mentioned that the mass fractions of the different minerals and particular the different feldspars contained in our samples are prone to uncertainties. However, combining the above listed information regarding the feldspar content in illite-NX, we assume that the illite-NX used in this study contains roughly 5% to 10% orthoclase. The feldspar sample used in our study consisted of 76% microcline K-feldspar and 24% albite Na feldspar, see also Table S1 in the supporting information .For the immersion freezing experiments presented here, size-segregated particles were used. Both pure and sulfuric acid coated particles were considered. The dry particle dispersion and the procedures for particle selection and coating closely follow those used during previous mineral dust related experiments with LACIS. For dry generation of airborne dust particles, we used a fluidized bed generator TSI 3400A, TSI Inc., St. Paul, Minnesota, USA . The sulfuric acid coatings were applied by means of a vapor diffusion tube, heated to temperatures of 70°C and 80°C. Downstream of the vapor diffusion tubes, the aerosol is passed over a water bath to increase the reactivity of the sulfuric acid with the particle surface. Subsequent to charging the particles with a bipolar diffusion charger Krypton 85 , particles were size selected, adjusting for a mobility diameter of 300nm. Thereto, a Differential Mobility Analyzer DMA , type Vienna Medium was used. Care was taken to minimize doubly charged particles by using a Micro-Orifice Uniform-Deposit Impactor MOUDI, Model 100R, MSP Corporation and a cyclone prior to the bipolar diffusion charger. Together these two devices provide a cut off diameter of 500nm. However, due to bounce off effects, a certain number of doubly charged particles were still present and corrected for. This correction was based on the particle size distribution measured downstream of the DMA by means of an Ultra-High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer, Droplet Measurement Technologies. A dilution system was used to adjust the particle number concentration. Subsequent to dilution, the aerosol flow was split into three streams. One stream was fed into a Condensation Particle Counter TSI 3010 to measure the total particle number concentration. The other flow was fed into a Cloud Condensation Nucleus counter CCNc , Droplet Measurement Technologies to characterize the coating thickness similarly done to, e.g., . The third flow was provided to LACIS. In the inlet section of LACIS, the aerosol flow is combined isokinetically with a humidified sheath air flow such that the aerosol forms a beam of approximately 2mm in diameter along the center line of the flow tube. Supersaturated conditions were achieved by cooling the tube walls, and resulted in activation of the particles to droplets, with each droplet containing one size-segregated particle. These droplets then froze due to further cooling. For detailed information about the operation mode of LACIS see.At the outlet of LACIS, TOPS-Ice thermally stabilized optical particles spectrometer was used to discriminate between frozen and unfrozen droplets and to quantify the frozen droplet fraction , as here an additional multiple charge correction was applied to the data see above . For the ATD data from no multiple charged particles were detected.Figure  2 shows the results of the immersion freezing experiments for illite-NX black and feldspar red . Additionally, data from previous LACIS studies concerning ATD dark yellow and Fluka kaolinite blue are shown. Since measurement setup and procedure, as well as the particle sizes 300nm were the same for all of the considered data, a direct quantitative comparison of who suggested that the K-feldspar content controls the freezing behavior of mineral dust particles. We will come back to this later in this chapter.Measured ice fractions of feldspar red and illite-NX black as a function of temperature. Additionally, data from ATD dark yellow and Fluka kaolinite blue are shown. a Uncoated particles and b particles coated with sulfuric acid circles: coating at 70°C; squares: coating at 80°C . Error bars are the standard deviation of the experiments and were obtained for temperatures with at least three measurements. For temperatures with fewer than three measurements, Poisson uncertainties are given. The gray line in both panels represents a fit curve through all the coated minerals except the feldspar coated at 70°C following the fit equation and are in good agreement. In the supporting information we show equations for. The gray line represents the baseline which we assume to represent clay minerals, without any K-feldspar. The fit equation of the gray line is suggested that the K-feldspar component controls the ice nucleation ability of mineral dusts. Consequently, assuming that the found that microcline was the most ice active mineral dust in deposition ice nucleation, compared to, e.g., illite, kaolinite but also to albite Na feldspar . So when trying to quantify heterogeneous ice nucleation induced by mineral dust, it is not only important to know the amount of K-feldspar, but it may also be essential to know which K-feldspar is actually present.It is worth mentioning that both microcline and orthoclase feature the same molecular formula KAlSi 3 hypothesized that the clear decrease in the ice nucleation ability after coating ATD particles with sulfuric acid originated from aluminum silicates which were transformed to non ice active metal sulfates. In view of the results of the present study, an alternative interpretation would be that the K-feldspar about 20 % orthoclase contained in the ATD was affected. Similar conclusions could be made based on the Fluka kaolinite data. reported that particles from the Fluka kaolinite sample blue symbols in Figure  2 which contained K-feldspar showed a reduced IN ability after coating with sulfuric acid, while another kaolinite sample which did not contain any feldspar KGa-1b from the Clay Minerals Society , featured a low IN ability to begin with which was not affected by the coating. Our illite-NX data allow for the same conclusion. The orthoclase present in the illite-NX sample may have been chemically altered, which then leads to the slightly lowered ice nucleation ability of illite-NX.Finally, when looking at the fully coated particles, it becomes obvious that all dusts fall together on a single line gray curve in Figures  2 a,   2 b, and Figure  3 , fit equations are given in the captions of both figures . This line may represent the ice nucleation ability of the “pure” clay minerals, i.e., the clay minerals without the feldspar. This implies that the ice nucleation behavior of the clay mineral proxies investigated is very similar and can be described/parameterized by a single fit equation. Nevertheless, it should be remembered, that the herein given for kaolinite and corroborates the findings of, who suggested that the K-feldspar is responsible for the high ice nucleation ability of some mineral dusts. Furthermore, a comparison of the composition of ATD, illite-NX and feldspar led us to the hypothesis that within the K-feldspars, microcline is more ice nucleation active than orthoclase. Microcline and orthoclase differ only by their lattice structure, this could be interpreted as a hint that at least for K-feldspars the lattice structure influences the ice nucleation ability. This implies that when trying to quantify heterogeneous ice nucleation induced by mineral dust, it is not only important to know the amount of K-feldspar, it may also be necessary to know which K-feldspar is present in the sample.Furthermore, we investigate how coating with sulfuric acid affects the ice nucleation ability of mineral dusts. For feldspar particles, we found a strong reduction of their ice nucleation ability. When considering sulfuric acid coated illite-NX this study , Fluka kaolinite and ATD particles, we found the decrease in ice nucleation ability of the respective mineral to be related to the K-feldspar content. This further corroborates that the ice nucleation behavior of mineral dusts may be controlled by the amount of K-feldspar being present. We also found that after coating with sufficient amounts of sulfuric acid, all investigated mineral dusts feature a similar ice nucleation ability. We hypothesize that the “remaining” ice nucleation ability is that of pure, feldspar free clay minerals, and that the ice nucleation ability is similar to all clay minerals.What exactly is destroyed on the surface of the feldspar particles by the sulfuric acid coating could not be clarified completely within this study. It is also unclear if the sulfuric acid affected only the surface of the individual particles, or if the bulk chemical properties were altered. Further chemical and/or mineralogical analyses are necessary to clarify this completely. This could be key to answering the question: “What makes a particle an effective ice nucleating particle?”."
32,dust aerosol ocean,"Identification of a new dust-stratocumulus indirect effect over the tropical North Atlantic. Over the tropical North Atlantic, during boreal summer, both stratocumulus clouds and mineral aerosols are ubiquitous. We find that low cloud fraction increases in response to high mineral aerosols loadings by 3% to 10% over much of the tropical North Atlantic, in International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project ISSCP and Pathfinder Atmosphere Extended PATMOSx observations. Using the single-column mode of the Community Earth System Model CESM , we estimate that this indirect effect nets a surface cooling of approximately -3 Wm -2 to -12 Wm -2 per unit of dust optical depth DAOD increase in mineral aerosols, similar to observed radiative forcings of -4 Wm -2 to -6 Wm -2 per unit of DAOD in ISSCP and PATMOSx. Increases in stratocumulus clouds are linked to increases in atmospheric stability, reductions in boundary layer height, and moistening of the lower atmosphere in response to increased dust load. Mineral dust is shown to behave similarly to other absorbing aerosols in indirectly forcing a response in stratocumulus clouds. Mineral dust is a key player in the variability of climate over the tropical Atlantic. The world's dominant source of mineral dust is the Sahara desert, from which huge quantities of mineral dust are transported over the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. Frequent, periodic dust events over the tropical North Atlantic alter the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity in the atmosphere and cool the surface ocean beneath it. Mineral dust impacts climate directly by absorbing and scattering incoming shortwave radiation as well as absorbing outgoing longwave radiation and indirectly through complex interactions with clouds, leading to changes in atmospheric structure and the surface ocean beneath it.Low, stratocumulus clouds are an important component of the radiation budget of the tropical North Atlantic Ocean, but their life cycle is strongly dependent upon atmospheric conditions. Clouds found near the surface are particularly important cooling agents for the region. The eastern tropical Atlantic is a region of widespread low cloud cover, including stratocumulus and trade cumulus clouds, prevalent in the summer seasons when mineral dust load nears its annual peak. Stratocumulus clouds are sensitive to the vertical structure of the atmosphere lower atmospheric stability and surface ocean conditions, which are also impacted by mineral dust. Warming and drying of the middle atmosphere, cooling and moistening of the boundary layer, and widespread subsidence are well-established conditions associated with high dust load and are also known to be important factors in the development of stratocumulus clouds. Aerosol-driven increases in low cloud cover would cool the tropical North Atlantic, an important aerosol-cloud indirect effect with potential ramifications for regional climate.Dust outbreaks increase stability of the atmosphere, leading to favorable conditions for stratocumulus cloud development, introducing the possibility of a novel indirect effect. The objective of this paper is to understand how changes in atmospheric structure resulting from mineral dust, impact the prevalence of stratocumulus clouds Sc . We call this low cloud response to aerosol forcing the Stratocumulus Indirect Effect ScIE . Conceptually, ScIE works as follows: 1 mineral dust perturbs the atmosphere, 2 Sc clouds increase in response to perturbations, 3 Sc perturbs the atmosphere and surface ocean, and 4 regional climate is impacted. ScIE represents a previously unidentified cooling mechanism for the surface ocean, and as regional climate is highly sensitive to sea surface temperature, could have significant implications for regional climate.Long-term cloud retrievals from weather satellites often suffer from poor long-term stability; changes in satellite solar zenith angle, drifts in satellite equatorial crossing time, and instrument calibration errors can introduce biases and spurious trends. Introducing artificial errors into cloud data can contaminate comparative studies over long periods. In this work we utilize cloud retrievals from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project ISCCP and Pathfinder Atmosphere Extended PATMOSx , which have been corrected to remove artifacts by regressing cloud anomalies and artifact factor anomalies of aforementioned error sources and treating the residuals as corrected cloud fraction anomalies J. R. Norris and A. T. Evan, Empirical removal of artifacts from the isccp and patmos-x satellite cloud records, submitted to and.In this work we test atmospheric response to dustlike conditions using Community Earth System Model CESM 1.2 and Community Atmosphere Model CAM 5 in single column mode SCAM . To represent typical summer like conditions in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean, we take observations from the Global Atmospheric Research Project Atlantic Tropical Experiment GATE III and force it with heat and moisture tendencies from. Temperature and specific humidity anomalies are taken from Figures 2 and 3 of, respectively. Heat and moisture tendencies are then calculated with a time scale of 1 day to replicate dustlike conditions. Two experiments are performed, in the first, heating/drying rates associated with a strong DAOD = 0.8 dust storm are applied to a 2 day interval, repeated for each 2 day window of the 20 day GATE III record. Results presented here are composited about the day of initial forcing. We refer to the first experiment as the“periodic case.” In the second experiment, weaker heating/drying rates DAOD = 0.5 are applied to the entire 20 day GATE III record, to replicate a dusty summer. We refer to the second experiment as the “steady case.” Forcing for the periodic case solid and steady case are shown in Figure  1 . In both cases a climatological sea surface temperature SST value is used, and the experiment conducted in the center of the tropical North Atlantic grid point nearest 21°N and 42°W . Stratocumulus fraction Sc% is defined as the maximum fraction of stratiform clouds below the boundary layer. For comparison with observations, the low cloud fraction from the ISSCP cloud simulator within SCAM is also reported here.Heat K s −1 , red and moisture g s −1 , green tendencies applied to SCAM for the periodic solid and steady dashed cases. Forcing is taken from and corresponds to region 1 closest to Africa and a DAOD of 0.8 for the periodic case and region 3 farthest from Africa and a DAOD of 0.5 for the steady case.Here we demonstrate a robust, widespread increase in low-level clouds coincident with high mineral dust load in observations. Low cloud fraction in ISSCP and PATMOSx cloud product were analyzed to determine stratocumulus cloud response to seasonal mineral dust loading. Boreal summer JJAS, June-July-August-September seasonal means of low cloud fraction were calculated for each year from 1983 to 2009, and one sigma composite difference was calculated by subtracting years with low dust optical depth from years with high dust optical depth, as determined in PATMOSx aerosol product, averaged over the tropical North Atlantic 10°N to 20°N; 30°W to 10°W . The 1 sigma composite difference in low cloud fraction is shown for PATMOSx in Figure  2 a and ISSCP in Figure  2 b. Two regions of statistically significant increases in response to increased mineral dust are evident, one adjacent to the coast of Africa extending from 12°N to 30°N, and a second region in the central tropical Atlantic extending toward the Caribbean. The 1 as shown in Figure  1 . To determine the temporal response to dust storms in the first experiment, a strong dust storm AOD 0.8 like forcing was applied 2 days, the model run 19 times with forcing applied iteratively for 2 day periods over a 20 day record. To replicate a dusty summer, in the second experiment the model was forced with steady heating and moisture profiles corresponding to low levels of dust AOD 0.5 for the duration of the experiment.Vertical profiles of temperature and specific humidity of the composite mean for 5 days after the onset of the forcing in the period case are shown in Figure  3 . In the periodic case a strong warming of nearly 2° relative to a dust-free run is observed just above the boundary layer, decreasing aloft and toward the surface. With maximal warming occurring above the boundary layer, this warming is apt to increase the vertical gradient of temperature and increase stability at the top boundary layer. Interestingly for the periodic case, a moistening of the entire lower troposphere is observed maximum moistening in the boundary layer , despite a strong drying forcing having been applied to represent dustlike conditions Figure  1 , potentially through a surface evaporation feedback or through reductions in precipitation. The increase in vertical temperature gradient and increases in moisture content are associated with an increase in cloud cover, both above and in the boundary layer. Changes in convective cloud fraction are small, with increases in stratiform cloud cover accounting for nearly all of the increase in total cloud cover. Stratiform and total cloud cover increase above and in the boundary layer, with maximum increases in cloud cover above the boundary layer. left Vertical profile of temperature °C, red and specific humidity g kg −1 , green for periodic case solid lines on composite day 5 after forcing was applied, relative to a control run and for the mean of steady case dashed lines relative to a control run. right Vertical profile of cloud fraction in periodic case solid and steady case dashed . Vertical domain corresponds to ISSCP domain of low clouds surface to 680 hPa . Color denotes cloud type: all clouds black , stratus red , and convective blue .The temporal response to the forcing is shown in Table  1 . For the period forcing case, while the forcing is applied days 0 to 2 , the Saharan Air Layer SAL warms more than the planetary boundary layer PBL , increasing vertical stability. In contrast, moisture in the PBL increases both during the forcing and after days 3 to 7 , remaining enhanced for 7 days following the onset of the forcing. The height and depth of the boundary layer decline during the 2 days of forcing and remain suppressed for 7 days following the onset of the forcing. The fraction of stratocumulus clouds is slightly depressed during the forcing but increases to nearly two standard deviations above control for days 3 to 7 following the onset of forcing. Overall, dustlike forcing results in a squashing of the height of the boundary layer, increases atmospheric stability at the boundary layer, and increased moisture in and above the boundary layer. As a result of these changes, stratiform cloud fraction increases both in and above the boundary layer, leading to increased low cloud fraction.Top rows show atmospheric response to dustlike forcing, temperature .. We find a radiative forcing from ScIE per unit dust ∂ RF ∂ DAOD of −12.19 Wm −2 DAOD −1 for our periodic forcing case and −6.86 Wm −2 DAOD −1 for our steady, seasonal case Table  2 . Radiative forcing from observations is found to be −5.81 Wm −2 DAOD −1 in ISSCP and −4.18 Wm −2 DAOD −1 in PATMOSx, through regression of all pairs of seasonally averaged low cloud fraction and dust optical depth over the tropical North Atlantic. The above calculations do not take into consideration the role of dust in changing the albedo of clouds, which could increase or decrease the radiative forcing per unit AOD.A sharp decadal decline in dust over the North Atlantic from the 1980s to the 2000s has been observed in both paleorecords and observations and models. Reductions of dust load over the North Atlantic would both directly increase radiation to the surface of the ocean through radiative forcing and also through reductions of the ScIE. Using an estimate of −4.5 Wm −2 DAOD −1 for ScIE and the observed decline in DAOD in PATMOSx, estimated reductions in ScIE from the 1980s to 2000s are about −4.5 Wm −2 along the coast of Africa, and −1.5 Wm −2 over much of the tropical North Atlantic, suggesting that a large fraction of observed warming here could be a result of declines in ScIE due to reduced dust load. However, the ScIE as defined here only considers low cloud responses to dust outbreaks, ignoring potential changes in middle and upper level clouds. It is unclear if dust-induced changes in middle or upper level clouds would be a warming or cooling effect and represents an open question for future work.Here we confirm previously observed coincidence of stratocumulus clouds and mineral dust over the tropical North Atlantic and the previously identified statistical link between dust load and stratocumulus clouds. More generally, we show that dust can behave like other absorbing aerosols in indirectly forcing a response in stratocumulus clouds. In doing so, this work supports the findings of and who found an increase in low clouds when absorbing aerosols top a stratocumulus-capped boundary layer. Overall we demonstrate observational and modeling evidence for a robust stratocumulus indirect effect in response to mineral dust outbreaks and quantify the radiative forcing. This so-called dust ScIE has potentially large implications for regional climate."
34,dust particles aerosol,"Laboratory chamber measurements of the longwave extinction spectra and complex refractive indices of African and Asian mineral dusts. In this study we present the first results from laboratory chamber experiments newly designed to investigate the longwave optical properties of mineral dust. Extinction spectra in the 2-16 mu m range have been measured in situ T=293K, RH<2% for polydispersed pure dust aerosols generated from natural parent soils from Tunisia, Niger, and the Gobi desert. Data are used in combination with particle size distributions to estimate the complex refractive index of each dust sample. Our results show that the magnitude and spectral dependence of the dust extinction and refractive indices differ according to particle mineralogy, suggesting the necessity for regionally resolved optical properties for modeling dust radiative effects in the longwave. The magnitude of extinction is controlled by the particle size distribution and remains significant down to low coarse particle concentrations, indicating that the longwave effect of mineral dust persists throughout long-range transport and is thus relevant at the global scale. The interaction of large mineral dust particles with longwave radiation has been demonstrated to have important implications for climate and remote sensing applications. For instance, the warming effect due to the absorption of longwave radiation by dust particles counterbalances a significant fraction of the shortwave cooling, thus modulating the overall dust radiative impact. Dust also directly affects satellite observations by modifying the top-of-atmosphere longwave outgoing radiance spectrum, which in turn influences the satellite retrieval of several key climatic parameters, such as sea surface temperature and greenhouse gases concentration.Currently, large uncertainties persist in the quantification of the dust longwave radiative effect and its associated impacts. One of the main reasons for this is the very poor knowledge of the dust optical properties in this region of the spectrum. In particular, the sensitivity study of Highwood et al . has demonstrated that the complex refractive index m  =  n − ik is the dominant uncertainty when trying to reproduce, by calculations, the brightness temperature observed from measurements during dust events.Dust optical properties in the longwave are strictly controlled by particle physicochemical properties e.g., composition, size, and shape . Dust is composed of several minerals, such as clays illite, kaolinite, smectite, chlorite , quartz, Ca-rich species calcite, dolomite, gypsum , feldspars orthose, albite , iron hematite, goethite , and titanium oxides, each characterized by its own absorption features in the longwave. The spectral dependence of dust absorption properties depends on the relative abundance and state of mixing of these minerals, while the magnitude of the dust-radiation interaction is strongly modulated by their size distribution. In addition, the band shape and position of resonant absorption peaks vary significantly with particle shape.The composition, size, and shape of dust particles vary in space and time depending on the soil mineralogy of the specific source area of emission, on wind speed and on physical and chemical aging during transport.A “dynamic” representation of dust optical properties as a function of the physicochemical properties of particles is thus necessary not only to evaluate the magnitude of the dust longwave effect at the global scale but also to represent it in climate models and satellite retrieval schemes.Since the 1970s, the technique most commonly used to estimate dust optical properties in the longwave has been the spectroscopy pellet technique, in which particles are dispersed and pressed in a KBr pellet and their reflectance or absorption spectra are measured. Spectra are then analyzed by means of an assumed optical theory to obtain the complex refractive indices of particles. The very few existing data on the absorption spectra and refractive indices obtained from measurements on natural samples indicate that the dust longwave optical properties largely vary depending on the physicochemical properties of particles. However, measurements with the pellet technique are performed on a single collection of particles with a single set of physicochemical properties and thus represent a “static” picture of the refractive index specific for that aerosol condition. Consequently, data from different studies are difficult to compare and the individual effects of composition, size, and shape on the particle optical properties are impossible to evaluate. Moreover, as the pellet technique requires one to mix the dust sample with KBr and then press the mixture to form the pellet, the size distribution of the analyzed sample may be inherently different from that of ambient dust aerosol.The capability of providing a dynamic characterization of the dust optical properties requires performing measurements with a defined and reproducible protocol, in an environment in which the physicochemical properties of particles can be actively varied. This implies making use of a laboratory simulation chamber where atmospheric conditions can be reproduced and particles can be generated, processed, and deposited under controlled conditions and where the physicochemical properties and longwave spectra of particles can be measured simultaneously.In this paper we present the first results of newly designed dust experiments conducted in the large volume 4.2 m 3 multiinstrumented CESAM atmospheric chamber French acronym for Experimental Multiphasic Atmospheric Simulation Chamber . The novelty of our experimental approach resides in the fact that the longwave extinction spectra are measured in situ using polydispersed mineral dust particles generated using a technique designed to mimic the sandblasting process responsible for the generation of dust in the real environment. This process results in the production of supermicron dusts, including particles as large as ~20 µm, which are the most efficient in interacting with longwave radiation. Compared to previous chamber studies, which have mostly looked at monodispersed submicron individual minerals often synthetic , this approach allows us to investigate dust-radiation interactions under more realistic conditions.We conducted experiments on dust aerosols generated from parent soils collected from major global source regions in the African Sahara and Sahel, and the Asian Gobi desert, each of which is characterized by different mineralogical compositions. Dust aerosols are injected into CESAM at high concentrations up to ~1000 µg m −3 , and then particles are left to sediment in the chamber until they reach <50–100 µg m −3 . At the same time, the evolution of their extinction spectra is measured with a Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectrometer. These conditions allow us to investigate the longwave extinction under conditions nearly equivalent to those ranging from dust storms nearby sources to transported plumes aerosol longwave optical depths from ~2 to ~0.2 .The schematic configuration of the CESAM setup for the dust experiments is shown in Figure S1 in the supporting information. Prior to each experiment, the chamber is evacuated and kept at the pressure of 10 −4  mbar. Then, the reactor is filled at one atmosphere with a mixture of 80% N 2 and 20% O 2 . Temperature and relative humidity are maintained constant at 293 K and <2% Vaisala probe HMP234 , respectively, during all experiments.As described in Alfaro et al ., dust aerosols are generated by mechanical shaking of natural soil samples, which reproduces the saltation and sandblasting processes responsible for the release of mineral dust in natural conditions. Approximately 60 g of soil and 60 g of pure quartz Fontainebleau, France are placed in a Buchner flask. The flask is first purged with pure N 2 Linde, nitrogen 4.5 for ~3–5 min to eliminate gaseous impurities; then, the soil/quartz mixture is shaken for 30 min at 100 Hz using a sieve shaker Retsch AS200 . The presence of the pure quartz grains increases the efficiency of the saltation/sandblasting process thus allowing a rapid generation of high dust concentrations. The suspension of dust particles released from the soil in the Buchner flask is then injected into the CESAM chamber over a period of 10–15 min by flushing the flask with N 2 at 10 L min −1 . Before entering CESAM, the air flow passes through a stainless steel cylinder of 61 cm height and 14 cm of diameter to remove, by gravitational settling, particles larger than ~15 µm at 50% efficiency, so to prevent any large quartz grains from entering the CESAM chamber. All connections are made using 1/2 inch silicon tubing TSI Inc. , which minimizes particle loss via electrostatic deposition.The suspension and homogeneity of the dust aerosols within the chamber is ensured by circulating the air using a four-wing stainless steel fan 32 cm diameter operating at 600 rpm located at the bottom of the chamber.Dust extinction spectra between 2.0 µm 5000 cm −1 and 16.0 µm 625 cm −1 are measured in situ in CESAM by a Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectrometer Bruker® Tensor 37 TM interfaced with a multipass cell. The spectrometer is equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled Mercury Cadmium Telluride detector and a Globar source. The multipass cell, which consists of three high reflectivity gold-coated mirrors with a base length of 2 m, is adjusted to achieve a total path length of 192 ± 4 m. The IR beam enters and exits the reactor by passing through ZnSe windows. Measurements are performed at 1 cm −1 resolution by coadding 158 scans over 2 min. The FTIR reference spectrum is acquired immediately before dust injection. Small amounts of water vapor and CO 2 in some cases entered CESAM during particle injection and partly contaminated the dust spectra below 7 µm. This does not influence the state of particles as the chamber atmosphere remained very dry relative humidity < 2% . Gas lines are removed by means of an automated software optimization routine; then the spectra are interpolated at 0.02 µm wavelength resolution.Particle number size distributions are acquired simultaneously with FTIR spectra from two Grimm® optical particle sizers OPS, Grimm Inc., model 1.109; 655 nm operating wavelength working in the diameter range 0.25–32 µm. The OPS sphere-equivalent optical diameters have been converted into sphere-equivalent geometrical diameters D g by taking into account the dust complex refractive index. In the absence of an independent estimate of the dust refractive index at 655 nm, the optical to geometrical diameter conversion has been performed based on the range of values reported in the literature for dust at visible wavelengths, i.e., n vis  = 1.42–1.56, with a mean of ~1.53 for the real part, and k vis  = 0.001–0.005 for the imaginary part. Optical calculations are computed using Mie theory for n vis  = 1.42, 1.53, and 1.56 by varying k vis at step of 0.001 between 0.001 and 0.005. D g has then been set at the mean ± one standard deviation of the values obtained for the different n vis and k vis . After conversion, the OPS diameter range became 0.28–72.2 µm with an associated uncertainty between 3 and 11.5%.One of the two OPS intakes was placed on the same horizontal plane as the FTIR spectrometer, while the second was placed ~50 cm below the FTIR level and at ~60 cm across the chamber from the first OPS. This arrangement was chosen to monitor possible inhomogeneity of the dust distribution within the chamber. Differences between the two OPS are consistently below 10%, which indicates that the dust distribution within the chamber is homogeneous. For the sake of clarity, only the measurements from the OPS located at the same height as the FTIR will be shown.The natural soil samples used in this study to generate dust correspond to the first few millimeters of soil which, in the real world, is the fraction subject to wind erosion. They were collected in the field with special care using a plastic shovel; after collection, they were stored in plastic containers. For this first study, we have selected three soils representative of some of the major global source areas worldwide:These soils, and so the corresponding aerosols, differ in their chemical and mineralogical compositions, as analyzed in Lafon and Lafon et al .. The Niger soil is rich in quartz and kaolinite clay, contains minor quantities of illite, and presents no traces of calcite; the Tunisian soil is very rich in calcite, enriched in illite with respect to kaolinite, and presents traces of quartz; the Chinese soil is rich in illite and presents traces of calcite but contains little quartz and kaolinite. Prior to use in CESAM, all soils were sieved to less than 1000 µm to eliminate any nonerodable grains. Information on samples analyzed in this study are provided in the supporting information Table S1 .Figure  1 shows the surface area size distribution µm 2  cm −3 and extinction coefficient β ext λ ,, and a mean particle dry deposition velocity of 1 cm s −1 , the depletion ratio obtained for particles of 10 µm diameter at 50 min would correspond to an atmospheric residence time of 5–6 days, which is a time scale typical of long-range intercontinental transport.The extinction spectra displayed in Figure  1 clearly show the contribution of dust scattering between 2 and 8 µm; above 8 µm, however, extinction is dominated by absorption. In this wavelength region, significant differences are observed in the spectra of the three dust samples. These, in turn, are associated with the differences in their mineralogical composition:The intensities of the dust extinction spectra depend strongly on the particle size distribution and in particular on the contribution from the aerosol supermicron fraction. For instance, the highest values ~0.45 × 10 −2  m −1 of both dust scattering below 8 µm and absorption in the 8–12 µm window spectral region are observed for the Niger aerosols, which are also the richest in supermicron particles 26% in number at the peak of the injection compared to the 17% and 12% for Tunisia and China aerosols . The spectral intensities rapidly decrease after injection, following the decrease of the supermicron number/mass particle concentration. The extinction spectra intensities are about halved after 20 min and reduced to 20–30% of their initial values after 50 min. The evolution of the dust extinction spectra with time as shown in these experiments may be taken as indicative of the changes which may occur during medium- and long-range transport if dry deposition is the dominant process.An optical inversion procedure was applied to retrieve the dust longwave complex refractive index m  =  n − ik from the size and extinction data obtained simultaneously in CESAM. Starting from the measured number size distribution, d N /dlog D g , the extinction coefficient, β ext λ can be recalculated as where Q ext m , λ , D g is the particle extinction efficiency. As the simplest approach, Q ext is computed using Mie theory for spherical particles. Our retrieval algorithm consists of iteratively varying m in expression 2 until β ext λ calc matches the measured β ext λ . However, as m is a complex number with two variables, an additional condition is needed. According to the electromagnetic theory, n and k must satisfy the Kramers-Kronig K-K relation: with ω the angular frequency of radiation ω  = 2π c / λ ,"" open="" VO72, rainout dust aerosols collected in Germany , Volz VO73, Saharan dust collected at Barbados, West Indie , Fouquart et al . FO87, Sahelian sand collected at Niamey, Niger , and the OPAC desert model.As a consequence of their differing mineralogies, the imaginary part of the refractive index varies significantly in magnitude for the Niger, Tunisia, and China aerosols. The largest differences are observed in the 8.5–10 µm range between the Niger dust k  ~ 0.3–0.9 and Tunisia and China dusts k  ~ 0.15–0.5 and k  ~ 0.3–0.65, respectively . This is mainly linked to the highest content in the Nigerian aerosols of quartz and kaolinite, highly absorbing at these wavelengths, compared to Tunisian and Chinese dusts, which are poorer in these minerals. Conversely, Tunisia and China aerosols show a very intense calcite-associated peak at 7 µm, which is not present in the k spectrum of Niger dust. Minor but detectable differences in the k spectra of the three samples curves are also present above 11 µm; these are attributable to minor absorption features of kaolinite, calcite, and quartz.The real part of the dust refractive index varies in the range 0.6–1.7 and presents its main signatures in correspondence of the absorption bands of clays and quartz at 8.5–10 µm, and calcite at 7 µm. The spectral behavior of n is very similar for the Tunisian and Chinese dusts throughout the whole considered range, while differences are observed with the Nigerian spectra especially below 12 µm.In Figure  2 , we compare the results of our analysis with values of the dust refractive index from Volz and Fouquart et al . obtained from pellet transmission measurements on natural dust samples and the values of the OPAC Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds database. We selected these studies because they are among the most widely used references in atmospheric and climatic studies, as well as in satellite inversion algorithms.The best agreement between CESAM and literature data is found with the measurements of Fouquart et al . for Sahelian dust, which on average better reproduce the magnitude of n and k in the whole range of wavelengths as obtained in our study reduced χ 2  ~ 2–43 for the different cases . Aside a poor spectral resolution, Fouquart et al . show in their k a clear signature due to kaolinite absorption at 11 µm, which we also observe in our Niger sample. A relative good agreement, only in the real part, is also obtained for Tunisia and China dust below 7 µm with data from Volz , which reproduce the signature of calcite at these wavelengths. A relatively weak correlation χ 2  ~ 7–22 is instead observed between our data and the data from Volz above ~8–9 µm, predominantly due to the shift of main clay absorption band at ~10 µm for this data set, and with OPAC χ 2  ~ 8–41 mainly above 11 µm, due to the strong contribution of quartz assumed in this dust model.Our results show clear signatures of the main mineral components of the different dusts. These signatures are not so apparent in the older studies shown in Figure  2 . In particular, clay and quartz bands appear strongly smoothed in the 8 and 11 µm region, where the maximum dust absorption is found. The quartz signal at 12.5–12.9 µm is not accurately estimated in all data sets underestimated in all studies with the exception of OPAC where it is considerably overestimated . The calcite band at 7 µm, as well as the small peak at 11.4 µm, whose contribution is of primary relevance for both Tunisia and China cases, is not at all present in the considered k reference data.In this paper, we present the first in situ laboratory measurements of the longwave extinction spectra and derived imaginary part of the complex refractive index of natural polydispersed dust particles from major source regions in Africa and Asia.The experiments were conducted in the CESAM chamber, which is characterized by a long optical path length ~192 m , an optimized dust generation system, and a particle lifetime comparable to that of dust in the atmosphere. This unique setup permits to measure dust extinction in a nearly realistic and dynamic environment, well representative of natural conditions. Owing to these features, the measured extinction spectra and dust refractive indices, made available as supporting information to this paper, are readily usable in radiative transfer and remote sensing applications without assumptions regarding particle size distribution and composition or corrections for multiple scattering.Our results for African and Asian dusts show that extinction spectra and refractive indices significantly vary as a function of particle origin and suggest that available literature data do not adequately represent this variability. Furthermore, our observation that the extinction signal persists down to low coarse particle fractions indicates that the dust-induced longwave radiative perturbation can be significant even for long-range transported dust and is potentially relevant at the global scale.Given these results, we suggest that both in satellite retrievals and in climate studies, research should move from the use of a single global value of the refractive index commonly that of the OPAC database toward the use of regionally resolved values. For the Saharan and the Gobi desert aerosols, for instance, we estimate lower absorption that in the OPAC database. Colarco et al . have recently shown that this lower absorption would reduce the top-of-atmosphere and surface longwave dust radiative effect all-sky at the global scale. The results of our study clearly respond to the evidence highlighted by these authors regarding the importance of better constraining the dust refractive index in order to improve our modeling capability.In addition, our data show very complex signatures of the extinction and refractive index spectra of dust, which are only in minor part reproduced in the coarse resolved OPAC model. A better spectral characterization of the dust optical properties is thus required to improve satellite retrievals, in particular for the new generation of very high resolution infrared sounders, i.e., the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder AIRS and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer IASI .This work represents a first step toward the provision of the dust regionally resolved and high-resolution refractive index data needed by climate and satellite applications. The approach and the results obtained here are promising, since we are able to resolve the main features of the dust refractive index as well as the differences between diverse source areas. However, two main aspects of the refractive index retrieval algorithm need to be improved to obtain more stable and constrained solutions. The first consists in providing an independent estimation of n vis , necessary both to correct the size distribution measurements in a more precise way and to force the n λ retrieval at low wavelengths. The second concerns the necessity of using, in place of the Mie theory, an optical model adapted to the irregular shape of dust particles. These issues will be investigated in future works to increase the accuracy and the applicability of our results."
368,dust aerosol ocean,"An analysis of aeolian dust in climate models. Aeolian dust is a key aspect of the climate system. Dust can modify the Earth's energy budget, provide long-range transport of nutrients, and influence land surface processes via erosion. Consequently, effective modeling of the climate system, particularly at regional scales, requires a reasonably accurate representation of dust emission, transport, and deposition. Here we evaluate African dust in 23 state-of-the-art global climate models used in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We find that all models fail to reproduce basic aspects of dust emission and transport over the second half of the twentieth century. The models systematically underestimate dust emission, transport, and optical depth, and year-to-year changes in these properties bear little resemblance to observations. These findings cast doubt on the ability of these models to simulate the regional climate and the response of African dust to future climate change. The emission and transport of aeolian dust is both influenced by—and influences—the Earth's climate. Dust emission is controlled by both terrestrial processes and near-surface winds, the latter of which is also responsible for the subsequent transport. Suspended dust radiatively cools the surface and warms the atmosphere via direct and indirect effects and in turn can alter regional winds and rainfall and thus the dust aerosol cycle. Dust acts as an external source of nutrients to the oceans and remote terrestrial ecosystems and alters the global carbon cycle. Therefore, with respect to simulations of the climate with model biases in dust emission, concentration and deposition likely result in biases in simulated energy and nutrient budgets, yet the representation of dust in state-of-the-art climate models has not yet been systematically evaluated.A major limitation in evaluating aeolian dust in climate models is the lack of high-quality and long-term measurements of dust. Satellite retrievals from which a dust concentration can be derived extend back to approximately 1980, but these data have uncertainties. Surface measurements of visibility can go back even further, but these are not purely indicative of dust aerosol nor are they always homogeneous in time. High temporal resolution proxy records of atmospheric dust are also a source of estimates of historical concentrations, but to date these data are few. Despite these shortcomings of existing mineral aerosol observations, there are a few robust data sets against which models can be evaluated. Among these we focus on observations indicating dust emission and transport from northern Africa, the world's largest dust source. We first examine the long-term mean dust aerosol concentration over an oceanic region west of northern Africa, 10°–20°N and 20°–30°W Figure S1 in the supporting information . We specify this region since it includes the island nation of Cape Verde for which a long proxy record of dust exists, although expanding this region eastward or northward has no substantive effect on the results presented here.We first compare distributions of the annual mean dust mass path DMP; g m –2 , which is the vertically integrated mass of atmospheric dust per unit area, from the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change CMIP5 models Table S1 against satellite retrievals of DMP from the advanced very high resolution radiometer AVHRR for 1982–2004 and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS Terra instrument for 2000–2013. MODIS retrieved and CMIP5 output total aerosol optical depth and fine mode optical depth were used to estimate dust optical depth τ d via Kaufman et al ., and AVHRR retrievals of total aerosol optical depth were converted to τ d via Evan and Mukhopadhyay . We note that for the CMIP5 models the fine mode fractions for anthropogenic, mineral, and marine aerosols were nearly identical to the values reported in Kaufman et al .. We conservatively estimated the uncertainty in the satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth to be 10% for MODIS and 15% for the AVHRR. For the satellites, τ d data were converted to DMP via the ratio of 2.7 ± 0.4 g m −2 per unit τ d Table  1 , which is based on the average of observations of this ratio. DMP is obtained directly from the ensemble means of the CMIP5 twentieth century historical simulations Table S1 . Two models CCSM and CESM only report τ d and not DMP; therefore, we calculated the ratio of τ d to DMP for this model using the CESM total aerosol mass fields in an overwater area where the aerosol loading is dominated by dust 2.2 g m −2 per unit τ d ; Table  1 . However, the inclusion of marine aerosols in the total aerosol mass field means that the τ d to DMP ratio of 2.2 is an upper bound on the actual ratio for the model and that the DMP estimates used here for CCSM and CESM are likely too high.For the CMIP5 data, the multimodel median DMP is 0.26 g m −2 , with individual model medians spanning 0.05 to 0.46 g m −2 Figure  1 a . In contrast, the median DMPs from the AVHRR and MODIS retrievals is 0.75 and 0.82 g m −2 , respectively, which is a factor of 3 larger than the multimodel median. Based on the uncertainty in the optical depth retrievals and in the τ d to DMP ratio, the uncertainty range on the satellite-retrieved DMP is approximately 0.6 to 1.0 g m −2 Figure  1 a, pink shading . Compared against individual models the median satellite-retrieved DMP is larger by a factor of 2 CCSM to 12 MIROC4h , and all models have a long-term median DMP that is smaller than the lower bound on the satellite-based DMP of 0.6 g m −2 . Furthermore, most CMIP5 models underestimate the width of the interquartile range, which is not surprising given the low bias in the mean state. We note that some models exhibit a very small range in DMP e.g., the IPSL models , and we speculate that this is because there is no year-to-year change in the modeled dust emission, and so changes in DMP are due to variations in advection and deposition only. However, we cannot verify this because emission data for these models were not available. a Long-term mean dust emission and mass path from satellite retrievals and CMIP5 models. Shown in Figure  1 a are box-and-whisker plots of the long-term annual mean dust mass path over the region 10°–20°N and 20°–30°W. Medians red lines , interquartile range blue boxes , the interquartile value ± 1.25 times the interquartile range black “whiskers” , and outliers red crosses are calculated from annual mean dust mass path values over the period 1982–2004 2000–2013 for the MODIS-Terra data . The multimodel median mass path is indicated by the red line. The red shaded regions indicate the uncertainty in the satellite estimates of long-term median DMP. b A scatterplot of annual mean DMP averaged over 10°–20°N and 20°–30°W ordinate and mean annual total dust emission from northern Africa abscissa , for CMIP5 models main plot and the AVHRR and MODIS inset , where error bars indicate the ± 1 σ range of these data. The linear regression of DMP onto emission is indicated by the red line, which is used to estimate the satellite-based emission values.To elucidate the source of the low bias in modeled dust mass path we calculated the long-term mean total dust emission Tg from northern Africa all of Africa north of the equator Figure  1 b , for the models for which emission data are available Table S1 . CMIP5 models' tropical North Atlantic DMP is directly proportional to the total northern African emission, the correlation coefficient of DMP and emission is 0.86 p value < 0.01 , and the slope of the linear regression is 1.64 ± 0.85 × 10 −5 g m −2 Tg −1 Figure  1 b, red line , where the uncertainty represents the 95% confidence interval on the regression coefficient. Given the tight fit between emission and concentration, it is likely that the biases in Figure  1 a are the result of dust emission biases and less to modeled transport and deposition, although they may also be related to model differences in transport related to different parameterizations of the dust size distributions or the representation of the dust size distributions in the atmosphere. If we estimate the total emission from northern Africa based on the linear fit between models' emission and mass path, but using the average mass path values from the satellites Figure  1 a , northern African dust emission is approximately 4500 ± 1500 Tg yr −1 Figure  1 b, inset , a factor of 3 greater than the multimodel mean emission from CMIP5 Figure  1 a .As observations of total northern African emission do not exist there is no way to evaluate the accuracy of these model- or satellite-based estimates. Thus, while the range of model values seen here is consistent with other analysis of model output, there is no a priori reason to reject the satellite estimates as being biased high. Kok found that the size distribution of dust at emission was biased toward small particles causing larger optical depth per unit mass τ and speculated that the resulting dust mass emitted is underestimated by a factor of 2 to 8. This may be an artifact of tuning the models to τ observations, and we find a very good agreement in the mean τ between the model ensemble of 0.34 and the satellite-retrieved 0.38 ± 0.05 Table  1 .However, τ is the sum of the contributions from different aerosol species, broadly categorized as marine τ ma , anthropogenic τ an , and dust τ d . MODIS retrievals of fine mode τ , nominally PM 1.0 , enable the separation of the MODIS and AVHRR τ into these three components. Several of the CMIP5 models also output fine mode τ Table S1 , which is also defined as PM 1.0 , and thus, we are able to use the same methodology in Kaufman et al . to separate the models' τ into these components see supporting information . The comparison of modeled and satellite-retrieved τ d shows less agreement than that for τ ; the mean satellite-retrieved τ d is 0.30 ± 0.04, and the multimodel mean τ d is 0.22 Table  1 . Eight CMIP5 models have a lower τ d minimum of 0.09 than the satellites, two models have a higher τ d 0.35 , and one model has a mean τ d that is within the MODIS and AVHRR uncertainty range.For the three models in which τ d is greater or equal to the satellite-retrieved τ d both MIROC models and the CSIRO-Mk3 , the total DMP bias Figure  1 a can be attributed to the size distribution of the emitted dust being too skewed toward small particles, as proposed in Kok . For the majority of models that have a mean τ d that is smaller than the satellite-retrieved τ d , the DMP bias can be attributed to both the dust size distribution bias and an underestimation of the total amount of dust emitted from northern Africa. In other words, a model can have a perfect representation of the dust size distribution and still underestimate the total mass flux because either the frequency of dust storms is too small or the mass flux per dust emission event is too small.We estimate that the percentage of the low bias in DMP that is due to the skewed size distribution is 100 % × min {1,  τ d ,MODEL / τ d ,MODIS } and that the percentage of the low bias in DMP that is due to an insufficient total flux is 100 % minus this value. From these calculations, and averaged across all models, 66% of the bias in DMP Figure  1 a is due to a bias in the emitted size distribution “Size bias” in Table  1 , and 34% of the bias in DMP is due to an underestimation of total northern African emission “Flux bias” in Table  1 .The low biases in emission Figure  1 b likely result from a number of factors, ranging from soil moisture content to vegetation cover to near-surface wind speed distributions. In an attempt to elucidate the causes of the model biases in emission and thus DMP we examined the spatial structure of surface emission across northern Africa in comparison to a satellite-derived map of emission frequency Figures S1 and S2 . Although the analysis did not provide any obvious clues for the causes of the biases, the level of disagreement between the models, between the models and observations, was stark, suggesting that the biases in emission likely result for a variety of reasons that are not necessarily consistent among the models.We also examined the time evolution of DMP from CMIP5 models to evaluate the interannual variability. Here we use a hybrid satellite paleorecord of annual mean τ d corresponding to a location adjacent to the Cape Verde islands 15°N and 23°W, Figure S1 that spans 1955–2009 Figure  2 a and compute mass path in a manner identical to that for the AVHRR data in Figure  1 a. One major feature of the observational time series is the increase of τ d over the tropical North Atlantic from the 1950s through the early 1980s and then a subsequent decline of emission and τ d through the 2000s Figure  2 a , which is documented in satellite and in situ data sets. Although the cause of these trends is still debatable, a number of papers have shown that they are either directly or indirectly caused by the simultaneous changes in summertime Sahelian rainfall, and in particular the severe drought of the 1980s, although new work has shown these trends to be only the result of a “slowdown” of the surface winds over the Sahara. The observed coefficient of the regression is −0.06 ± 0.04 g m −2 mm −1 d −1 , which is statistically different from zero at the 95% significance level Figure  2 b . Using the models' rainfall rates and DMP for the same years Figure  2 b , only the MIROC-ESM-CHEM has a negative regression coefficient that is statistically different from zero at the 95% level Figure  2 b . Consistent with our findings, a recent study found that a subset of the models evaluated here exhibited a negative correlation between DMP over the tropical North Atlantic and the phase of the modeled Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in twentieth century historical forcing runs, although the change was not determined to be statistically significant.We also compared annual mean DMP from AVHRR retrievals to model output for the CMIP5 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project simulations for the years 1982–2006. From a Taylor diagram, none of the models B-L in Figure  2 c exhibit a statistically significant and positive correlation to the data A in Figure  2 c , where the multimodel mean and median correlation coefficients are both less than zero. Also, the root-mean-squared biases are similar in magnitude to the observational data's standard deviation, indicating a complete lack of correspondence between the model output and satellite retrievals. Similar results are found when comparing the proxy DMP data and model output from the historical forcing runs for 1960–2004 Figure S2 .Based on the results presented here CMIP5 models are unable to capture any of the salient features of northern African dust emission and transport. The exact nature of the biases are not elucidated here but are likely to be related to a variety of sources, including the dust size distributions and atmospheric and surface processes. We conclude that there is no reason to assume that the projections of dust emission and concentration for the 21st century have any validity. Despite highlighting deficiencies in the representation of the multitude of land and atmospheric processes that govern dust emission, these results also cast doubt on the representation of other features of coupled Earth system that are affected by aeolian dust, including regional land and ocean surface temperatures, precipitation and cloud processes, coupled equatorial processes, and terrestrial and oceanic biogeochemistry. It is likely that the representation of dust in climate models can be improved by increasing the number and quality of observations of dust emission and atmospheric mass concentration in order to improve understanding of the processes affecting dust emission."
35,climate aerosol,"Positive response of Indian summer rainfall to Middle East dust. Using observational and reanalyses data, we investigated the impact of dust aerosols over the Middle East and the Arabian Sea AS on the Indian summer monsoon ISM rainfall. Satellite and aerosol reanalysis data show extremely heavy aerosol loading, mainly mineral dust, over the Middle East and AS during the ISM season. Multivariate empirical orthogonal function analyses suggest an aerosol-monsoon connection. This connection may be attributed to dust-induced atmospheric heating centered over the Iranian Plateau IP , which enhances the meridional thermal contrast and strengthens the ISM circulation and rainfall. The enhanced circulation further transports more dust to the AS and IP, heating the atmosphere positive feedback . The aerosols over the AS and the Arabian Peninsula have a significant correlation with rainfall over central and eastern India about 2 weeks later. This finding highlights the nonlocal radiative effect of dust on the ISM circulation and rainfall and may improve ISM rainfall forecasts. The interannual and seasonal variability of the Indian summer monsoon ISM rainfall is extremely important for the large population in this region. A number of factors contribute to this variability, such as sea surface temperature SST , El Niño–Southern Oscillation ENSO , and snow cover. In recent years, the impact of aerosols, including their direct and indirect effects on the ISM system, has received increasing attention.Anthropogenic black carbon and other man-made aerosols, which show an increasing trend in Asia in recent decades, may reduce ISM rainfall by exerting a surface cooling effect over the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. This aerosol-induced cooling effect through scattering and absorbing solar radiation results in a reduced north-south land-sea thermal contrast and a weaker meridional monsoon circulation the solar dimming effect . Bollasina et al . attributed the observed ISM drying trend over central-northern India in the past 60 years mainly to human-influenced aerosols. The importance of non-Asian anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions in suppressing ISM rainfall was also reported. The above studies addressed the impacts of aerosols on suppressing ISM rainfall on the decadal timescales. However, more and more studies found that aerosols could strengthen ISM on the interannual or seasonal timescales. Wang et al . showed that the heating initiated by absorbing aerosols within the planetary boundary layer can increase subcloud layer moist static energy and ISM rainfall. Lau et al . postulated that the thermal heating over the Tibetan Plateau, which is exacerbated by heat-absorbing black carbon emissions on the southern slopes of the Tibetan Plateau, acts like an elevated heat pump EHP that can advance and intensify ISM rainfall. It should be pointed out that the EHP mechanism has been subject to debate, mainly because it has little observational support. Furthermore, the impact of aerosols on strengthening ISM was also reported on the subseasonal timescales. Bollasina et al . found that anthropogenic aerosols were likely responsible for the observed earlier onset of the ISM.The majority of the aforementioned studies focus primarily on the impacts of anthropogenic or biomass burning emissions over land on the ISM system; much less attention has been paid to natural aerosols, especially mineral dust. Wang et al . studied the contribution of dust aerosols to the total absorbing aerosol optical depth AOD and found that dust aerosols were equal to anthropogenic aerosols in terms of absorbing solar radiation over the Indian subcontinent and nearby regions. Kuhlmann and Quaas examined the vertical profile of various kinds of global aerosols using the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation CALIPSO data set and concluded that heavy dust loadings were observed over the Arabian Sea AS with up to 80% of the measurements detecting either dust or polluted dust.The AS and the Middle East have heavy dust loadings during the ISM season Figure  1 . Several dust-active regions are present in our domain: the southern Arabian Peninsula AP , the AS, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The dust aerosols over the AS are transported from land. Over the last decade, the AS and AP have shown the greatest increasing aerosol concentration trend during the boreal summer. Despite the remarkable potential importance of aerosols over the Middle East and the AS in influencing the ISM system, less attention has been focused on it than on anthropogenic aerosols over India and the Tibetan Plateau, especially on timescales shorter than 1 month. Rahul et al ., using 4 years of AOD data sets, reported positive and negative AOD anomalies over the AS during the recent Indian normal and drought years, respectively. Evan et al . attributed the intensified AS tropical cyclones to aerosols over the AS. Very lately, Vinoj et al . showed a positive correlation between West Asian dust and ISM rainfall over timescales of about a week and attributed this correlation to dust-induced heating of the atmosphere over North Africa and West Asian. On the other hand, the thermal forcing of the Iranian Plateau IP also plays a significant role in the ISM evolution. Wu et al . found that the thermal forcing of the IP dominates the northern part of the ISM system. Iqbal et al . demonstrated that the south Asian heat low extending to the IP exerts a dominant impact on ISM rainfall over central India. Therefore, examining the direct radiative effect of dust aerosols over the IP and AS on the ISM system can lead to a better understanding of the dust-monsoon interaction.Spatial distribution of climatological mean 2000–2013 of seasonal AOD at 550 nm and 850 hPa winds in the ISM region. Results are shown for a spring MAM , b summer JJA , c fall SON , and d winter DJF . Aerosols are from MISR level-three monthly satellite data, and winds are from MERRA monthly reanalysis data. The grey colors represent missing values. The red boxes in Figure  1 b are regions for further analysis.In this paper, we provide observational evidence for a different mechanism from Vinoj et al . to address the response of ISM rainfall to dust aerosols over the AS and the Middle East on weekly timescales, using data from long-term 2000–2013 satellite AOD observations and atmospheric reanalyses. This new mechanism sheds further light on the interactions among dust, radiative forcing, and ISM and providing more quantitative estimates of the timescales of those interactions.Monthly gridded level-three AOD data sets retrieved by the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer MISR 0.5° × 0.5° and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS 1° × 1° both onboard the Terra satellite and daily AOD from MODIS onboard the Aqua satellite 1° × 1° are used to study the aerosol-monsoon interaction. Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate MACC 0.5° × 0.5° reanalysis data of partial AOD of various aerosol types, developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF 0.5° × 0.5° are also used. For rainfall data, we used Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission TRMM monthly 3B43 and daily 3B42 both version 7 data 0.25° × 0.25° and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA Precipitation Reconstruction over Land PREC/L 1° × 1° . The TRMM product merged the surface rain gauge data and satellite estimates, and NOAA's PREC/L merged only the gauge observations over land. Zonal and meridional wind components obtained from Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications MERRA 1/2° × 2/3° reanalysis is compared for consistency with ECMWF Interim Reanalysis ERA-Interim 0.5° × 0.5° . The HadlSST1 data set was used to calculate Niño 3.4 SST index. All the data used are for the period of 2000–2013, except for Aqua-MODIS AOD and MACC reanalysis data sets, which are for the period of 2003–2013. All data sets used in this study are available in the supporting information Text S3 .Multivariate empirical orthogonal function MV-EOF analysis, also referred to as combined principal component analysis PCA with two or more field variables combined in the same PCA, is a useful tool for isolating coupled patterns of variability among multiple fields. In this study, AOD, thickness between two pressure levels, zonal and meridional wind components, and rainfall are combined to perform MV-EOF analysis, in an attempt to unveil the physical mechanism responsible for the aerosol-rainfall connection. Each variable was standardized by its mean standard deviation so that the variance of the different variables was comparable in the MV-EOF analysis. Meanwhile, each variable maintains its original spatial distribution of variance.Figure  1 shows the spatial distribution of climatological mean 2000–2013 of seasonal MISR AOD at 550 nm and MERRA 850 hPa winds. In our study domain, boreal spring March–April–May MAM and summer June–July–August JJA are high-aerosol seasons; fall September–October–November SON and winter December–January–February DJF show much less aerosol. In MAM, high-aerosol concentrations are observed over the AP, the Indian subcontinent, and the Taklamakan Desert. In JJA, higher than MAM aerosol concentrations are observed over the AP, the AS, the IP, Pakistan, the Indian subcontinent, and the Taklamakan Desert. In fall and winter, relatively low aerosol concentrations are found in the northern Indian subcontinent along the Himalayas. The AOD over the AS and IP has much greater seasonality than over central and eastern India CEI Text S1 .One interesting phenomenon is that the AOD over water bodies, such as the Red Sea and the AS, is higher than over the adjacent land regions, such as the AP and the Indian subcontinent. A possible cause is aerosol humidification. Both theoretical investigations and field experiments show that water vapor can strengthen the aerosol's light scattering ability, thus resulting in higher AOD. The relatively weak wind over the northern AS Figure  1 b can also promote aerosol accumulation in these areas, resulting in high AOD values. Furthermore, minimal washout of aerosols by rainfall over the AS may also contribute to high AOD values.Using MACC aerosol reanalysis data, the contributions of various aerosol types to the total AOD are shown in Figure S1 . The aerosol model in MACC includes five aerosol types: mineral dust, sulfate, sea salt, organic matter, and black carbon. Mineral dust aerosols dominate the study domain, especially over the Red Sea, the AP, the AS, Pakistan, northwest India, and the Taklimakan Desert. Mineral dust contributes 53% of the total AOD over the AS and IP. Using CALIPSO, Kuhlmann and Quaas found that 80% of measurements are either dust or polluted dust aerosols over the northwest AS 60–65°E, 20–25°N . Both MACC and CALIPSO data sets show that mineral dust produces the greatest amount of AOD over the AS and IP. The other four aerosol types contribute much less to the total AOD over the AS and IP: 28% for sulfate, 12% for sea salt, 5% organic matter, and 2% black carbon.In order to demonstrate the spatiotemporal connections between aerosols, atmospheric circulation, and ISM rainfall, MV-EOF was performed on AOD, thickness between 500 and 700 hPa pressure levels, winds, and rainfall in JJA from 2000 to 2013. According to the hypsometric equation, the thickness between two pressure levels is proportional to the average air temperature between them.The leading mode of MV-EOF analysis shows the strongest positive AOD anomalies over the AS and the southern AP with 0.7 to 0.8 standard deviation from the mean Figure  2 a . Less strong 0.3 to 0.4 standard deviation positive anomalies appear over the IP in most areas of Iran and Pakistan, western and southern Afghanistan, and the regions north to Iran and Afghanistan. Figure  2 b shows a center of strong heating in the lower troposphere between 700 and 500 hPa around the IP with more than 1 standard deviation from the mean. This heating center extends farther southward to the AS. Corresponding to the heating gradient are enhanced southwesterly and northwesterly winds over the AP and AS, respectively, with about 1 standard deviation from the mean Figure  2 c . The enhanced southwesterly wind can transport increased water vapor from the AS to the Indian subcontinent, contributing to a stronger monsoon and more increased rainfall Figure  2 c . On the other hand, the enhanced northwesterly wind can generate more dust aerosols over the IP and transport these dust aerosols to the AS and IP to be shown later , forming a positive feedback. Figure  2 d shows the time series associated with the leading MV-EOF mode, AOD monthly anomaly over the AS and IP, and the rainfall monthly anomaly over CEI. All three time series show weak positive trends. The trend for AOD is most significant and has been found in other studies. The time series of the leading MV-EOF is significantly correlated with both AOD r  = 0.67 and rainfall r  = 0.64 . Similar results are also found in ERA-Interim and NOAA PREC/L data sets not shown . This connection between rainfall and aerosol can be confirmed by a simple correlation analysis of the area-averaged rainfall in CEI and AOD over the AS and IP r  = 0.46 ; the spatial distributions of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient are included in Text S2 . The coupled patterns among AOD, thickness, winds, and rainfall in the leading mode of MV-EOF suggest a connection between dust aerosols over the AS and IP and atmospheric heating in the lower troposphere, which may be responsible for the enhanced ISM circulation and rainfall.Leading MV-EOF spatial patterns for JJA 2000–2013 monthly a AOD, b thickness between 700 and 500 hPa pressure levels, and c TRMM rainfall and MERRA 850 hPa winds and d their associated time series bars . See section 2 for details. The monthly anomalies of AOD over the AS and IP R2 in Figure  1 b: 10–40°N, 55–70°E and rainfall over CEI R3 in Figure  1 b: 20–32°N, 75–90°E are also shown. All data are standardized. The grey color in Figure  2 a represents missing values.ISM rainfall has been shown to be correlated with ENSO. No significant correlation exists between time series of the leading mode of MV-EOF and ENSO; however, a significant correlation coefficient of 0.51 is found between the time series of the second mode and ENSO not shown . Therefore, the leading mode Figures  3 is likely to be driven by the aerosol anomaly, and the second mode is associated with ENSO.Zonal mean 55–70°E of air temperature differences for each pressure level between 14 months with the highest AOD in the order of AOD from low to high: 2011/08, 2013/06, 2013/07, 2009/08, 2012/07, 2006/07, 2009/07, 2010/07, 2008/06, 2008/07, 2011/07, 2011/06, 2001/07, and 2003/07 and 14 months with the lowest AOD in the order of AOD from low to high: 2007/08, 2005/06, 2005/08, 2006/06, 2000/08, 2002/08, 2000/06, 2001/08, 2002/06, 2007/06, 2004/06, 2006/08, 2012/06, and 2012/08 of total 42 JJA months in 2000–2013. Results are shown for a MERRA and b ERA-Interim. The black dots highlight the differences that are confident at 95% level, which are determined by a bootstrap test of sampling the data during the 42 JJA months for 10,000 times. Unit: K.Note that the location of maximum heating and maximum AOD are slightly different. This is due to the high surface albedo over the IP, which can enhance aerosol-induced atmospheric heating by reflecting more solar radiation to dust layers above than the sea surface. Another potential reason for the location difference is the high atmospheric heating efficiency over land due to low water vapor content.We further studied this heating effect by performing composite analyses. First, 14 months with the highest and 14 with lowest AOD values over the IP 25–40°N, 50–70°E based on MISR monthly AOD were selected from the 42 JJA months of 2000–2013. The time-averaged zonal mean 55–70°E differences of monthly temperature anomalies between these two sets of 14 months were calculated for different pressure levels and shown in Figure  3 . We used temperature data from both MERRA and ERA-Interim reanalysis. Although none of them includes variable aerosols in their reanalysis model, the upper air temperature variations should be captured by assimilating data from weather balloons. Both MERRA and ERA-Interim show strong and significant heating over the IP and relatively weaker heating in the lower troposphere over the AS. The heating in the upper troposphere is not significant because of the large variance of temperature there. The meridional thermal gradient increases more in the upper troposphere than in the lower troposphere, which is consistent with the general findings of Dai et al . on Asian monsoons.Based on the above analyses, we propose a physical mechanism that may be responsible for the aerosol-rainfall connection. Aerosol-induced atmospheric heating over the IP and AS may intensify the meridional thermal contrast and lead to stronger southwesterly winds over the AS; these winds can transport more water vapor from the AS to the Indian subcontinent and increase ISM rainfall in CEI. The enhanced thermal contrast may also lead to stronger northwesterly winds over the AP, producing and transporting more dust aerosol to the IP and AS. Thus, a positive feedback loop may exist, which strengthens the effect. To verify the aerosol's transport pathways and its effect on rainfall, cross correlations were performed between winds over the AP, AOD over the AS and IP, and rainfall over CEI Figure  4 . Because it takes time for dust to travel from the AP to the AS and IP and to influence rainfall via the above mentioned mechanism, lagged correlations are also calculated. The red curve in Figure  4 shows that the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between wind over the AP and AOD over the AS and IP reach a peak when wind leads AOD by 3 days. For AOD and rainfall, the lead time for the strongest correlation is 13 days; for wind and rainfall, the lead time is 17 days. The lead time between wind and AOD roughly equals to the sum of the other two, indicating that the processes are almost sequentially connected. Note that the region for AOD includes both AS and IP R2 in Figure  1 b ; if using AOD over IP, the results are similar except that the peak correlation between wind and AOD is lower but still significant Figure S3 . These lagged relationships between winds, AOD, and rainfall further confirm the mechanism discussed above, because if their variations are caused by other common factors e.g., SST , they are not very likely to have such lagged relationships.Cross Spearman rank correlation coefficients between 2 m winds amplitude over the AP R1 in Figure  1 b: 15–30°N, 45–55°E , AOD over the AS and IP R2 in Figure  1 b: 10–40°N, 55–70°E , and rainfall over CEI R3 in Figure  1 b: 20–32°N, 75–90°E . All correlations are calculated based upon daily anomalies obtained by substracting the 19 day running mean from the daily data. Two dash lines represent the 95% confidence intervals, which are calculated by a bootstrap test of permuting the original time series for 10,000 times. The intervals change with time lag because of the decreasing of sample sizes. Different pairs of time series have similar confidence intervals and those from one pair are shown here.High AOD values about 0.49 were observed over the AS and IP in JJA in independent satellite retrievals. The high AOD values over the AS coincides with a wetting trend over this region, implying a possible positive relationship between AOD and rainfall, but a simple Spearman rank correlation analysis Figure S4 shows no significant correlation between AOD and rainfall. The MV-EOF analysis Figures  2 c and 2 d points to the dominant role of moisture flux on rainfall in this region. The AOD over the AS and IP starts to increase in MAM, reaches a peak in JJA, begins to decrease in SON, and sustains at a very low level in DJF. The overlap of the AOD peak period with the ISM season provides the possibility that dust aerosols over the Middle East and the AS may influence ISM rainfall.The connection between aerosols over the AS and IP and rainfall over CEI was studied using MV-EOF. Responding to positive AOD variability over the AS, the IP, and adjacent areas, strong atmospheric heating centered over the IP was observed in the lower troposphere resulting in enhanced southwesterly and northwesterly wind anomalies over the AS and AP, respectively. The enhanced southwesterly winds over the AS can transport more water vapor to the Indian subcontinent, causing a positive rainfall anomaly over CEI. Meanwhile, since the dust emission highly depends on wind speed in the AP, the enhanced northwesterly winds generate and transport more dust from the AP to the AS and IP, forming a positive feedback loop. This dust-monsoon interaction mechanism is similar to the “EHP” effect but is located over the IP.The cross-correlation analyses not only confirm the dust-monsoon connections but also characterize the timescales of these connections. The timescale of surface wind over the AP affecting AOD over the AS and IP is about 3 days; for AOD-rainfall over CEI , the timescale is about 13 days; for wind-rainfall, it is about 17 days. These lagged relationships may contribute to a more accurate ISM rainfall forecast.One issue of this study is that multiple factors can influence the ISM system. Although MV-EOF can capture the spatiotemporal connection of various components, it is difficult using observational data alone to isolate and quantify the contribution of each individual component to the ISM system. Vinoj et al . studied the impacts of various aerosol types on ISM rainfall using a global climate model. They attributed the observed positive correlation between AOD over the AS, West Asia, and the AP and ISM rainfall to dust-induced atmospheric heating and associated large-scale convergence over North Africa and the AP, which result in an increased moisture transport to India within a week. Our observation-based study shows an EHP effect located over the IP and its surrounding areas, which results in a heat low that may be responsible for the intensified ISM circulation and rainfall. Satellite data sets show very limited aerosols in Egypt, Sudan, and Libya in North Africa but higher AOD over the IP, the AP, and the AS. Therefore, it is more likely that the EHP located over the IP due to dust aerosols is responsible for this dust-monsoon correlation. Our future work will involve the use of high-resolution regional climate models coupled with chemistry to test the proposed physical mechanism that explains how the dust aerosols in the Middle East and IP influence the ISM system. Because dust loading has increased considerably during the last decade over the AP, the AS, and the IP, our findings may provide guidance for studying aerosol-rainfall interactions on longer timescales."
5,climate,"The role of the atmospheric electric field in the dust-lifting process. Mineral dust particles represent the most abundant component of atmospheric aerosol in terms of dry mass. They play a key role in climate and climate change, so the study of their emission processes is of utmost importance. Measurements of dust emission into the atmosphere are scarce, so that the dust load is generally estimated using models. It is known that the emission process can generate strong atmospheric electric fields. Starting from the data we acquired in the Sahara desert, here, we show for the first time that depending on the relative humidity conditions, electric fields contribute to increase up to a factor of 10 the amount of particles emitted into the atmosphere. This means that electrical forces and humidity are critical quantities in the dust emission process and should be taken into account in climate and circulation models to obtain more realistic estimations of the dust load in the atmosphere. Airborne dust and other aerosol particles affect the climate by absorbing and scattering thermal and solar radiation and acting as condensation nuclei for the formation of clouds. Thus, they strongly influence the atmospheric thermal structure, balance, and circulation. The wind-driven blowing of sand and dust is also responsible for shaping planetary surfaces through the formation of sand dunes and ripples, the erosion of rocks, and the creation and transport of soil grains. These processes occur not only on Earth but also on Mars, Titan, and Venus.It is clear that knowledge of the atmospheric dust properties and of the mechanisms of dust settling and rising into the atmosphere is a key to understanding the planetary climate and the interaction between the atmosphere and surface.During the Climate Change Conference in 2014, it was highlighted that aerosols contribute the largest uncertainty to the total climate forcing estimate for the Earth. The dust tridimensional distribution and number size distribution are among the most uncertain and critical parameters that need to be estimated. Current models are still inadequate in predicting these values correctly, in particular the abundance and size distribution of the dust emitted into the atmosphere. Estimates of emissions obtained by recent models span over a factor larger than 2. This translates into great uncertainties in the estimation of the dust impact on the climate radiative forcing and in understanding past and predicting future climate changes. On Earth, dust is lifted into the atmosphere mainly through wind drag, in a process named observed positive E-fields during a dust storm in Mitzpe Ramon Israel in February 2015. Nevertheless, negative E-fields have also been reported by other authors. Our observation is in contrast with the idea that the transfer of electric charge between particles during collisions saltation, sandblasting, etc. is exclusively a size-dependent process. This could evidence that the grain composition plays a key role in the charge transfer, too, as was also suggested by other authors. As an example, predicted that when the E-field intensity exceeds a certain threshold, it produces a significant reduction of the static threshold friction velocity necessary for the saltation process to occur. This, in turn, causes a sudden increase in the concentration of saltating particles at a given wind speed Figure 4 and a nonlinear increase of the E-field around this electric lifting threshold Figure 4 . The authors also predicted that by increasing the concentration of saltating grains, electric forces can lead to a reduction of the particle speeds. The effect of these two concurrent effects on the ejection of dust aerosol has never been investigated in the field. Our data, including simultaneous measurements of the wind, dust abundance, and electric field, has been used to explore this issue. left Suspended dust mass concentration and right atmospheric E-field as a function of the wind friction velocity Figure 4, left for dust storm events with RH in the range 10–30%.We derived the friction velocity u * directly from the three orthogonal components of the wind, u , v , and w , as measured from the CSAT3 3-D anemometer at 4.5 m: u * = u ′ w ′ ¯ 2 + v ′ w ′ ¯ 2 1 / 4 . Considering that the vertical variation of u * with height can be assumed to be negligible in the surface layer, we use this measured u * value as the friction velocity value at the surface more details are presented in the supporting information .As in the simulations performed by Kok and Renno a conductive soil due to the absorption of conducting films of water is assumed, we considered only storms in a “wet” environment RH > 10% . We also excluded from this analysis events with an RH higher than 30%, as they are peculiar events probably microbursts . We averaged the total mass concentration of dust grains obtained from the total number of grains, considering a typical bulk density of 2.7 g/cm 3 in bins of u * with a step of 0.02 m/s. The results are shown in Figure 4 .The dust mass concentration increases with u * with a power law Q  ∝  u * 3.6 ± 0.4 in line with the theoretical predictions up to a threshold of approximately 0.57 m/s, where it experiences an abrupt increase that can be observed correspondingly in the E-field behavior. Note that the saltation threshold for the studied events has an average of 0.22 ± 0.07 m/s see supporting information .Kok and Renno showed that this sudden increase in the particle load is not predicted by lifting models that do not include electric forces in their formulation. By exceeding the threshold, our data show an increase of approximately an order of magnitude in the mass concentration of the lifted dust.Note that Kok and Renno and other authors found that to significantly affect the particle lifting, the E-field should exceed 150 kV/m. This high field intensity was measured at a very short distance from the sand bed few centimeters and thus cannot be compared with our measurements performed at 2 m from the ground where E-field was found to be <20 kV/m .Even if other interpretations could be found, our results provide strong evidence that electric forces play a key role in the dust-lifting process. It suggests the utmost importance of including their contribution in dust entrainment models to improve dust load predictions due to their effect on the atmospheric thermal structure and in general on the climate of the planet.We performed field campaigns in the Sahara desert during the dust storm season in 2013 and 2014. The acquired data are unique in the literature and help to elucidate the complex relation between the saltation and lifting processes and the electric properties and the environmental parameters of the atmosphere. We found that a the particle emission process causes particles to be electrically charged and produces strong atmospheric electric fields up to 20 kV/m as measured at 2 m from ground ; b in contrast with models that predict upwardly directed E-fields, we generally observe downward fields same sign as fair weather E-field . This may suggest that the charging process does not depend only on the grain size but also on the grain composition; c there is a very strong and fast feedback between sand / dust emission and electric field enhancement; d there is a linear relation between the concentration of lifted dust and the generated electric field, with the slope increasing upon exceeding a critical RH and soil moisture; and e we propose the existence of a threshold in the E-field intensity that, if exceeded, leads to a positive and abrupt effect in the emission of dust, with the mass concentration increasing by a factor of 10.All these results highlight the key roles of electrification and humidity in the dust emission process. As a consequence, it is important to include these components in the models to adequately estimate the concentration of emitted dust and its strong effect on the climate.Understanding the physical processes acting during dusty events on the Earth is an important step to shedding light on similar phenomena on Mars. In March 2016, the ExoMars space mission was launched, and it will deliver a lander EDM Schiaparelli to the surface of Mars in October of the same year. Schiaparelli includes, as the only payload operating at the surface, the meteorological station DREAMS, which hosts six sensors for the measurement of the wind, temperature, pressure, RH, solar irradiance, and electric field. The station is expected to land in the Terra Meridiani region during the dust storm season. DREAMS will have the unique chance to study dusty events on Mars and their relationship with the atmospheric electric field."
6,dust aerosol climate clouds,"Ice-nucleating particle emissions from photochemically aged diesel and biodiesel exhaust. Immersion-mode ice-nucleating particle INP concentrations from an off-road diesel engine were measured using a continuous-flow diffusion chamber at -30 degrees C. Both petrodiesel and biodiesel were utilized, and the exhaust was aged up to 1.5 photochemically equivalent days using an oxidative flow reactor. We found that aged and unaged diesel exhaust of both fuels is not likely to contribute to atmospheric INP concentrations at mixed-phase cloud conditions. To explore this further, a new limit-of-detection parameterization for ice nucleation on diesel exhaust was developed. Using a global-chemical transport model, potential black carbon INP INPBC concentrations were determined using a current literature INPBC parameterization and the limit-of-detection parameterization. Model outputs indicate that the current literature parameterization likely overemphasizes INPBC concentrations, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. These results highlight the need to integrate new INPBC parameterizations into global climate models as generalized INPBC parameterizations are not valid for diesel exhaust. Ice-nucleating particles INPs are a rare subset of the atmospheric aerosol that affects the Earth's climate by modifying cloud cover, persistence, and brightness. Except in ice multiplication scenarios, ice-particle formation in the atmosphere at temperatures warmer than approximately −38°C can only be initiated by INPs. Despite their importance, the mechanisms surrounding atmospheric ice nucleation are complex and not well understood; hence, there exist large uncertainties surrounding estimates of climate forcing from ice-containing clouds. Several studies have implicated black carbon BC particles as possible INPs, as they represent a relatively abundant surface area for heterogeneous nucleation at altitudes relevant to mixed-phase clouds. The role of BC as an INP, however, remains unclear. For example, field studies have shown that BC is enhanced in ice residuals sampled from mixed-phase clouds at Jungfraujoch, implicating the possible involvement of BC in ice nucleation; other studies at the same site, however, show opposite trends. Laboratory studies of ice nucleation on BC proxies exhibit similar conflicting results, with their effectiveness as INP ranging from below the limit of instrument detection to potentially rivaling the well-known INP mineral dust. Despite this conflict, current global models that incorporate theoretical formulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation often identify BC as the second-most abundant INP type after mineral dust, with contributions ranging from 23% up to nearly 50% of all INP active. Certain types of biomass burning have been shown to be a source of BC INP INP BC and have also been shown to impact ice formation in orographic clouds; however, less is known about the contribution of INP BC from fossil fuel sources. Additionally, atmospheric aging of BC after emission can alter its physicochemical properties; therefore, it is reasonable to assume that aging may also alter its ice nucleation activity. Consequently, understanding BC as an INP, especially concerning specific sources and atmospheric aging, is essential to lowering the aforementioned uncertainty.Here this uncertainty is directly addressed by measuring INP in the emissions of a real-world BC source, an off-road diesel engine. Emissions from diesel engines comprise approximately 20% of the global BC aerosol burden by mass, and the majority of BC emissions related to fossil fuel energy. Furthermore, diesel exhaust is a BC-rich source that has been identified as an effective target for mitigation of near-term climate forcing. Depending on the ice nucleation efficacy of diesel exhaust, however, mitigating BC emissions from diesel exhaust may also alter cloud coverage through the so-called glaciation indirect aerosol effect. In this study, emissions from combustion of both conventional and biodiesel fuels were explored, and the exhaust was photochemically aged for up to 1.5 equivalent days using an oxidative flow reactor. We show that neither fresh nor aged emissions from diesel engines contributed appreciably to atmospheric INP concentrations. To explore this, we developed a new limit-of-detection parameterization for diesel exhaust BC, and we estimated potential INP concentrations using a global-chemical transport model.INP concentrations from diesel exhaust were measured using the Colorado State University continuous-flow diffusion chamber CSU-CFDC . Measurements were conducted during June 2015 in the Diesel Exhaust and Fuel + Controls DEFCon study at the CSU Powerhouse Facility's Engines Laboratory. A schematic of the experimental setup can be found in Figure S1 in the supporting information. In brief, the exhaust of a 4.5 L John Deere off-road diesel engine was sampled into a dilution chamber, which diluted the exhaust by a factor of 45–110; the engine meets the Tier 3 emissions standards set in 2007. Engine exhaust for both fuels was sampled under both idle conditions and 50% load approximately 50% rated torque and 100% rated speed . For the ice nucleation experiments, neither a diesel particulate filter nor a diesel oxidation catalyst was employed downstream of the engine. The dilution chamber operates by aspirating room air that was filtered through a HEPA filter and a 208 L activated charcoal drum to scrub particles and volatile gases, respectively. The diluted exhaust was then passed through a potential aerosol mass PAM chamber. The PAM chamber simulates photochemical aging by using an array of mercury lamps to photolyze H 2 O to OH radicals; equivalent timescales of photochemical aging are determined from the OH radical concentration. Behind the PAM chamber, the flow was split to several particle measurement instruments, including the CSU-CFDC.The CSU-CFDC samples an aerosol lamina between two vertically oriented concentric copper columns. The walls of the copper columns are chemically treated to be wettable by liquid water, which facilitates the formation of a thin, uniform layer of ice. The ice-coated walls are temperature controlled, which allows for specific control of the temperature and relative humidity RH in the aerosol lamina. For this study, the temperature and RH were set to approximately −30°C and 105% RH with respect to water, respectively. Over the course of all 151 experimental periods, the measured temperature and RH were −30.02 ± 0.12°C and 105.6 ± 0.4%, respectively; these experimental variabilities are lower than the typical instrumental uncertainties of ±0.5 K and 2.4% at −30°C. Under these water-supersaturated conditions, particles activate into droplets in the condensation/nucleation section, and those droplets which contain INP active at −30°C or warmer freeze. The lamina then enters an evaporation section held at ice saturation where droplets evaporate, but ice particles survive. Ice concentrations are determined from an optical particle counter OPC using a calibrated size threshold i.e., 3.0 µm . The OPC also counts particles greater than 500 nm using a separate calibrated size threshold. A 2.4 µm impactor at the CFDC inlet was used to remove large particles to avoid miscounting them as ice crystals. The measured INP was corrected for background counts, and significance levels were determined as described in Text S1 . All INP concentrations are reported at standard temperature and pressure.Simultaneous measurements using a scanning mobility particle sizer SMPS and single-particle soot photometer SP2 were also taken. For the SMPS, sizing scans were integrated to get the total number of particles between 32 and 829 nm. The SP2 used in this study has been described elsewhere. In brief, optical detectors measure the interaction of individual aerosol particles with a high-intensity 1064 neodymium: yttrium/aluminum/garnet Nd:YAG laser. Those particles that absorb light at 1064 nm are heated to their vaporization temperature and emit thermal radiation, a process termed laser-induced incandescence. In the atmosphere these particles are primarily refractory BC rBC , which can be verified using a dual color-band temperature measurement. It is important to note that for this study, the SP2 had a lower limit of detection of 90 nm volume equivalent diameter, assuming a BC density of 2.0 g/cm 3 . Thus, BC number concentrations are reported only for particles containing BC cores between 90 and 500 nm.Figure  1 shows a time series taken from a typical experiment with the engine at 50% load. Total particle number concentrations and rBC number are shown in the bottom panel on the left and right axes, respectively. INP concentrations at 1 Hz are shown in the middle panel, and ~5 min time-averaged INP concentrations are shown in the top panel. Filter-background periods for the CFDC are highlighted in grey. Typical background concentrations in this subset of experiments were ~2 L −1 average of 1.1 L −1 for all 151 sampling periods . At 3:25 P.M., the CFDC inlet was switched from filter to sample. At this time, the aerosol concentration after the PAM chamber was ~20,000 cm −3 , and the number concentration of rBC-containing particles between 90 and 500 nm was greater than 1000 cm −3 . Despite high total particle and rBC number concentrations, the INP concentrations remained at ~2 L −1 , not significantly different than background level. Thus, the INP active fraction was less than ~1 in 10 7 of the total aerosol. After the second filter period, the voltage on the PAM chamber was set to 4 V; under normal circumstances, this corresponds to ~18 days photochemical aging, but significant OH radical suppression from organic species in the exhaust occurred in this study. Thus, for this study, this setting corresponds to an OH exposure equivalent to 1.5 days of photochemical aging by OH at 1.5 × 10 6  molecules/cm 3 . As shown, aging the exhaust to 1.5 photochemically equivalent days did not enhance the INP concentrations in diesel exhaust, which continued to be similar to the background. After the third filter period, the CFDC inlet was disconnected from the back of the PAM chamber and allowed to sample ambient room air in the CSU Powerhouse Facility's Engines Laboratory. Concentrations from the SMPS and SP2 are not shown because they were still sampling from the PAM chamber exit, but aerosol concentrations were much lower in the room air than in the exhaust. Despite this, the concentration of INP in the ambient air was approximately 10 L −1 , which is well above the background and agrees well with the DeMott et al . “global” INP parameterization.CSU-CFDC, SMPS, and SP2 data collected on 3 June 2015 for petrodiesel exhaust from an off-road diesel engine at 50% load that has been filtered, run through the PAM chamber with the lamps off 0 days aging , and aged 1.5 equivalent photochemical days in the PAM chamber. Also shown are CSU-CFDC data from ambient air in the CSU Powerhouse Facility's Engines Laboratory. The SMPS and SP2 data from the ambient air period are not available as these instruments were sampling diesel exhaust behind the PAM chamber.Similar experiments on diesel and biodiesel exhaust were conducted for a total of 151 sampling periods. To facilitate a quantitative analysis between this work and previous studies, we use a modified version of the ice nucleation efficiency parameter ξ T , as defined by Petters et al .: where AF 105 is the fraction of all particles active as INP at ~105% RH. This parameter is slightly modified from the work of Petters et al ., who used the maximum activated fraction by conducting supersaturation scans for each of their sampling periods and then used the activated fraction at the RH just prior to droplet breakthrough. As shown in the supporting information, our maximum activated fractions were not significantly different than those at 105% RH. The results for diesel emissions from all sampling periods are shown in Figure  2 . For comparison, we show in Figure  2 ξ −30 determined for the emissions from the combustion of biomass fuels during the fourth Fire Laboratory at Missoula Experiment FLAME4 . Figure  2 also includes data from this study for two proxies of mineral dust and ice nucleation active bacteria, NX-Illite and SnoMax, respectively. Each of these samples was size selected to 500 nm using a differential mobility analyzer.Ice nucleation efficiency of diesel red sticks and biodiesel blue sticks exhaust under idle and 50% load conditions. Also shown are time-averaged data for laboratory burns of biomass fuels from FLAME4 dark grey markers and from 500 nm size-selected SnoMax and NX-illite particles this study; black markers . The range of significance for all diesel-exhaust sampling periods is highlighted in grey.From Figure  2 , the range of calculated significance limits highlighted in grey for ξ −30 for all diesel experiments was between −6.5 and −8.6. This range of significance for ξ -30 depends on both the absolute significance levels Text S1 and the total particle concentration. For the 151 time-averaged sampling periods, the total particle concentration varied from ~3000 cm 3 to 180,000 cm 3 . Of these, the majority n  = 148 were under 90,000 cm −3 . Above 90,000 cm −3 and at T  = −30°C, the vapor flux from the warm to the cold wall may not be sufficient to maintain the intended supersaturation leading to reductions >3%. Such conditions have been shown to result in systematic undercounting of INP activated fractions by 1 order of magnitude. Since our counts were below the significance level in all cases, it is impossible to correct for this potential undercounting. We note, however, that INPs were not shown to significantly increase during the supersaturation scans done in this study Text S2 . This suggests that undercounting due to reductions in the RH below 105% was likely minimal. All of the individual sampling periods for aged and unaged diesel and biodiesel under both idle conditions and 50% load in Figure  2 are below their individual significance level. Thus, no more than ~1 in 5 × 10 6 to 5 × 10 8 diesel exhaust particles will act as INP. This fraction is well below the fraction of INP in ambient aerosol in the free troposphere, as measured in previous studies. Consequently, it is not likely that aged or unaged diesel and biodiesel exhaust will contribute significantly to atmospheric INP concentrations. In contrast, Figure  2 indicates that emissions from laboratory burns of some biomass fuels can produce ξ −30 above our range of significance. Thus, biomass burning may be a more important source of INP depending on the fuel type. Finally, all of the combustion particles are much less efficient than the laboratory proxies for mineral dust and ice-active proteins.Although we did not investigate the temperature dependence of ξ T , it is likely that INP concentrations decrease with increasing temperature, similar to previous field observations. Thus, our measured ξ −30 are expected to be near the upper limit of the fraction of diesel-exhaust INP active as condensation/immersion-freezing nuclei under mixed-phase cloud conditions.Since ξ −30 from diesel and biodiesel exhaust are lower than our experimental significance levels, we can use our results to bound the maximum contributions to potential INP concentrations from these sources. To explore this further, we developed a new limit-of-detection LOD parameterization for BC particles associated with diesel and biodiesel exhaust. Data from this experiment were evaluated under the singular hypothesis, which stipulates that the time dependence of freezing events is of secondary importance to the temperature dependence. In this vein, the data were parameterized using the ice nucleation active site density n s model: To quantify the effect of this LOD parameterization on modeled INP BC concentrations, global maps of BC concentrations by source i.e., fossil fuel and biomass burning were first produced. To calculate BC concentrations, we used the Goddard Earth Observing System chemical-transport model GEOS-Chem version 10.01. Our simulations were driven by GEOS-5 assimilated meteorology fields http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov and included aerosol tracers for sulfate, sea salt, nitrate, ammonium, dust, organic carbon, and black carbon as well as 52 gas-phase species. We simulated the year 2010 with one month of model spin-up not included in analysis at 4° × 5° horizontal resolution and 47 vertical layers. Black and organic carbon emissions from fossil fuel and biofuel combustion are from Bond et al . and biomass burning from the Global Fire Emissions Database version 3 GFED3 . In order to determine atmospheric BC concentrations by source, we ran two simulations: one simulation included all BC emission sources and one simulation included only biofuel and biomass-burning BC emissions fossil fuel emissions off . Comparing these two simulations allowed us to isolate the BC from fossil fuel sources. To determine particle surface area, we applied the BET surface area, 108 m 2 /g to the BC mass distributions. In order to get particle number, we scale modeled BC mass into size distributions assuming a lognormal distribution with number median diameter of 180 nm and a standard deviation of 1.8 similar to Karydis et al . . Both fossil fuel and biomass-burning BC number concentration global maps at the surface and the annually and zonally averaged latitude versus pressure plots of BC number concentrations can be found in Figure S4 .To determine the global distribution of INP BC that would be predicted using existing parameterizations that are not specific to the source of BC, we applied the M12 soot INP parameterization to modeled fossil fuel and biomass-burning concentrations. Figure  3 a shows the number concentrations of BC active as INP at −20°C −20 in Figure  3 b to that in Figure  3 a. As indicated by a ratio near 1, there was essentially no reduction in −20 at the surface using M12 parameterization for both fossil fuel and biomass-burning sources, Figure  3 b amb as the concentration of INP active at ambient temperatures derived from the model output. In other words, the parameterizations are evaluated based on local values of both BC concentrations and temperature. The annual zonal mean latitude versus pressure plots of −20 in the global distribution maps, there are large interhemispheric differences in amb ratios, the model shows that the M12 parameterization may overemphasize; however, those studies had a ξ T lower limit of −3 and, therefore, could not fully characterize the limited atmospheric relevance of diesel exhaust INPs. Further, those studies did not investigate the effects of different fuel types and only probed aging timescales up to a few hours. Consistent with molecular dynamics studies, oxidative aging of the exhaust particles did not increase their ice nucleation efficiency in the immersion mode; however, some key atmospheric copollutants may have been missing in the PAM chamber. Our results also differ from the conclusions from laboratory studies on simple flame burner production of soot from acetylene and kerosene, emphasizing the importance of measurements on real-world BC sources.To explore the significance of these results, a LOD parameterization for BC, specific to diesel engine sources, was developed under the singular hypothesis. The predictions of ice nucleation active site densities from this parameterization are over 4 orders of magnitude lower than current parameterizations in the literature that were based primarily on laboratory studies of burner-soot particles. Both parameterizations were applied to global distributions of BC particle number concentrations that were modeled using GEOS-Chem, separating BC emissions into fossil fuel and biomass-burning sources. In contrast to our LOD n s parameterization, using the current literature n s parameterization for BC INPs from fossil fuel sources overemphasized INPs in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in the Arctic, a region of particular sensitivity to climate change due, in part, to the impact that cloud cover has on surface radiative fluxes. Furthermore, the persistence of these mixed-phase clouds is expected to be sensitive to INP concentrations, as modest increases in ice concentrations can lead to the rapid conversion of mixed-phase clouds to all-ice clouds. Additionally, our findings could help explain INP biases in those global climate models that use theoretical representations of ice nucleation, which tend to overestimate ice nucleation from BC sources. Correcting these biases may be critical for correctly modeling future climate.Finally, although we used the current literature parameterization for biomass-burning aerosol, BC from these sources may also be less efficient than INPs emitted from burner soot. Previous laboratory burns of various biomass fuels indicate that INP emissions from biomass burning are highly variable, both between burn types and burning conditions; more recent laboratory burns confirm this behavior and can specifically attribute some ice nucleation behavior to rBC-containing particles. Furthermore, McCluskey et al . have shown that certain biomass-burning events will emit and may even be dominated by a BC-type INP. Future studies should focus on further unraveling the physicochemical traits of BC-specific INP emissions from real-world biomass-burning events."
7,dust climate aerosol ocean,"Paleodust variability since the Last Glacial Maximum and implications for iron inputs to the ocean. Changing climate conditions affect dust emissions and the global dust cycle, which in turn affects climate and biogeochemistry. In this study we use observationally constrained model reconstructions of the global dust cycle since the Last Glacial Maximum, combined with different simplified assumptions of atmospheric and sea ice processing of dust-borne iron, to provide estimates of soluble iron deposition to the oceans. For different climate conditions, we discuss uncertainties in model-based estimates of atmospheric processing and dust deposition to key oceanic regions, highlighting the large degree of uncertainty of this important variable for ocean biogeochemistry and the global carbon cycle. We also show the role of sea ice acting as a time buffer and processing agent, which results in a delayed and pulse-like soluble iron release into the ocean during the melting season, with monthly peaks up to similar to 17 Gg/month released into the Southern Oceans during the Last Glacial Maximum LGM . Mineral dust is an important component of the climate system of the Earth. Dust emissions occur in response to surface erosion initiated by wind stress on the land surface in arid or semiarid areas with low vegetation cover. Fine-grained <10 µm diameter dust aerosols undergo long-range transport, with average lifetimes of a few days. Airborne dust particles impact cloud microphysics and scatter and absorb solar and terrestrial radiation, altering the energy budget of the atmosphere. Together with emission and transport, size-dependent dry and wet deposition scavenging processes shape the spatial features of the global dust cycle's mass balance, as well as the size distribution of dust particles. Dust acts as a carrier for elements phosphorous and iron that can limit the productivity in land and marine ecosystems, modifying carbon sequestration.The stratigraphic preservation of dust deposition in natural archives—such as ice cores, loess/paleosol sequences, or marine sediments—allows, under opportune circumstances, quantitative reconstructions of past Dust Mass Accumulation Rates DMARs , which can be consistently used to constrain the global dust cycle.We analyze the variability of the global dust cycle simulated with the Community Earth System Model CESM constrained by size-resolved observations of DMAR at different time slices between the Last Glacial Maximum LGM ~21,000 years before present 21 ka B.P. up to the preindustrial PI climate, examining uncertainties in data model comparisons of dust deposition in key regions. We then estimate soluble iron solFe deposition using different sets of assumptions and calculate deposition budgets for different ocean regions. Finally, we discuss the role of seasonal sea ice in acting as a temporal buffer and leaching agent for solFe release into the oceans. The iron released from melting sea ice can impact phytoplankton community composition and bloom dynamics, productivity, and carbon export.The CESM is a fully coupled global Earth System Model that contributes to the Coupled Modelling Intercomparison Project CMIP /Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project PMIP . The dust model coupled to the CESM is based on a representation of the major components of dust cycle: mobilization, transport, and deposition. Modeled impacts on climate include direct radiative forcing, and radiative impacts of dust on both snow and sea ice. We use CESM version 1.0.5 with the state of the art version of the dust Bulk Aerosol Model sectional model representing dust in four size bins spanning 0.1–10 µm diameter coupled to the Community Atmosphere Model 4 to simulate the global climate and the dust cycle during different periods, in climate equilibrium conditions.Time resolution over the study period is achieved by performing new simulations complementary to detailed previous work. A total of eight simulations are included: PI 1850 A.D. , 2 ka B.P., 4 ka B.P., MH 6 ka B.P. , 8 ka B.P., 10 ka B.P., H1 16 ka B.P. , and LGM 21 ka B.P. —see Table S1 in the supporting information for details.We used the PMIP3 equilibrium simulations as initial conditions, following the PMIP3 protocol for greenhouse gas concentrations, land and ice sheets, and the use of PI vegetation. Dust emissions account for changes in vegetation area by scaling the erodible surface of each grid cell based on the fractional vegetation cover simulated with the BIOME4 model. The magnitude and spatial features of dust emissions were constrained by particle size-resolved DMAR data for each climate scenario and provenance fingerprinting with dust radiogenic isotopes. A new simulation for PI climate assumes that soil erodibilty is the same as for the late Holocene ~2 ka B.P., except we did not include glaciogenic sources in Alaska or dune mobilization in Nebraska. The simulation for a Heinrich stadial was associated with H1 ~16 ka B.P. and rerun with a reduced soil erodibility scale factor for South America one fourth of LGM, based on EPICA Dome C data to account for the shrinking of glaciogenic sources compared to the LGM. Current limitations of our approach include the use of time slices rather than a transient simulation, the lack of a dynamical vegetation model, and several assumptions concerning the homogeneous dust elemental composition and the processing of dust-borne iron, including paleofires.The bioavailable fraction of iron is not well known, partly because of differences in analytical procedures. Observational evidence indicates a atmospheric processing of iron to soluble iron, b varying solubility under different dust and aerosol chemical conditions, and c direct emission of soluble iron from combustion sources. We assume 3.5% mass iron content in dust and that the labile iron is soluble. We estimate solFe deposition to the ocean with five different sets of assumptions for details, see supporting information Figure S5 , in order to constrain the uncertainties in atmospheric processing based on published hypotheses. The five scenarios include one case assuming constant iron solubility of 2% CON , as well as four different scenarios which also consider emissions of iron from PI biomass burning. CON2 is simply the combination of CON and PI biomass burning iron. MOD based on Luo et al . and Mahowald et al . , SIZ, and INV based on Sholkovitz et al . consider processing of dust-borne iron and biomass burning emissions Figure S5 . In addition, we estimate a the uncertainties related to dust deposition and b the potential role of dust processing by sea ice, which observations suggest increases iron solubility by a factor of ~2.5.CESM reconstructions estimate higher global emissions during the late glacial stages than during the Holocene, with a minimum in the early/mid-Holocene Figures  1 a– 1 d and supporting information Figure S1 , in line with observations of DMAR. The LGM was characterized by high dust deposition rates in both hemispheres Figure  1 c . H1 coincides with larger emissions from the Northern Hemisphere NH , resulting in enhanced dust deposition globally at 16 ka B.P. 6771 Tg/a compared to 21 ka B.P. 6294 Tg/a , despite the drastic reduction of glaciogenic dust emissions from South America and in the Southern Hemisphere SH Figure  1 d . By the early Holocene, global dust emissions had reduced significantly to ~2900 Tg/a at 10 ka B.P., shrinking to a minimum 2427 Tg/a ~8 ka B.P. and later expanding again until PI ~2798 Tg/a . Concurrently, the emissions from the SH decreased during the Holocene, while the NH emissions were increasing, consistent with the insolation-induced changes in seasonality and the monsoon systems. At the same time emissions were also shifting gradually from Asia toward North Africa in terms of mass balance Figures  1 a– 1 c . a–c Time series of dust deposition 0.1–10 µm in the CESM simulations for PI, MH, and LGM climates. d Mass budgets of dust deposition global, NH, and SH . e–l Model red diamonds deposition compared to DMAR observations solid line: fine <10 µm ; dotted: bulk .For reference, global dust emission and deposition in previous studies ranged from ~1000 to ~5000 Tg/a for interglacial climates and from ~2000 to ~14,000 Tg/a for the LGM. For the present day, the AeroCom median of 15 global models is 1257 Tg/a. Here we estimate that 440 and 826 Tg/a dust are deposited to the world's oceans in PI and LGM, respectively Table S1 . For current climate conditions, a composite estimate of dust deposition to the ocean from different models amounts to 450 Tg/a.Our simulations capture the trends in observed dust deposition in Greenland Figure  1 e and Antarctica Figure  1 f , but not all the details, because the model was constrained with a larger data set. The simulated LGM/Holocene dust deposition ratio is ~4 for GISP2, compared to ~17 from the observations average 19–23 ka BP for the LGM, which may be substantially influenced by changes in atmospheric circulation that are not captured by the model. At Dome C, the simulated LGM/Holocene ratio is larger ~10 but still less than the observations ~25 . The absolute values of deposition fluxes are overestimated for the Holocene LGM by a factor of ~10 3 in Greenland and ~4 20 in Antarctica. Part of this overestimation is probably related to the model's relatively too smooth gradient in dust deposition between sources and remote regions.The CESM-based dust deposition at sites downwind from North Africa captures features of the observed DMAR note the distinction between fine fraction and bulk in Figure  1 , including the increase in dust deposition during H1 compared to the LGM, and the early/mid-Holocene dust minimum Figures  1 g and 1 h . DMAR fine is better reproduced in the equatorial Atlantic Figure  1 h than in the North African margin, where it is overestimated by the model Figure  1 g , possibly because of inaccurate representation of the temporal dynamics of dust source activation or wind patterns, or an overestimation of wet deposition of dust in the CESM. Alternatively, the observed DMAR at GC68 may be underestimated, as it is comparable in magnitude to remote sites in the equatorial Pacific in the early to mid-Holocene. For GC68 the partitioning of riverine versus eolian contributions is based on end-member decomposition of the grain size distribution. This approach has its greatest uncertainties in the fine fraction. On the other hand, DMAR estimates from equatorial Atlantic core RC24-01 also have large uncertainties due to its relatively coarse age model and lower sediment accumulation rates with larger impacts of bioturbation. Down-core measurements of particle size distributions were not performed for RC24-01 but were approximated by a constant fraction 0.5 of particles < 10 µm, based on nearby sediment trap measurements. Therefore, part of the model-observation mismatch may be related to uncertainties in estimating the fine fraction of the total eolian flux Figures  1 g and 1 h, dotted line versus solid line , suggesting possible inconsistency among observations themselves.In the equatorial Pacific our reconstructions agree with the magnitude and trends of dust deposition at 110°W but underestimate DMAR farther west at 140°W Figures  1 i and 1 j in both glacial and interglacial conditions. In our simulations, this seems at least in part related to the penetration of the North African dust plume across the Atlantic and into the Pacific, which may not be fully consistent with the latest observational evidence on dust provenance in the region see also supporting information Figure S2 . Another feature emerging from the observations is the N-S gradient in dust deposition, which remains relatively constant across the LGM-Holocene transition. This feature is partially reproduced by our simulations, but a minimum in simulated dust deposition at the equator is not found in the observations Figure S2 and associated discussion in the supporting information . Biases in model precipitation evident for current climate could explain the mismatch supporting information Figure S2 ; in our simulations the dust deposition flux, there is controlled primarily by the dust load i.e., availability of dust and modulated by the precipitation, as wet deposition is the dominant process for dust removal from the atmosphere supporting information Figure S3 . The “double ITCZ” is a known bias in the state of the art climate models, and it may also account for very low dust deposition in the Western Pacific in the CESM.Our simulations reproduce the magnitude and trends of dust deposition at sites sampling the main Australian dust corridors during the Holocene but fail to capture late glacial trends. Too high dust deposition is simulated for the NW site Figure  1 k , whose trends are confirmed by a dust proxy from a nearby core, whereas the LGM spike in dust deposition in the Tasman Sea record is not matched Figure  1 l . Simulated LGM dust emissions are intense both from the Lake Eyre Basin and the West, whereas only the former is a significant dust source in the PI supporting information Figure S4 . Paleoclimate and geomorphological evidence is consistent with spatial variability in landscape response to LGM/deglacial climate oscillations, possibly related to the interplay between the monsoon and the Southern westerlies. On the other hand, the CESM shows no significant variability in the ITCZ on glacial-interglacial time scales. Our simulations underestimate dust deposition at site PS75/59-2 125°W, 54°S by an order of magnitude, although they capture the observational LGM/Holocene ratio ~3 supporting information Figure S1 .Interestingly, observed Holocene DMAR at PS75/59-2 are lower than the upwind Tasman Sea record, but of the same magnitude as the NW site fine fraction , which is very close to the continent. Similarly, Albani et al . pointed out that Holocene DMARs in the South Atlantic are comparable to those form the North Atlantic fine fraction , in a region where satellites show little dust today, suggesting possible incongruences as discussed earlier for the North Atlantic. More data of both DMAR and particle size distribution are needed to constrain the models and tackle this problem.A common assumption that dust-borne iron has a constant solubility of 2% CON Figure  2 a hides the spatial variability that both dust composition and atmospheric processing impart on bioavailable iron. A sensitivity study including biomass burning sources of iron CON2 is contrasted with other MOD, SIZ, and INV simplified approximations of atmospheric dust processing and sensitivity to aerosol abundance supporting information Figure S5 and suggests a different regional distribution of deposition. a, c, and e Simulated solFe deposition flux ng/m 2 /s to the oceans, including on sea ice, during the PI using different sets of assumptions. Printed numbers indicate the global deposition to the ocean and sea ice. White lines indicate the limits of ocean regions. b, d, and f Normalized time series to PI of simulated solFe deposition to different ocean regions, for the corresponding cases.There are also significant differences in the global estimates of solFe deposition to the ocean, ranging from 0.08 to 0.39 Tg/a for PI Figures  2 a, 2 c, and 2 e and supporting information Figure S5 and 0.20 to 0.82 for the LGM, with MOD and SIZ giving the smaller and larger estimates, respectively. All cases show larger temporal variability absolute and relative in the Southern Ocean and North Pacific regions Figures  2 b, 2 d, 2 f, and 2 h; supporting information Figure S5 ; and supporting information Tables S2–S6 , in line with observed changes in dust deposition of a factor of ~5.For CON, we estimate how uncertainties in dust deposition without specifically analyzing the large range of estimates using different observational approaches, which is beyond the scope of this paper propagate into solFe deposition budgets for key oceanic regions, based on the model-observation comparison Figure  3 . Note that in general, we expect model and observations comparisons of dust deposition to be scattered within 1 order of magnitude. CESM simulations tuned with global data sets are on the high end for deposition downwind of the North African plume in the Atlantic, but on the low end in the equatorial Pacific, possibly suggesting an overall too sharp reduction of the North African plume as it moves westward, or a different source mix in the model, with possible underestimation of South and central American sources Figures  3 a and 3 b and supporting information Figure S2 . For the southern oceans >30°S significant uncertainties arise depending on the specific choice of observational constraints Figure  3 c , highlighting the importance of gathering more observations of deposition magnitude. Note that uncertainties related to the gradient in mid-to-high latitudes dust depositions discussed in section 3.1 may contribute to the overall uncertainty in estimates of dust/iron deposition to the Southern Ocean.Time series of SolFe CON regional deposition rates Tg/a into oceanic regions, as in Figure  2 : a North/Central + equatorial Atlantic, b equatorial Pacific, and c Southern Ocean.

Grey shading: uncertainty envelope.The sea ice component of CESM allows partitioning of dust deposition onto open waters compared to sea ice. In the high-latitude oceans the fraction of dust and associated iron that is deposited on sea ice increases closer to the poles Figures  4 a and 4 b . At latitudes > 45°S in the Southern Ocean dust-borne iron intercepted by sea ice blue, dotted line in Figures  4 c, 4 d, 4 g, and 4 h in our PI simulations represents about one eighth of the deposition over the open ocean, but the proportions become comparable during LGM, because of an increase in sea ice extent and a preferential strengthening of sources supplying dust to regions with high sea ice cover. A similar situation is simulated in the Arctic Figures  4 c, 4 d, 4 g, and 4 h .Simulated solFe CON fluxes ng/m 2 /s from the atmosphere to the ocean open waters and from sea ice to the ocean for a, b PI and e, f LGM climate.

Sea ice extent yellow over the same high-latitude regions is scaled independently for plotting purposes.The climatological annual cycle of iron inputs into the oceans shows a marked seasonality, determined by the interplay between direct atmospheric inputs into the ocean and the inputs mediated by the sea ice. Sea ice itself represents a weathering environment, where iron solubility was shown to potentially increase by a factor of ~2.5 ± 2.5 as a result of photoreductive processes in ice and melting/freezing cycles which allow intermittent chemical weathering to form Fe as oxyhydr oxides. Dust deposition on sea ice results in a delayed and pulse-like solFe release into the ocean as sea ice melts annually Figures  4 c, 4 d, 4 g, and 4 h . This pulse of iron comes just at the beginning of the growing season and may favor the larger phytoplankton and bloom development, which leads to more efficient export of carbon to the ocean interior.The simulated net solFe input into the high-latitude oceans during the peak months is 3 times higher in the NH than the SH Figure  4 . The spatial features of iron deposition show that certain regions such as the Atlantic Sector receive substantially more iron than the average Southern Ocean Figures  4 a and 4 b . During the LGM, the magnitude and relative importance of sea ice mediated release of solFe into the ocean becomes even larger Figures  4 g and 4 h .We estimate CON scenario that up to 6 and 90 Gg/a solFe could be released into the Southern Ocean south of 45°S 33 and 88 in the NH high-latitude oceans for PI climate conditions and the LGM, respectively Figure  4 . In the LGM/PI comparison, sea ice processing amplifies solFe input to the ocean by 10% in the NH and 22% in the SH on average. Additional processes supply iron in the real ocean, including hydrothermal vents, shelf sediments, and ice rafted debris.Overall, our study shows that substantial uncertainty exists in current estimates of solFe deposition to the ocean, when accounting for the combined uncertainties from dust deposition, atmospheric processing, and sea ice processing supporting information Figure S6 . In the most extreme scenario ~1.6 Tg/a solFe could enter the ocean waters south of 30°S during the LGM.For the first time, we provide data-constrained global model reconstructions of dust and solFe deposition at different time slices from the LGM to PI climate, complemented by a set of sensitivity studies designed to estimate the range of the composite uncertainty arising from uncertainties in dust deposition, atmospheric, and sea ice processing in regions of particular importance for ocean biogeochemistry and the carbon cycle.The model reconstructions show a reasonably good agreement with observations of dust deposition from paleodust archives, both in terms of trends and absolute values. Global dust deposition reached a maximum during H1 ~ 16 ka B.P. 6771 Tg/a and a minimum during the early/mid-Holocene ~8 ka B.P. 2427 Tg/a .Estimates of dust-borne solFe deposition to the oceans using five different sets of assumptions reveal a wide uncertainty, with global estimates between 0.08 and 0.39 Tg/a for the PI climate and between 0.20 and 0.82 Tg/a for the LGM CON scenario . The larger variations in LGM versus PI climate were simulated for the Southern Ocean and Northern Pacific, both regions where ocean biogeochemistry is sensitive to iron inputs. Our approach here uses several common methods for estimating soluble iron to examine the sensitivity of our results to assumptions and shows that combustion iron from paleofires could be important for paleoclimate simulations. The details of the assumptions about iron solubility matter greatly for spatial and temporal variabilities in solFe deposition. Because evidence suggests that both the amount and the mineralogy of dust matters for solubility, more data about the composition and/or sources of dust and other iron sources should be acquired.Sea ice acts as a time buffer resulting in a delayed, pulsed solFe release into the ocean during the melting season, with peaks up to ~17 Gg/month released into the Southern Ocean during the LGM, if also considering the potential role of sea ice in iron processing CON . The spatial features of solFe release into the ocean waters reveal comparable deposition rates in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and in low-latitude regions of moderately high dust flux, like the Caribbean, during the LGM.A much larger range of estimates of solFe input to specific oceanic regions arises when considering the composite uncertainty of dust deposition, atmospheric, and sea ice processing.Given the importance of the episodic nature of atmospheric inputs for ocean biogeochemistry, our results may prove valuable for testing the iron hypothesis, in line with observations supporting the idea that dust was a significant contributor to stimulating the glacial biological pump. Further studies with coupled models simulating marine ecosystem dynamics are needed to determine the net export production, hence the net dust-induced effect on atmospheric CO 2 concentrations."
8,aerosol,"Comparison of aerosol optical properties above clouds between POLDER and AeroCom models over the South East Atlantic Ocean during the fire season. Aerosol properties above clouds have been retrieved over the South East Atlantic Ocean during the fire season 2006 using satellite observations from POLDER Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances . From June to October, POLDER has observed a mean Above-Cloud Aerosol Optical Thickness ACAOT of 0.28 and a mean Above-Clouds Single Scattering Albedo ACSSA of 0.87 at 550 nm. These results have been used to evaluate the simulation of aerosols above clouds in five Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport GOCART , Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model 3 HadGEM3 , European Centre Hamburg Model 5-Hamburg Aerosol Module 2 ECHAM5-HAM2 , Oslo-Chemical Transport Model 2 OsloCTM2 , and Spectral Radiation-Transport Model for Aerosol Species SPRINTARS . Most models do not reproduce the observed large aerosol load episodes. The comparison highlights the importance of the injection height and the vertical transport parameterizations to simulate the large ACAOT observed by POLDER. Furthermore, POLDER ACSSA is best reproduced by models with a high imaginary part of black carbon refractive index, in accordance with recent recommendations. The large uncertainties related to aerosol radiative impacts are a major concern in climate research. When aerosols are horizontally collocated with clouds, the estimation of their radiative forcing is challenging because of the variety and the complexity of the interaction processes. Aerosols have a direct impact on the Earth radiative budget by scattering and absorbing radiations. These interactions influence the vertical profile of temperature and humidity, which affects the formation and the development of clouds semidirect effect . Aerosols have also an impact on the cloud albedo, lifetime, and precipitation by acting as cloud condensation nuclei indirect effects . Therefore, overlapping of aerosol and cloud layers is a key situation that helps understand the aerosol impacts on the Earth system.The South East Atlantic Ocean SEAO is a particularly good region for analyzing the full range of aerosol perturbations. From June to September, biomass burning aerosols are injected into the atmosphere in Southern Africa and are often transported westward to the coast. Smoke plumes are frequently observed above the semipermanent deck of stratocumulus clouds over the ocean. Composed of a complex combination of black and organic carbon, smoke aerosol plumes absorb UV and visible light. Above highly reflective clouds, their Direct Radiative Effect DRE is usually positive because aerosol absorption reduces local planetary albedo. Recent studies based on remote sensing observations have shown that the DRE of Above-Cloud Aerosols ACA is typically strong over the SEAO and can reach instantaneous values larger than +130 Wm −2 . However, global aerosol models do not reproduce such high DRE. Moreover, a large spread in DRE estimates is observed within AeroCom Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models models in this region. This highlights the need to better constrain aerosol and cloud properties, and especially those controlling the DRE of ACA: the amount of aerosols above clouds, their absorption, and the albedo of the underlying clouds. In this study, the first two parameters will be addressed.In the last few years, methods have been developed to derive aerosol properties above clouds from passive satellite measurements. On the one hand, Ozone Monitoring Instrument OMI and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS observations have been used to retrieve simultaneously the Above-Cloud Aerosol Optical Thickness ACAOT and cloud properties, such as the Aerosol-Corrected Cloud Optical Thickness ACCOT and the cloud droplet effective radius. However, those algorithms rely on a prescription of an aerosol model, notably their Above-Cloud Single Scattering Albedo ACSSA , because total radiances are mostly sensitive to the absorption of the overlaying aerosols. On the other hand, polarized radiances provide and additional constraint because they carry the scattering of the aerosol layer above liquid clouds. POLDER Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances aboard the PARASOL Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar satellite has the unique capability of measuring not only total radiances but also polarized radiances for several wavelengths and viewing angles. In order to fully exploit the potential of this instrument, the method developed by to retrieve the ACAOT from polarized measurement has been recently improved with total radiances and now also retrieves the ACSSA and the ACCOT. Those new remote sensing retrievals offer new possibilities to assess more aspects of the numerical simulations of aerosols. have carried out a comparison of the aerosol DRE obtained with Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography with the HadGEM2 model. However, comparing aerosol properties i.e., ACAOT and ACSSA is necessary to understand the processes responsible for diversity in modeled DREs.This study aims at illustrating the potential of the new POLDER products to constrain the aerosol properties simulated by five global models that participated in AeroCom phase II. The POLDER algorithm has been applied to the SEAO region during the fire season. Descriptions of the POLDER retrieval, the analyzed models, and the comparison methodology are given in section 2 . Results are presented in section 3 , and explanations of the observed differences between models and POLDER are discussed in section 4 . Finally, section 5 summarizes the main findings.The multidirectional polarized and total radiances measured by POLDER are used in a complementary way. The first step of the aerosol retrieval consists in the estimation of the scattering AOT and aerosol size distribution. The polarized signal of liquid clouds is characterized by a large peak at a scattering angle Θ ≈ 140°, which is called the cloud bow, and a small amount of polarization at side scattering angles i.e., Θ < 130° . Because the polarized signature only comes from the upper cloud layer, it no longer depends on the COT when the COT is larger than 3. When aerosols are located above clouds, the extinction leads to a reduction of the cloud bow, while scattering processes from the fine mode generates an additional polarization at side scattering angles. Consequently, the scattering AOT and the fine-mode aerosol effective radius are retrieved based on the signal acquired for Θ < 130° at 670 and 865 nm. The second step of the algorithm is dedicated to the simultaneous retrieval of the Above-Cloud Absorption AOT ACAAOT and the COT with total radiances. While the signal produced at the top of the clouds is almost spectrally neutral from UV to shortwave infrared wavelengths, the spectral signature of the aerosol absorption leads to a stronger impact on radiances at shorter wavelengths. This is called the color-ratio effect. Once scattering AOT and aerosol size are known, radiances at 490 nm and 865 nm can be interpreted as a pair of COT and ACAAOT. Both parts of the retrieval are based on a look-up table approach. The retrieval is attempted for each 6 × 6 km 2 POLDER pixel with COT ≥ 3. To enhance the quality of the product, several filters are applied. Notably, inhomogeneous clouds are rejected, which represents less than 17% of the observations over the SEAO in August and September 2006. More details about the algorithm and the applied filters are provided in the papers of and. The POLDER Level 1 products used in this analysis correspond to the PARASOL Collection 2 v03.02.The accuracy of the retrieved aerosol properties mainly depends on the assumption made about the real part of the refractive index 1.47 and the approximation that polarized radiances only account for the scattering AOT. The impacts of both assumptions on the retrieval have been assessed in Figure 5 of. In this analysis, the uncertainty on the ACAOT and the ACSSA has been evaluated for each inversion by reporting these errors. Additionally, the cloud top height CTH has been estimated with POLDER based on the apparent O 2 pressure method since the presence of an aerosol layer above clouds has little impact on the retrieval.The AeroCom project brings together international global aerosol models in order to better understand and reduce model diversity by using common experimental data protocols and emission inventories. Five models have supplied the daily profiles needed for this analysis: Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport GOCART , Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model 3 HadGEM3 , European Centre Hamburg Model 5-Hamburg Aerosol Module 2 ECHAM5-HAM2 , Oslo-Chemical Transport Model 2 OsloCTM2 , and Spectral Radiation-Transport Model for Aerosol Species SPRINTARS . The runs correspond to the AeroCom control simulations A2-CTRL-06 . Model descriptions are given in Table  1 , and additional information can be found in.BC: 6.1OC: 5.0Thomas DiehlMian ChinBC: 4.1OC: 4.0Nicolas BellouinJames MollardBC: 5.9POA: 6.4Ulrike LohmannPhilip StierKai ZhangBC: 6.3OM: 5.1Gunnar MyhreRagnhild B. SkeieTerje BerntsenIn order to select aerosols above clouds only, we have used daily vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction, the aerosol absorption, and the cloud fraction CF . In absence of more detailed information about clouds e.g., the liquid water content , CF profiles have been used to identify the location of the modeled cloud layer. The CTH is defined as the altitude where the CF becomes larger than 15% assuming maximum overlap. Since the POLDER algorithm rejects the events contaminated by cirrus, the presence of clouds is not taken into account in models for altitude larger than 4 km, where clouds are most likely in ice or mixed phase. The aerosol extinction and absorption are then integrated from the top of the atmosphere to the cloud top height in order to compute ACAOT and ACAAOT. Finally, each 6 × 6 km 2 POLDER observation is compared with the co-located modeled aerosol properties. For each model, comparison to POLDER is done only where both POLDER and the model have clouds.The impact of the CF threshold has been examined by considering thresholds of 15% ± 3%. Because the modeled vertical profile of CF shows a well-defined layer at low altitude, the threshold has a small impact, with a maximum mean change of ±3% only for the ACAOT and less than ±1% for the ACSSA.The comparison between POLDER and AeroCom models is performed in terms of CTH, ACAOT, and ACSSA at 550 nm over the SEAO region 5°N–30°S, 20°E–20°W for the fire season 2006. Figure  1 shows the ACAOT and ACSSA time series from June to October. Variation of the POLDER ACAOT is consistent with the DRE seasonality observed by. On average over the 5 months, POLDER retrieves an ACAOT equal to 0.28 with an uncertainty interval ranging from 0.26 to 0.36. The ACAOT derived from models shows a large spread. OsloCTM2 is the model that best reproduces the satellite estimations of the ACAOT regarding both the temporal evolution e.g., the peaks in July, August, and September and the average over the period i.e., 0.26 . The ACAOT derived from GOCART is half that of POLDER with a mean value of 0.15. The amount of aerosols above clouds in HadGEM3, ECHAM5-HAM2, and SPRINTARS hardly exceeds 0.1 with averages of 0.08, 0.09, and 0.09, respectively. The analysis of the mean SSA profiles for August–September have revealed a distinct above-cloud layer in all models. This indicates that no significant amount of biomass burning aerosols is located within the cloud. The temporal evolution of the aerosol absorption from POLDER can be divided in two periods. The ACSSA decreases from 0.89 in June to a minimum of 0.84 at the beginning of July. Then, a steady upward trend is observed reaching ACSSA = 0.92 in late October. From June to October, POLDER has retrieved a mean ACSSA of 0.87 ± 0.02. All five models reproduce the temporal evolution of the ACSSA, which is most likely due to the seasonal variation of biomass burning black carbon emissions. Simulations of ACSSA can be split into two groups. First, OsloCTM2 and SPRINSTARS give higher ACSSA estimations with mean values of 0.90 and 0.94. Second, the ACSSA derived from GOCART, HadGEM3, and ECHAM5-HAM2 are closer to POLDER with averages of 0.87, 0.87, and 0.86, respectively. However, no model reproduces the small ACSSA retrieved at the beginning of June. Note that it can be more difficult to retrieve the aerosol size distribution from polarized measurements for small aerosol load, which can impact the ACSSA estimation. In June, the extinction Ångström exponent is around 1.9 in this region, which is consistent with biomass burning particles. The low POLDER ACSSA could also be explained by the increased burning activity in Namibia due to the early-dry season burn policy introduced there in 2006.Time series of the ACAOT and ACSSA at 550 nm over the SEAO 5°N–30°S, 20°E–20°W for the fire season 2006. Each point corresponds to a 10 day average. The gray zone corresponds to the POLDER retrieval uncertainty.We now focus on August and September, when the aerosol load above clouds is largest. Figure  2 shows the POLDER and the modeled ACAOT and ACSSA. POLDER retrieves the largest ACAOT next to the coast for latitudes between 0°S and 10°S. Averaged ACSSA lower than 0.86 are observed between 10°S and 20°S close to the aerosol source and the ACSSA increases as the smoke outflow gets further from the coast. All models are able to represent the transport of aerosols to the ocean. This is partly because models nudged their meteorology to reanalyses. The spatial distribution of the ACSSA is better reproduced by HadGEM3 and OsloCTM2 than GOCART, which obtains the lowest ACSSA at latitudes under 20°S, associated with the lowest ACAOT. a ACAOT and b ACSSA at 550 nm over the SEAO from August to September 2006.Figure  3 shows the probability density function PDF of the CTH, the ACAOT and the ACSSA, respectively. The distribution of the POLDER CTH peaks at 1.1 km Figure  3 a , which is consistent with previous CALIOP observations in this region. The GOCART, HadGEM3, and OsloCTM2 CTH are close to the POLDER estimations. The ECHAM5-HAM2 and the SPRINTARS PDF peaks at lower altitudes i.e., around 0.6 km , and the distribution is wider in ECHAM5-HAM2. However, the CTH derived from the models is situated within a reasonably narrow range of values, which validates our detected of cloud layer in the models. a–c Probability density function PDF of aerosol and cloud properties in ACA scenes over the SEAO 5°N–30°S, 20°E–20°W for August to September 2006. Dashed gray lines correspond to the boundaries of the POLDER retrieval uncertainty for the ACAOT and the ACSSA. d PDF of clear-sky SSA. AERONET level 2 retrievals are compared with co-located SSA derived from AeroCom models for August to September 1995–2014 over Southern Africa 10°N–35°S, 40°E–10°W . Dashed gray lines correspond to the boundaries of the AERONET retrieval uncertainty for the SSA. List of AERONET sites: Bethlehem, Durban UKZN, Elandsfontein, Etosha Pan, Gorongosa, Inhaca, Joberg, Kaloma, Maun Tower, Mfuwe, Mongu, Mongu Inn, Mwinilunga, Ndola, Pietersburg, Pretoria CSIR-DPSS, Senanga, Sesheke, Skukuza, SKUKUZA AEROPORT, Solwezi, Wits University, and Zambezi .The POLDER ACAOT has a large temporal and spatial variability Figure  3 b , with a standard deviation SD of 0.23. It reveals that the presence of aerosols above clouds is due to sporadic particle plumes. Apart from OsloCTM2 that efficiently reproduces the POLDER PDF, the distributions of other models are too narrow and shifted to small ACAOTs. This lack of large aerosol loads above clouds is one reason that prevents these models from giving high instantaneous DRE values.In order to compare the ACSSA of events with the most important potential radiative impact, Figure  3 c shows only the ACSSA for 30% of events with the largest ACAOT. The POLDER distribution peaks at 0.87 ± 0.02, which covers both the GOCART and the HadGEM3 mean values 0.88 and 0.85 . The peaks of the ECHAM5-HAM2 and the OsloCTM2 distribution are close with averages of 0.84 and 0.90. The aerosols above clouds derived from SPRINTARS are the most scattering with a mean ACSSA of 0.94. The seasonal variations of the ACSSA are larger than retrieval errors with a SD of 0.023 ± 0.004. The spread of the GOCART and HadGEM3 distribution is consistent with POLDER SD of 0.025 and 0.023 . The variability of the ACSSA derived from ECHAM5-HAM2 is twice as large as that of POLDER SD = 0.046 . In contrast, the OsloCTM2 and SPRINTARS distributions are sharp SD of 0.010 and 0.016 . In order to assess the validity of the POLDER comparison, AERONET level 2.0 SSA retrievals for inland sites of Southern Africa 10°S–35°S, 10°E–40°E in August and September have been co-located with SSAs from models. The data set stretches from 1995 to 2014, which represents 483 successful retrievals. Figure  3 d displays the PDF obtained for clear-sky SSA. The distribution for ECHAM5-HAM2 is not shown because data were not available. The AERONET distribution peaks at a slightly lower SSA 0.85 than POLDER. In the same way, the modeled absorption is stronger in Figure  3 d than in Figure  3 c. Those differences may be due to aging processes during the aerosol transport from land to ocean. Also, clear-sky SSA characterizes the entire atmospheric column, unlike ACSSA which isolates the aerosol layer transported aloft. Otherwise, POLDER brings a similar constraint to AERONET, but with a much improved spatial coverage and much more observations. In summary, OsloCTM2 and SPRINTARS overestimate the SSA, while GOCART and HadGEM3 are closer to POLDER retrievals.The differences between the modeled ACAOT and ACSSA partly explain the large spread of the aerosol radiative impact over the SEAO. This comparison suggests that AeroCom models underestimate the aerosol DRE above clouds because they underestimate the amount of aerosols and/or overestimate the ACSSA. Diversity in modeled cloud albedo would also contribute, but the model distributions required are not available in AeroCom. The reasons of the diversity in the modeled aerosol optical properties above clouds are investigated further below.First, the diversity in the modeled ACAOT can result from differences in the aerosol removal processes and transport or in the injection of emissions. Lifetimes of organic carbon and black carbon BC aerosols are given in Table  1 . There is no correlation between aerosol lifetimes and ACAOT. Therefore, the underestimation of the ACAOT does not seem to come from too strong removal processes. However, global lifetimes are probably not representative of aerosols in the SEAO region. Additionally, we have analyzed the importance of the vertical aerosol profile. The aerosol vertical distribution has been qualitatively assessed near biomass burning sources 20°N–20°S, 20°E–30°E by calculating the mean extinction height has shown that only a small fraction of plumes reaches the free troposphere. Also, most of the source are located at altitudes higher than the marine boundary layer. In the absence of vertical transport, this implies that smoke is already injected at altitudes higher than the clouds. Consequently, differences in emission heights do not fully explain differences in modeled aerosol vertical profiles. The strength of the vertical transport, which depends on the convection parameterization in models, also controls the aerosol vertical distribution, suggesting that model calibration is necessary.Second, our study reveals the large diversity in the modeled ACSSA. ECHAM5-HAM2 and HadGEM3 are the models that better reproduce both the spatial distribution and mean of the ACSSA. Both models prescribe a high imaginary part of the BC refractive index 0.71 following the recommendation of Bond and Bergstrom . In contrast, the BC prescription of GOCART and SPRINTARS is less absorbing with an imaginary part of the refractive index of 0.44, based on the WCP model. OsloCTM2 has combined properties for BC and organic aerosols OA and its SSA for aged biomass burning aerosols is 0.91 at low relative humidity. The mass ratio of BC to OA also affects the SSA. Column-integrated BC:OA ratio for August–September over the SEAO is similar for HadGEM3, OsloCTM2, and SPRINTARS 5.4%, 6.2%, and 6.1%, respectively , confirming that differences in the modeled ACSSA come from the prescription of the BC refractive index. To quantify the impact of the BC:OC ratio, Mie calculations of the SSA have been performed, assuming a single mode lognormal number size distribution with a geometric mean radius of 0.12 µm and a standard deviation of 1.30, which is consistent with the measurements performed during the SAFARI 2000 campaign for aged biomass burning aerosols. For a BC:OA ratio of 5.5%, the SSA is 0.91 when the WCP refractive index of BC is used, as in SPRINTARS, but decreases to 0.86 with the more recent BC prescription, as in HadGEM3. ECHAM5-HAM2 and GOCART have a higher BC:OA ratio 11.8% and 7.8% . For a ratio of 7.5%, the SSA obtained with the less absorbing BC prescription is 0.88. It decreases to 0.82 when the more absorbing BC refractive index is considered. Therefore, using a recent BC prescription allows reproducing the low SSA observed by POLDER. In addition, the low ACSSA modeled by GOCART for small ACAOT are attributed to the large contribution of BC to the aerosol load. At latitude lower than 20°S, the BC:OA ratio is around 8.7%. It could be caused by an over-efficient BC vertical dispersion for GOCART and an underestimation of removal processes. The ACSSA of ECHAM5-HAM2 is larger than expected from its large BC:OA ratio because of contributions of third-party species like sea salt or sulfate.Multidirectional polarized and total radiance measurements from POLDER/PARASOL provide sensitivity to the scattering and the absorption of aerosol layers located above liquid clouds. A method has been developed to retrieve the ACAOT and ACSSA and the aerosol-corrected COT when the cloud is homogeneous and optically thick. Retrieved aerosol properties have been compared with AeroCom modeled properties over the SEAO during the fire season 2006. This region is a good test bed for the representation of aerosols in cloudy skies in climate models: the absorbing biomass burning aerosols, frequently observed above clouds, are expected to have an important radiative impact that is currently poorly constrained.Five AeroCom models have been compared to POLDER, using vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction, the aerosol absorption, and the CF. This analysis demonstrates that the properties of aerosols above clouds are associated with a large variability in the models. The ACAOT is underestimated by four of them, which is likely due to the vertical transport calibration and lower aerosol emission altitudes. This issue is currently analyzed through the Biomass Burning Emissions Experiments of the AeroCom Phase III. The comparison also reveals that models with more absorbing BC tend to better reproduce the low ACSSA observed by POLDER. By either underestimating the aerosol load or the aerosol absorption, all five models underestimate the ACAAOT, suggesting an underestimation of the aerosol DRE over the SEAO. This study demonstrates the usefulness of POLDER retrievals in constraining key aerosol parameters in global aerosol models. The comparison notably highlights the importance of injection heights, vertical transport, and BC refractive index prescription in reproducing the aerosol optical properties above clouds over the SEAO.The aerosol properties are not the only parameter that determines the aerosol DRE above clouds. The accurate knowledge of the cloud albedo is also important. When additional information about the cloud vertical profile is provided by the models e.g., the liquid and the frozen water content and the COT , a comparison with POLDER will become possible since the ACA method allows the retrieval of the aerosol-corrected COT as well.Finally, a global comparison of aerosol properties above clouds would increase the understanding of the factors responsible for model variability. However, the reliability of the method used to select aerosols above clouds in models has only been tested over the SEAO, where the stratocumulus layer is well defined. The use of the CF vertical profile to define the cloud layer becomes difficult for complex cloud covers such as mixed phase clouds or heterogeneous clouds. Once again, additional cloud information is necessary to perform such an analysis."
9,dust impact particles aerosol,"Do MODIS-defined dust sources have a geomorphological signature?. The preferential dust source PDS scheme enables large-scale mapping of geomorphology in terms of importance for dust emissions but has not been independently tested other than at local scales. We examine the PDS qualitative conceptual model of surface emissivity alongside a quantitative measurement of dust loading from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS Deep Blue Collection 6 for the Chihuahuan Desert. The predicted ranked importance of each geomorphic type for dust emissions is compared with the actual ranked importance as determined from the satellite-derived dust loading. For this region, the predicted variability and magnitude of dust emissions from most surface types present coincides with the observed characteristics demonstrating the significance of geomorphological controls on emission. The exception is for areas of low magnitude but persistent emissions such as alluvial surfaces where PDS overpredicts dustiness. As PDS is a good predictor of emissions and incorporates surface dynamics it could improve models of future dust emissions. Plumes of mineral dust are emitted into the atmosphere from source regions with specific geomorphological properties. In addition to influencing emission processes, composition, and fluxes, land surface properties are a key control on the nature of mineral aerosol. Specifically, physical and chemical properties of dust aerosols that determine the strength of interactions between dust and radiation, as well as with cloud microphysics and biogeochemistry, are modulated by the nature of sediments in source areas. Human activities also significantly affect erodibility, and thus dust emission.Satellite remote sensing has been instrumental in establishing the global distribution of dust sources. The methodology consists of attributing source areas to locations associated with the most frequent dust detection, independently of land surface characteristics. At this global scale, the major terrestrial dust source regions are identified as internally draining basins in semiarid and arid regions; however, it is acknowledged that most basins include a mosaic of different land surface types with different propensities to emit dust. Several studies have examined the relative contributions of landforms within major dust-emitting basins, e.g., Lake Eyre Basin, Australia, southern Africa, the eastern Great Basin and Southern High Plains, USA, and North American Chihuahuan Desert. Such studies, alongside field investigations, have demonstrated the variable contributions from different land surface types, highlighting the importance of this variability for understanding the dynamics of dust source regions as a whole. To reflect the variable dust emissivity of different land surfaces, a geomorphology-based classification known as the Preferential Dust Source scheme was developed. The preferential dust source PDS comprises a suite of geomorphological classes defined by their differing potentials to emit dust. To date, however, there has been little independent examination of whether surfaces predicted to be important for dust emissions actually coincide spatially with areas identified as dust sources using satellite remote sensing.To address this, our paper analyzes the geomorphic properties associated with dust sources in the Chihuahuan Desert by comparing a long-term remote sensing aerosol data set with the PDS geomorphology-based potential dust emission scheme. We use an updated version of MODIS Deep Blue inventory, with its advantages of being recent, global, and offering a decade of highly spatially resolved daily data. Determining whether land surface types that are predicted to be persistent dust sources are actually identified as such in the long-term MODIS dust loading record provides a first regional- and decadal-scale validation of the approach. The land surface mapping and aerosol data sets we use are independent, with no overlap between the data used to create them. Investigating the relationship between the two data sets tests a qualitative conceptual model of surface emissivity against a quantitative measurement of dust loading.The PDS scheme provides an improved method of representing the land surface amenable to large-scale dust modeling efforts. PDS suggests, via sedimentology, soil properties and the key limitations to emissions associated with different types of geomorphology e.g., sediment supply and availability , that certain land surfaces are more persistent and favored dust sources than others. The scheme holds that ephemeral and dry lakes, and unarmored, unincised alluvial surfaces of high relief have highest potential to be persistent dust emission sources. Sources of moderate potential include unarmored low relief alluvial surfaces, sand sheet, and some aeolian dune systems. Stony surfaces e.g., desert pavement , alluvial surfaces with armoring, and bedrock or duricrusts are all unlikely to be dust sources.The relationship of the PDS scheme to observed dust activity has been assessed with reference to satellite-derived dust source point maps. While successful in pinpointing locations of active emission to a high degree of spatial resolution, point source mapping offers a limited representation of emission magnitude from different surfaces. Furthermore, the limitations of the approach preclude a complete sampling of dust source activity. Examining the relationship between the PDS classification and a broadscale, aerosol product-based mapping of dust loading offers an improved assessment of the scheme's ability to represent persistent emission sources. With its reliable, multiyear data set of dust observations, the latest version of MODIS Deep Blue provides the means to validate PDS.The PDS classification scheme has been successfully applied to several major dust-bearing regions, with its full conceptual development detailed by presented a range of C5.1 DOD thresholds at 0.25, 0.5, and 1, applicable to different regions. In optimizing for source identification in the CD and C6 DOD, we apply a DOD threshold of >0.75 to highlight sources. Interpreting FoO at this threshold increases confidence that areas defined spatially by high FoO are locations of persistent dust emission, rather than ambient dust or dust in transport e.g., land surfaces lying under the most common dust pathways . DOD > 0.75 also eliminates most areas with diffuse dust and surfaces not expected to emit dust e.g., open water .Figure  2 a shows the long-term mean distribution of FoO for DOD > 0.75 FoO D0.75 in the CD. Across the region, FoO is spatially variable, with the main regions of elevated FoO located north of 30°N and south of 28°N. The maximum FoO D0.75 in these regions is >10% of days for the 12 year period thus, DOD > 0.75 for > ~440 days . TOMS AI-based map of North American dust activity, with high activity to the north and south of a central area of relatively low activity. By identifying emission sources at higher spatial resolution, the M-DB2 approach adds significant detail to this broad pattern. As the M-DB2 data are independent of the PDS scheme, they can be used to determine whether those land surface types predicted to be persistent dust sources based on their geomorphology and sedimentology are actually associated with high mineral aerosol loadings in the long-term MODIS record.Numerous field campaigns and analyses of satellite data have highlighted ephemeral and dry lakes as important dust sources. Drawing upon these data and the sediments and sediment budget dynamics of these landforms, the PDS scheme predicts that they should be the most significant geomorphologies for dust emission. This prediction is confirmed here as ephemeral and dry lake classified areas in the CD are associated with the highest mean FoO in the long-term dust record Figure  3 . Conversely, the PDS scheme predicts that low-emission surfaces and stony ground will be the least significant dust source areas and that sand sheets have only medium- to low-emission potential. Again, this is confirmed as these geomorphologies in the CD are all associated with the lowest mean FoO Figure  3 .In the PDS scheme, the importance of sand dunes for dust emissions ranges from low to high depending on factors such as dune type, composition, history, and location. Active quartz dune fields comprising well-sorted sand are typically weak dust sources. This describes the sandy Dunas de la Soledad area in the CD 103.75°W, 27°N , appearing as a nonpersistent source area FoO < 0.5% Figure  2 a . However, overall, sand dunes in the CD are generally associated with a high but variable mean FoO, comparable to unconsolidated dry lake surfaces. In previous studies, some of the highest dust emissions associated with dunes have been identified in areas where there is interplay between dunes and dry or ephemeral lake surfaces because the dunes provide saltating grains for sandblasting of and dust generation from the lacustrine deposits. Such a juxtaposition of landforms occurs at White Sands gypsum dune field within the CD and also in the Lake Palomas basin where a sand sheet/nebkha dune field is adjacent to the lake sediments of El Barreal. Local FoO for these two dune-lake areas exceeds 5%. The variability of FoO associated with dune surfaces in the CD suggests that the wide range of predicted dust emissions from dunes in the PDS scheme is appropriate.PDS also predicts that a significant type of alluvial surface for dust emissions will be those of high relief that are unarmoured and unincised medium to high emissions 2d . In the CD this geomorphology was associated with low mean FoO values Figure  3 , suggesting that the PDS scheme overpredicts dust emission from this land type. One possible explanation for this comes from Floyd and Gill's ecosystem-based analysis of CD aeolian fluxes which demonstrated that while playas produce the most dust per unit area, shrublands broadly coincident with the “unarmored unincised high-relief alluvial” PDS class likely produce more dust overall due to their extent. This land type covers ~140,000 km 2 43% of the CD, and while the amount of dust emission during individual events is relatively low likely putting them below the DOD detection criterion , their larger spatial coverage and potential for high total aeolian mass flux may more than compensate for low emissivity. Reheis and Kihl similarly suggested that in North America's Great Basin and Mojave Deserts, alluvial regions produced a greater amount of dust overall than playas, despite lower emission rates, due to their greater areal extent.This paper focuses on whether geomorphological units can be differentiated by their persistence as dust sources at the decadal scale. We do not consider annual variability of dust emissions in the CD, but insights into longer timescale controls on dust source dynamics can be gained. The PDS scheme states that the majority of dust sources with medium-to-high importance for emission are sediment supply limited and prone to alternate between periods of intense dust activity fueled by a supply of sediment and periods of low dust emission due to a lack of sediment. This “switching on-switching off” dynamic results in highly variable dust emissions and, in the CD, is reflected in the pronounced variability of mean FoO for ephemeral lakes and both high- and low-relief unarmored alluvial surfaces 2d and 3d . However, variability in dust emissions can also be caused by fluctuations in transport capacity which can be regionally variable. For example, in the CD, two areas of low-relief, unincised, and unarmoured alluvial surface the Salt Basin and parts of Bolsón de Mapimí have been identified as emission hot spots while a large area with the same geomorphological characteristics centered on 105°W, 27°N has consistently low dust emissions. Although in a single regional dust event not all areas of similar geomorphology will emit simultaneously, this spatial variability would be expected to average out in multiyear dust records, yet this is not the case for this CD area. One explanation is that under contemporary conditions, the weather systems responsible for the fastest winds in the CD do not frequently penetrate south of ~30°N, as also evidenced by climatic reconstructions from northern CD playas which suggest that strong westerlies and Pacific frontal systems lose dominance at latitudes south of Lake Palomas . This lower transport capacity to the south, resulting in fewer exceedances of threshold velocity for entrainment, may help to explain the spatial variability in emission. In contrast, low-emission surfaces such as stony ground are typically sediment availability limited, a constraint on emission less subject to short-term change, as reflected in the low standard deviation of FoO for these surfaces Figure  3 .Intrageomorphological variations in emission exemplify the challenges to incorporating emission heterogeneity in dust models. The small scale of dust hot spots shown here is an issue for dust models, because they cannot resolve features with scale lower than the model grid. As dust emission is initiated when surface winds reach a threshold for wind erosion, assumption of a mean threshold by grid cell will produce lower emission than by including subgrid variability with lower values over easily erodible surfaces. Figure  2 b illustrates this by showing the proportion of gridded 1 × 1° cells occupied by medium or highly erodible surfaces. Our results suggest that significant improvement in dust modeling may be achieved by considering the fraction of ephemeral and dry lakes and alluvial surfaces due to their variability within each grid cell using a high-resolution data set and applying a lower threshold of wind erosion on these surfaces.The method used here also enables an examination of the relationship between not only persistence mean FoO for DOD > 0.75 but also long-term magnitude mean DOD > 0.75 of dust emissions from each surface class. This relationship is shown in Figure  4 , but to isolate the different geomorphologies, only data from those 0.1° cells where a single surface type was dominant >75% cell area are included.Average dust persistence FoO and magnitude DOD at DOD > 0.75 threshold, by geomorphology type. Mean values derived from 0.1° cells with >75% one geomorphology type.Of the 11 CD geomorphology classes, 7 had grid cells meeting the dominance criterion. Considering persistence and magnitude together, ephemeral lakes emerge as the most intense dust source. In comparison, dry unconsolidated lakes return a relatively low mean DOD and FoO, demonstrating the importance for emission magnitude of sediment supply provided by periodic inundations. While the mean DOD of sand sheets 5a is comparable to ephemeral lakes, their overall intensity is strongly mitigated by depressed FoO, similar to low-emission surfaces 7 . Dune-dominated cells 5b exhibit a moderate emission magnitude in terms of mean DOD, which together with an elevated FoO, reinforces the suggestion that sedimentological conditions modulate dust generation from dune systems. Unincised, unarmored alluvial surfaces of both high 2d and low relief 3d occupy appreciable areas of the CD, and the absence of emission from large portions of these surfaces Figure  2 a results in moderate overall magnitude. The low relief emerges as a more intense emitter, however, as its FoO is double that of the high-relief slopes.In summary, applying a long-term distribution of dust loading from remote sensing to a land surface classification in the Chihuahuan Desert confirms fundamental linkages between geomorphology and dust emission. By examining the persistence of dust detection associated with specific geomorphology types, the preferential nature of emission from certain surfaces is quantified, the incorporation of which can improve representation of the land surface in dust models. To date, however, while detailed geomorphological mapping has been achieved for some regions, there is no standardized methodology or data set for global-scale coverage. In working toward such coverage, a promising recent development in machine learning for classifying dust source land surfaces has recently been demonstrated by Lary et al .. The intercomparison of aerosol loading and mapped emission potential in the CD offers a first-order validation of the PDS scheme, highlighting at a detailed spatial resolution the relative significance of different surface types including the dominance of ephemeral lakes. This study established long-term spatial agreement between land surface classes and dust emission, but time-averaged dust distributions overlook the geomorphological and meteorological dynamics which are key to explaining seasonal and annual emission patterns. Inherent to the PDS classification is the temporal pattern of dust emission associated with each geomorphology type e.g., susceptibility to flooding and frequency of sediment supply , and having established the validity of the scheme spatially, the next step will be to explore how these temporal variations can be modeled."
10,dust,"Contribution of airborne microbes to bacterial production and N-2 fixation in seawater upon aerosol deposition. Aerosol deposition may supply a high diversity of airborne microbes, which can affect surface microbial composition and biological production. This study reports a diverse microbial community associated with dust and other aerosol particles, which differed significantly according to their geographical air mass origin. Microcosm bioassay experiments, in which aerosols were added to sterile 0.2 mu m filtered and autoclaved SE Mediterranean Sea SEMS water, were performed to assess the potential impact of airborne bacteria on bacterial abundance, production, and N-2 fixation. Significant increase was observed in all parameters within a few hours, and calculations suggest that airborne microbes can account for one third in bacterial abundance and 50-100% in bacterial production and N-2-fixation rates following dust/aerosol amendments in the surface SEMS. We show that dust/aerosol deposition can be a potential source of a wide array of microorganisms, which may impact microbial composition and food web dynamics in oligotrophic marine systems such as the SEMS. Low-nutrient low-chlorophyll LNLC marine provinces occupy 50–60% of the ocean's surface areas. These oligotrophic regions are usually dominated by small-size pico-phytoplankton and by fast microbial recycling of nutrients. Future climate change scenarios predict warmer, more stratified, and larger LNLC regions, reducing nutrient availability to the photic zone.The supply of new nutrients from external sources such as atmospheric deposition to LNLC regions has been studied through model simulations, as well as laboratory and onboard experiments simulating dust/aerosol addition scenarios. These studies show that atmospheric inputs may provide limiting macronutrients nitrate and phosphate and micronutrients trace metals required to sustain productivity reviewed in or can supply toxic metals and other pollutants.In addition to supplying chemical constituents, aerosols also supply a wide array of airborne microbes. A considerable fraction 1–25% of these microbes remains viable during transport. Despite this, only a handful of studies focus on ecological implications of airborne microbes in marine ecosystems.The SE Mediterranean Sea SEMS is a stratified ultraoligotrophic LNLC environment, with extremely low surface dissolved inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. One of the main external sources for nutrients in this LNLC system is atmospheric depositions. Previous studies showed that nutrient release from aerosol deposition triggered an increase in primary and bacterial production rates and caused a shift in the relative abundance of small-size cyanobacterial communities.To date, the role of airborne microbes play in the LNLC SEMS, which is subject to high atmospheric dust/aerosol deposition rates, is unclear. In this study, we characterized the genetic fingerprinting of microorganisms attached to aerosols from representative storm events of different geographical origins Sahara, Eastern Europe, Middle East , collected between 2006 and 2012. Aerosol dust addition bioassay experiments in sterile seawater were used to evaluate the viability of airborne bacteria and their heterotrophic production and dinitrogen N 2 fixation rates.Aerosols from seven dust storm events were collected using a high-volume sampler at a flow rate of 42 m 3  h −1 for 12–60 h located on the roof of the Israel National Institute of Oceanography latitude 32.28°N, longitude 34.95°E , between 2006 and 2012, representing different geographical origins. Aerosols were collected on preweighted, acid-washed Whatman 41-filters high-quality cotton linters, GE Healthcare . An additional dust sample was collected during a dust storm event using precleaned glass plates at the same site on February 2015. Back trajectories arriving at the study site have historically been divided into up to six sectors. However, for the current study, a simpler three sector categorization was adopted Figure 1 a : i northern East Europe airmasses relatively lower crustal to anthropogenic contributions , ii southwestern high crustal Sahara desert air masses, and iii southern high crustal Middle East air masses. Three-day back trajectories arriving at 500, 1000, and 3000 m altitude levels were calculated for each sample, commencing at 10:00 UTC using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory HYSPLIT model from the Air-Resources Laboratory. a Representative air mass back trajectories analyses derived from backward trajectories model NOAA/ARL HYSPLIT-4 www.noaa.gov showing the course and origin of the aerosols used in this study over the course of three days prior its collection at 500 m above sea level.

A Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index for beta-diversity comparison between relative OTUs across the different aerosol samples is shown in Table S2 .Nine aerosol-enrichment microcosms in triplicates were carried out in 1-L acid washed polycarbonate Nalgene bottles using sterile 0.2 µm filtered and autoclaved-killed surface SEMS water. Subsamples 2.5 cm 2 from each of the seven aerosol filters were added to the microcosm bottles, which were shaken and put in an outdoor pool with seawater flow-through to maintain ambient temperature and covered with a neutral density screening to simulate ambient light for 48 h. These additions represent 1.5–1.8 mg L −1 of aerosol concentrations. Blank treatments were carried out, containing either an acid-washed Whatman-41 filter or UV-killed 24 h aerosols. Subsamples of water 20 mL from each incubation bottle were collected for bacterial production and abundance measurements 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 24, 30, and 48 h after aerosol addition.Additional bioassay microcosm experiment was conducted in triplicate using dust collected by glass plate in February 2015, which was originated in the Sahara desert dash line, Figure 1 a . Dust was added 1.5 mg L −1 to 4.5 L acid washed polycarbonate Nalgene into sterile surface SEMS water as described above. After 48 h incubations under ambient light and temperature conditions, the treatments were sampled for bacterial production, bacterial abundance, and dinitrogen N 2 fixation.Community genomic nucleic acids were extracted from the seven dust samples Table S1 in the supporting information using the phenol-chloroform method modified according to. The universal eubacterial primers 27 F and 338R were used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene region. Polymerase chain reaction products for the 16S fractions were sequenced to get a representative view of the bacterial community composition in each filter using Roche 454 FLX titanium instruments and reagents. Sequences were processed and analyzed using “quantitative insights into microbial ecology” QIIME , open-source software pipeline. See supporting information for further details.Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index for beta-diversity comparison between relative operational taxonomic unit OTU across aerosol samples was calculated with the QIIME “beta_diversity.py” script.Samples 1 mL for bacterial abundance were collected, fixed with 50% glutaraldehyde 0.15% final conc. v/v., Sigma G7651 , and incubated in room temperature for 10 min and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Prior to counting, samples were fast thawed at 37°C and stained with 0.5 nM SYTO9 Applied-Biosystems in the dark for 15 min. Samples were analyzed with an Attune acoustic focusing flow cytometer Applied-Biosystems equipped with a syringe-based fluidic system at a wavelength of 520 nm and a flow rate of 25 μL min −1 . Size standard was set using 0.93 µm beads Polyscience .Rates were estimated using the 3 H-leucine Amersham, specific activity: 160 Ci mmol −1 incorporation method. A conversion factor of 1.5 kg C mol −1 leucine incorporated was used, assuming an isotopic dilution of 2.0.

See supporting information for further details.Principle component analysis of the rRNA diversity from the different aerosol sources were generated using the XLSTAT software. Changes in bacterial abundance, production, and N 2 fixation rates in the different aerosol treatments were evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance ANOVA , followed by a Fisher LSD multiple comparison post hoc test with a confidence of 95% that reported an increase in bacterial abundance following dust deposition in sterile lake waters, however, that was only after 4–5 days and the increase was larger 100-fold . The differences between the studies may result from different airborne bacterial communities, aerosol chemical properties, atmospheric transport processes, and ambient water characteristics. Regardless, the fast and significant demonstrated that dust might pick up microorganisms along its route through the adhesion of microbe-laden fine aquatic sprays to dust particles.While several studies have shown that desert dust contains airborne bacteria references herein and reviewed by. Thus, in times of high atmospheric deposition, as in the case of the aerosols collected and examined here, airborne bacteria can be important contributors in the SEMS surface especially in the top microlayer water's microbial loop.The bacterial abundance, and more so the activity data, illustrates the potential involvement of airborne microbes in diverse ecological functions in seawater. One possible ecological function of airborne bacteria is exemplified in the N 2 fixation rates, showing that aerosol-associated diazotrophs can become active and fix N 2 Figure 3 . Aerosol addition collected in February 2015 into sterile SEMS water significantly increased N 2 fixation rates after 24 h incubation but also by adding actual diazotrophs. However, this ecologically important topic requires more research, including the use of molecular tools to identify which airborne diazotroph actually fixes N 2 following deposition cDNA , under what circumstances, and how common is this phenomenon.Dinitrogen N 2 fixation rates following the addition of aerosol collected during February 2015 to sterile SEMS water.

The percent change is normalized to 1.5 mg L −1 aerosol addition; the asterisk represents significant statistical difference α  = 0.05 .Climate change and desertification may increase dust storm events and frequencies in vast areas of the ocean. Several studies have shown that these dust/aerosol particles can act as a long-range mobilization vector for microorganisms, including of rare bacterial taxa. Yet to date, very little is known about the potential impacts of airborne microbes upon deposition into marine ecosystems and about their influence on biogeochemical processes. Further, the mechanisms that enable airborne bacterial populations to cope with the ambient microbial populations, and possibly outcompete them, are currently vague. It is possible that airborne bacteria are fast utilizers of organic carbon and inorganic nutrients, have toxic/allelopathic/pathogenic functions, or that they can synergistically cooccur with ambient microbial populations. We address here some of these issues demonstrating that aerosols from different geographical sources Figure 1 a can carry unique consortia of heterotrophic microorganisms Figures 1 b and 1 c . We assume that the harsh environmental conditions during transport likely act as an environmental filter, thus only specialized taxa, possibly with protecting mechanisms such as high DNA GC content, sporulation, or accumulation of photo-protecting pigments, can remain viable. Thus, biogeographical aspects are important controlling factors that will possibly introduce new system functions and should be studied both spatially and temporally. This might be especially important in the SEMS, where increase in atmospheric deposition intensity and frequency is expected. Our results also demonstrate that some of the airborne microorganisms exhibit high cell-specific activity Figure S2 , allowing interactions with ambient microbial populations immediately upon deposition. Furthermore, we show that airborne bacteria are active, fixing both carbon Figure 2 , and nitrogen Figure 3 . Dinitrogen fixation mediate by airborne microbes can contribute to the current debate on factors controlling this process in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as to the biogeochemical role of atmospheric deposition in LNLC regions.Finally, desert dust/aerosols usually carry small-size autotrophic cyanobacteria, fungi, and viruses. These organisms may have additional ecological implications in the ocean, including on microbial composition, or may affect marine organisms via pathogenesis.Taken together, dust/aerosols dispersal can be a potential source of a wide array of organisms, which may impact microbial composition and food web dynamics in marine environments. These potential ecological roles are just beginning to be recognized and should be taken into account in future studies when estimating the impact of dust in surface marine environments."
11,dust climate aerosol ocean,"Influence of anthropogenic aerosol deposition on the relationship between oceanic productivity and warming. Satellite data and models suggest that oceanic productivity is reduced in response to less nutrient supply under warming. In contrast, anthropogenic aerosols provide nutrients and exert a fertilizing effect, but its contribution to evolution of oceanic productivity is unknown. We simulate the response of oceanic biogeochemistry to anthropogenic aerosols deposition under varying climate from 1850 to 2010. We find a positive response of observed chlorophyll to deposition of anthropogenic aerosols. Our results suggest that anthropogenic aerosols reduce the sensitivity of oceanic productivity to warming from -15.21.8 to -13.31.6PgCyr -1 degrees C-1 in global stratified oceans during 1948-2007. The reducing percentage over the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Indian Oceans reaches 40, 24, and 25%, respectively. We hypothesize that inevitable reduction of aerosol emissions in response to higher air quality standards in the future might accelerate the decline of oceanic productivity per unit warming. Marine net primary production NPP is a critical component of the Earth's carbon cycle, transferring some 50 Pg of carbon to the biosphere each year and important for sustaining the habitability of Earth. Field studies and model indicate a decline in oceanic NPP during 1998–2010, and this trend likely lasts throughout the twentieth century. The decline is attributed mainly to the increasing thermal stratification of ocean water columns, induced by anthropogenic global warming. This increase in stability reduces the supply of nutrients from subsurface waters, thereby inhibiting the growth of phytoplankton. The process is simulated by ocean biogeochemical model and is expected to continue further, reducing oceanic NPP. In contrast, anthropogenic aerosols provide nutrients to the surface oceans, which fertilize the phytoplankton and promote the oceanic NPP. For example, by assuming complete assimilation of N in carbon fixation, estimated that contemporary deposition of anthropogenic nitrogen N can support a biological mediated carbon flux of ~0.3 Pg C yr −1 or ~3% relative to all new production in the oceans. A recent modeling study suggests that adding anthropogenic N and iron Fe deposition together can increase oceanic NPP by 1.5 Pg C yr −1 and reduces atmospheric CO 2 level by ~2.2 ppm by the year 2100. However, the impact of anthropogenic aerosol deposition AAD has not been simulated with the impact of climate change on stratification together in these models. used a coupled carbon climate model to study the effects of direct aerosol radiative forcing and Fe input from desert dust on the change of oceanic NPP under climate-induced changes in ocean. One of their main findings is that oceanic NPP increases following the input of Fe from desert dust and decreases as a consequence of the radiative effect of aerosols. In the present study, we quantify the fertilizing effect of anthropogenic aerosol deposition i.e., not only Fe from dust on the trend of oceanic NPP under realistic climate over the last decades. Our purpose is to test the hypothesis that anthropogenic aerosol deposition can provide substantial nutrients and partly offset the decline of NPP caused by warming. To understand the impact of AAD, we simulated the change of N, Fe, and phosphorus P deposition from 1850 to 2010 in a global atmospheric general circulation model and input the results into an ocean biogeochemical model with the varying climate.In this study, we compiled 182,552 in situ measurement data for the concentration of chlorophyll and the INCA INteraction with Chemistry and Aerosols, version 4 an aerosol module. This combination was run to simulate the global atmospheric emissions, transport, and deposition of N, P, and Fe. The models have been described in our previous papers and detailed in Text S1 .The emissions of N, P, and Fe were compiled from 1850 to 2010. Global 0.5° × 0.5° gridded monthly emissions of ammonia NH 3 and nitrogen oxides NO x from combustion and agriculture from 1850 to 2010 were taken from the ACCMIP and MACCity inventory; the emissions of nitrogen oxide NO from soil and NH 3 from natural soils and oceans were estimated for present day in our model and assumed to be constant. The emissions of P and Fe from energy-related combustion and wildfires were estimated from 1960 to 2007. These emissions were extrapolated by country from 1960 to 1850–1959 based on the sulfur emissions less relying on technology change in ACCMIP and from 2007 to 2008–2010 based on the black carbon emissions sharing similar sources as P or Fe in MACCity. The emissions of P and Fe from energy-related combustion were assumed to be constant throughout each year without seasonal variations. The monthly emissions from wildfires were calculated for 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 using the seasonal profile of black carbon emission from wildfires in each year, for 2010 using the seasonal profile of black carbon emission from wildfires averaged over 2001–2008 and for 1850 using the seasonal profile of black carbon emission from wildfires averaged for 1960–1969. Then, the monthly emissions of P and Fe in each country were disaggregated to 0.5° × 0.5° grids using the 0.5° × 0.5° distribution of corresponding black carbon emission. The monthly emissions of Fe from dust averaged over 2000–2011 and of P from dust averaged over 2000–2011 , primary biogenic aerosol particles 2000 , and volcanoes 1990 were assumed to be constant throughout our study period, to isolate the impact of anthropogenic emissions.We specified that 10% of P from dust, 100% of P from volcanoes, and 50% of P from other sources are converted to phosphate PO 4 , which is bioavailable. In addition, we applied the measured Fe solubility of 12 ± 9% for coal fly ash, 63.0 ± 17.0% for vehicle oil fly ash, 79.8 ± 8.5% for heavy oil fly ash, 30 ± 14% for biomass ash, and 2 ± 4% for dust to convert Fe to sFe, which is bioavailable. Snapshot simulations were performed to produce the monthly deposition of NO 3 and NH 4 , PO 4 , and sFe in 1850 and for snapshot years every tenth year from 1960 to 2010. All simulations were performed under present-day climate conditions nudging with the meteorological data for 2005. The atmospheric deposition rates of NO 3 and NH 4 , total Fe, and total P have been validated by in situ measurements. The modeled surface-air concentrations of Fe and sFe have been validated by in situ measurements over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We performed a linear interpolation to obtain the deposition by month for each year between the two snapshot years.The monthly deposition of NO 3 and NH 4 , PO 4 , and sFe was prescribed in a state-of-the-art oceanic biogeochemical model NEMO-PISCES version 2 , used to simulate the fate of nutrients N, P, Fe, and silicon and the carbon cycle in global oceans. The model can well capture the observed response of oceanic NPP to both dust and climatic variability. The model version and external sources of nutrients are detailed in Text S1 . Major sources of DIN, PO 4 , and sFe in the ocean are shown in Table S1 .In our study, the NEMO-PISCES model was run from 1768 to 2007, with the first 180 years as a spin-up. Simulations were forced by prescribed atmospheric levels of CO 2 from 1768 to 2007. Following Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments Phase II protocol, the recorded ocean forcing data from 1948 to 2007 were used as input for the oceanic physical model, and the data were repeated in each 60 year period Supporting Text . The monthly atmospheric deposition of NO 3 and NH 4 , PO 4 , and sFe was prescribed to the model. The simulation results were analyzed for the last 60 years from 1948 to 2007 with recorded forcing data.We ran two simulations to study the impact of AAD: a control simulation CTL with the deposition fixed at the 1850 levels and an experimental simulation DEP with the deposition varying from 1850 to 2007. The difference was considered as the response to AAD.Global emissions of reactive N N r , including NH 3 and NO x , PO 4 , and sFe for 1850–2010 are shown in Figures 1 a– 1 c. Total emissions of N r , PO 4 , and sFe have increased since 1850 by 181, 85, and 41%, respectively. Emissions of N r , mainly from fossil fuels and agriculture, increased until 1990 and then leveled off due to the use of emission control devices for vehicles and industry. The energy-related emissions of PO 4 increased due to increasing contribution of biofuels to energy supply in developing countries and to deforestation in South America and Southeast Asia. Emissions of sFe from combustion rose before 1990 due to increased coal use and declined thereafter due to the implementation of industrial dust abatement facilities and the burning of cleaner fuels in the 1990s.Atmospheric emissions and oceanic deposition of N, P, and Fe from 1850 to 2010. Emissions of a N r , b PO 4 , and c sFe from different sources “PBAPs” stands for primary biogenic aerosol particles . Oceanic deposition of d DIN, e PO 4 , and f sFe, for snapshot years dots . Previous estimates of deposition are shown as purple or yellow triangles.Emissions of N r , PO 4 , and sFe were prescribed in LMDZ-OR-INCA to obtain the oceanic deposition of dissolved inorganic N DIN, including NO 3 and NH 4 , PO 4 , and sFe in 1850 and for annual snapshots every 10 years from 1960 to 2010 Figures  1 d– 1 f . Oceanic deposition of DIN, PO 4 , and sFe has increased since 1850 by 137, 40, and 46%, respectively, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. Deposition of DIN, PO 4 , and sFe has increased by 310 260% , 0.52 110% , and 0.28 200%  pmol m −2  s −1 , respectively, over the North Pacific and by 300 230% , 0.11 18% , and 0.030 6%  pmol m −2  s −1 , respectively, over the North Atlantic Figure S2 . Our calculated DIN and sFe deposition is comparable to previous studies, but our PO 4 deposition is higher due to larger P emissions for combustion sources.NEMO-PISCES includes two types of phytoplankton, namely, nanophytoplankton and diatoms. The model simulates. Hereafter, all results were derived by considering nanophytoplankton and diatoms together unless specified. Generally, the model accurately reproduces the spatial pattern of nutrient limitation of oceanic NPP for nanophytoplankton Figures  2 a and 2 b . Over 1948–2007, the primary limiting nutrient for nanophytoplankton changes with an expansion of ocean areas limited by N, which took up 54% of total oceans in 1948–1977 and 57% in 1978–2007. In NEMO-PISCES, N is consumed by denitrification under suboxic conditions. It is likely that the projected declining oxygen content under warming enhanced denitrification and caused a more stringent N limitation in the oceans Figure S3 . The model, however, does not properly resolve the observed colimitation by N and P over the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. Globally, 42% of the ocean is N limited, similar to the 40% area found previously; most of the remaining ocean is Fe limited. The pattern of nutrient limitation changes slightly from CTL to DEP corresponding to an alteration from N to P limitation in coastal oceans with high N depositions. In addition, we find an expansion of high-limitation region from DEP to CTL contour lines in Figures  2 a and 2 b .Impact of AAD on nutrients,. Influence of AAD on the modeled c DIN, d sFe, e PO 4 , and f i with or j without w/o AAD. Plots are made in a log scale, with colors indicating the density of data in the panel. Number of sites estimated that anthropogenic N and Fe deposition can increase oceanic NPP by 1.5 Pg C yr −1 . In comparison, by performing a sensitivity simulation with anthropogenic P only, we found that the oceanic NPP in 2007 decreased by 1.3 Pg C yr −1 relative to the DEP simulation, close to the estimate by. However, some differences between our study and previously published results should be noted. For instance, our model predicts a different nutrient limitation spatial pattern over the subtropical North Atlantic in comparison with the one from which suggests a large area limited by P under modern conditions. noticed that P can be seriously depleted over oligotrophic oceans in this region, but they noticed that adding P alone does not enhance NPP in deck incubations. assumed that P and Fe limitations can limit carbon fixation indirectly by limiting N fixation, but this effect is very sensitive to the N:Fe ratio in diazotrophic organisms. Therefore, the nutrient colimitation should be better examined and studied in the future ocean models, and the effect of Fe could be underestimated if a high N:Fe ratio assumed by is confirmed.The spatial pattern of modeled NPP is comparable to satellite-based estimates for 1997–2007 Figure S5 . The period covered by satellite observations is relatively short and corresponds to an era of intense anthropogenic aerosol emissions, making it difficult to detect the effect of AAD. In addition, the NPP difference modeled with or without AAD Figure S5d is very small relative to the total, making it difficult to identify a better or worse agreement between model and remote sensing data. Instead, we evaluated our model using in situ between DEP and CTL is >10%, the NMB and RMSD were reduced from −42% and 0.24 to −32% and 0.17 found an inverse relationship of increasing sea surface temperature SST with decreasing NPP in the permanently stratified oceans from 1999 to 2004. We observed a similar relationship when comparing the period from 1948–1977 to 1978–2007 Figure S10 . Furthermore, the correlations are equally as high with or without AAD Figure  3 , but including AAD decreases the sensitivity of NPP changes to SST changes. The slope of modeled NPP to observed SST decreased from −15.2 ± 1.8 without AAD to −13.3 ± 1.6 with AAD  Pg C yr −1  °C −1 , a reduction by 12.5% relative to that without AAD. The North Pacific has the largest change from −2.56 ± 0.46 to −1.96 ± 0.40 Pg C yr −1  °C −1 . The sensitivity of NPP to SST in the North Atlantic was reduced by 40% −0.35 ± 0.10 to −0.21 ± 0.10 Pg C yr −1  °C −1 by including AAD; this reduction was the largest, followed by the Indian Ocean 25% and the North Pacific Ocean 24% . This percentage quantifies the offset of NPP sensitivity to SST by AAD. It depends on the response of NPP to AAD, as well as the sensitivity of NPP to SST. The largest percentage of change over North Atlantic is mainly due to the lowest NPP sensitivity to SST in the region.Relationship between annual NPP and SST for 1948–2007. NPP is computed in the model and SST is from the observations. a The permanently stratified oceans defined by are divided into b North Pacific, c North Atlantic, and d Indian Oceans. The circles show the relationship between NPP and SST under warming alone red or warming and AAD together blue . The slope of NPP to SST Pg C yr −1  °C −1 and coefficient of determination found that the response of marine biota to a pulse change of atmospheric dust or N deposition occurs rapidly, while the duration of the perturbation is short from a few days to two weeks in the low nutrient low-chlorophyll LNLC oceans. We infer that marine biota in the LNLC oceans adjust rapidly to the AAD variation, in particular for deposition of N with a short turnover time <1 month .In order to obtain a long-term effect of aerosols on ocean biogeochemistry, our estimate is subject to several sources of uncertainty, which should be addressed in the future study. First, we prescribed constant Fe solubility for each source from measurements without accounting for variability of Fe solubility under diverse atmospheric and ocean conditions. Second, we did not include the emission of dust from land cover change, and the impact should be considered when this global source is better understood. Third, we did not derive the daily atmospheric input from 1850 to 2010 due to heavy computational load. As a result, the monthly resolution of nutrient deposition cannot capture episodic transport. Fourth, our model did not include the toxic effect of anthropogenic heavy metals. For example, predicted a remarkable toxic effect of anthropogenic copper over the Bay of Bengal and downwind of South and East Asia close to the land with a limited impact over the remote oceans.Marine ecosystems are sensitive to environmental changes. Global warming induced by greenhouse gases emissions has increased ocean stratification and reduced nutrient supply for phytoplankton in the surface ocean. The most important findings of our study are that 1 the fertilizing effects of aerosols should be considered along with the effects of climate change and variability in driving NPP variations and 2 anthropogenic N deposition dominates the fertilizing effect of aerosols. Nonetheless, the effects of Fe and P deserve more studies, in particular they can alter the N cycle in the oceans and impact on NPP. Our study identifies anthropogenic aerosols deposition as an overlooked factor that can compensate partly the decline of nutrients induced by warming. A recent study reported that ambient aerosol pollution led to ~3 million premature deaths in 2010, so these emissions will inevitably be controlled, likely before 2030 in the major emitting countries in Asia. According to the Representative Concentration Pathways scenarios, the emissions of NO x and sulfur sharing similar sources as P and Fe will decrease by 34–59% and 75–88% from 2010 to 2100, although ammonia will increase by 3–55%. If our analysis proves robust, higher air quality standards, while improving air quality, will reduce atmospheric deposition of nutrients and accelerate decline in oceanic NPP due to warming. Such changes will have impacts on marine food webs and the global carbon and nitrogen cycles and climate."
12,dust climate,"The importance of Harmattan surges for the emission of North African dust aerosol. Dust aerosol is important in the Earth system, but the relative impact of meteorological mechanisms on North African dust emission remains unclear. This study presents the first climatology of dust emission amounts associated with Harmattan surges HSs , characterized by postfrontal strengthening of near-surface winds. A new automated identification uses their strong isallobaric winds as an indicator for HSs in 32 years of ERA-Interim reanalysis. Their impact on dust aerosol emission is estimated by combining the identified events with derived dust emissions. The estimate highlights that about one third of the total emission mass is associated with HSs. Spring shows the largest associated emissions of 30-50% of the monthly totals consistent with the largest number and duration of HSs. Regional emission contributions of up to 80% in the north coincide with the overall largest emission maxima in spring. The importance of HSs for dust emission implies that aerosol-climate models need to accurately represent synoptic-scale storms. One of the largest uncertainties in understanding the Earth system is currently associated with aerosol. Mineral dust constitutes the largest fraction of aerosol mass in the troposphere and has a multitude of effects. These include effects on 1 the atmospheric transfer of radiation, 2 cloud properties and precipitation, 3 surface albedo and ecosystems, and 4 air quality and human health.Despite the importance of dust aerosol, climate and Earth system models have large uncertainties in dust emission. Improving dust simulations is difficult due to the scarcity of ground-based observations in remote desert regions. A key uncertainty in dust emission modeling is the near-surface wind speed, so that evaluating processes that drive these winds is a promising approach for model improvements. Different atmospheric processes are known for generating dust-emitting winds in North Africa, the largest and most active dust source on Earth. Recently, the assessment of their climatological importance has been started through identifying associated emission amounts. The results highlight nocturnal low-level jets NLLJs and convective cold pools as dust-emitting mechanisms with different seasonal and regional importance, but these do not explain the overall largest emission maximum along the northern fringes of the Sahara in winter and spring. Here mobile and long-lived cyclones occur but do not coincide with the majority of these emissions. It remains therefore unclear what process causes that emission maximum.The season and region point to a possible relevance of Harmattan surges HSs . HSs manifest themselves as postfrontal strengthening of near-surface winds accompanied by a band of strong isallobaric ageostrophic wind IW during an extratropical cold-air intrusion. Different regions are known for their occurrence, typically in the lee of mountains. HSs are associated with an upper level trough, schematically depicted in Figure  1 for North Africa. These are mostly positively tilted and present during 20% of the time in winter. Closer to the surface, HSs take the form of a trailing front typically to the west of an eastward moving cyclone Figure  1 a . An impressive HS occurred between 1 and 6 March 2004, shown in Figure  1 b. The equatorward advection of the extratropical air rapidly increases the near-surface pressure, which causes strong postfrontal near-surface winds. These mobilize dust that marks the front Figure  1 c . The decreasing Coriolis parameter toward the equator prevents a quick adjustment of the atmospheric flow, in contrast to higher latitudes, where the Coriolis force helps to limit the spatial impact of similar storms. In consequence, HSs propagate over long distances, activating dust sources across the entire North Africa Figure  1 d . The southward advection, e.g., indicated by the typical pressure pattern of HSs in, and trans-Atlantic transport of dust from HSs point to their wide influence. Despite their impact, a climatology of their occurrence and associated emission mass is missing.Schematic illustration of a, c a Harmattan surge and b, d an example from March 2004. Figures  1 a and 1 b show initiation of HS with strong isallobaric and geostrophic winds to the south of the Atlas Mountains. Figures  1 c and 1 d show subsequent long-trailing front and continental-scale dust emission. b, d Shown are geopotential height contours , geostrophic winds wind barbs , isallobaric winds shaded at 925 hPa, and total dust emission exceeding 10 −8  kg m −2  s −1 yellow and 10 −7  kg m −2  s −1 red during the last 3 h from ERA-Interim data.In the present article HSs are identified in reanalysis over 32 years with a new automated detection. The associated dust emission amount is estimated to better understand the relative importance of HSs compared to other mechanisms. The article is organized as follows. First, the HS detection and the data are described in section 2 . Second, a case study is presented as illustration of the method in section 3.1 followed by the mean annual cycle of HSs and their interannual variability sections 3.2 and 3.3 . Section 4 discusses the implications of HSs with respect to other processes, and section 5 presents conclusions.This study makes use of ERA-Interim reanalysis and forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Meteorological fields from the 6-hourly reanalysis with a horizontal resolution of 1° are used for the automated detection of HSs. ERA-Interim does not provide dust emission which is therefore calculated with the model by. The dust emission model is run with instantaneous near-surface winds and soil moisture from 3-hourly ERA-Interim forecasts, which sufficiently capture subdaily variability. These forecasts are initialized at 00 and 12 UTC with lead times of up to 12 h and simulate similar winds like the reanalysis product. The setup of the dust emission model follows previous studies. The modeled dust emissions and winds have been evaluated with available observations and intercompared with different models. A summary of these evaluations and further observational evidence is provided in the supporting information .HSs are defined by rapidly increasing postfrontal winds, typically affecting northwestern Africa initially and large parts of the Sahara thereafter. For their automated identification, IWs are calculated at 925 hPa, which are strong due to the rapid change in geopotential height in the postfrontal air. The spatial gradient in the IW is approximated by centered differences considering the neighboring grid boxes, while the geopotential height tendency is calculated over the previous 12 h. Using a period of 6 h gives rather noisy IWs and 24 h misses some peak intensities, such that 12 h has been chosen as compromise.A filter needs to be applied to avoid detections of spurious IW features. Based on sensitivity tests, HSs are successfully identified if the IW exceeds 7 m s −1 in at least five grid boxes in the area 25°–38°N and 15°W–30°E marked in Figure S1 a . The detection area is motivated by the initial influence on northern areas due to the equatorward intrusion of extratropical air. Regions where the 925 hPa level lies below the orography are excluded. The threshold of five grid boxes reflects the banded structure of strong IWs on the order of 500 km. Using a larger number eliminates spurious features but delays the HS detection to later stages such that associated emission at early stages would be missed. Consecutive identifications are treated like a single event in the statistical analysis.Dust emission from all North African sources is associated with an HS up to 36 h after the last detection. This time period is motivated by ongoing emissions at late stages, when slower pressure changes cause below-threshold IWs. The setup with these thresholds is termed M-7 hereafter. In total, four setups are shown as uncertainty measure: IWs exceeding 7 m s −1 7 and 9 m s −1 9 in at least five M and nine L grid boxes. The sensitivity to these thresholds is discussed with the climatology. Case studies illustrate the utility of the method next.The widely discussed HS in March 2004 is briefly investigated here and another three cases of variable strength in the supporting information . These HSs are qualitatively reproduced and successfully detected with the data and method used here.On 2 March 2004, a positively tilted upper level trough at 200 hPa is situated over northwest Africa with a strong subtropical jet streak Figure S1 g . At 925 hPa, high geopotential lies to the west of the trough and a depression is located over the Hoggar Mountains. The rapid pressure increase in the cool air over northwest Africa, indicated by positive tendencies in geopotential height at 200 hPa Figure S1 g , causes above-threshold IWs near the surface Figure  1 a . Strong near-surface winds mobilize dust successfully simulated here Figure  1 a . During the following night, the depression over the Hoggar Mountains shifts eastward and the HS propagates in southerly direction leading to more widespread intense emission over West Africa Figure  1 b . As the upper level trough moves eastward during the subsequent days Figures  S1 i– S1 l , the HS is associated with dust-emitting winds in more southern and eastern parts of the Sahara Figures  S1 b– S1 f . These emissions cause the dust suspended behind the long-trailing front as seen in satellite observations Figure  S2 . The continental-scale impact of HSs on emissions, like in March 2004 and 2006 Figures  1 b and 1 d and S1 and S2 , motivates the association of emissions from the entire North Africa. Even though this may be a generous assumption, case studies of detected short-lived events show substantially smaller associated emissions Figures  S3 – S5 despite using the same method for assigning emissions. This evidence is further supported by the climatology of HSs shown next.In order to reflect the variety in HS characteristics and the uncertainty in their detection, HS climatologies are shown for different thresholds Table S1 . M-7 events occur 34 times per year, 21 of which are particularly large L-7 at the time of first detection. M-9 and L-9 surges are less frequent with a total number of 12 and 6, respectively. Most of the events are detected in spring, shown by the annual cycle of the occurrence of HSs in Figure  2 a. The overall maximum of seven M-7 events occurs in April, more than half of which are particularly large L-7 but less than three with strong IWs exceeding 9 m s −1 M-9 . L-9 events are even less frequent with one event in the long-term mean for March and April. July and October have the fewest HSs, while winter months are characterized by three to four M-7 events.Mean annual cycle of HSs and associated emission. Shown are long-term monthly values of a total HS number, b mean HS duration, and c mean fraction of emission associated with HSs for different thresholds colors and total emission associated with M-7 HSs black for 1979–2010. L-9 events are too rare for deriving a mean duration.The number of occurrence does not allow a conclusion on the development and impact on emission of HSs; e.g., a strong HS could be short lived limiting the impact on emission compared to a moderately strong but long-lived case. This motivates an analysis of the duration of HSs. The duration is calculated as the monthly mean time difference between the first and last detection of above-threshold IWs. Figure  2 b shows that the annual cycle of the duration is similar to the number of events, suggesting that spring has the most frequent and the longest HSs so that their impact on dust emission is likely to be strongest. The maximum duration in April is 84 h for M-7 surges, 53 h for L-7, and 26 h for M-9. M-7 surges in winter last for 35–55 h which is in good agreement with the mean duration of the influence of upper level troughs.In the annual mean 32% of the total dust emission is associated with M-7 HSs, which corresponds to 133.3 Tg/yr Table S1 . Requiring stronger IWs in a larger area reduces the amount of associated emission to 10% for L-9 events, which is nevertheless substantial in light of only six L-9 HSs in the annual mean. In comparison, mobile cyclones are associated with 4% of the annual emission total but occur almost twice as frequently as L-9 HSs.Figure  2 c shows the annual cycle of the total and relative mass of dust emission associated with HSs. The contribution of M-7 events to emissions shows a clear maximum of 250 g m −2 in March which represents 50% of the dust mass in the long-term average across North Africa for this month. Three quarters of these emissions are associated with HSs that were initiated west of 15°E with an emission mean of 190 g m −2 in March not shown . Using more restrictive thresholds reduces the associated emission to a maximum contribution of 30% in March for L-9 events, which is substantial given their rare occurrence Figure  2 a . The maxima in associated emission occurs 1 month earlier than the maximum in the number of M-7 HSs Figure  2 a , reflecting the slightly fewer but more intense HSs and the larger total emission mass in March. The contribution from M-7 HSs decreases to 40% in May followed by a steep decline over the summer months in agreement with few identified events in this season. Dust emission associated with M-7 HSs increases from September onward but remains well below 40% until January. February emissions associated with HSs constitute 42% of the monthly totals corresponding to an amount of 140 g m −2 per month. This annual cycle is similar for all thresholds with increasing seasonal differences for larger associated emissions.The spatial distribution of emission associated with M-7 HSs highlights distinct differences between months, shown in Figure  3 . Associated emissions in January are mostly limited to areas north of 25°N with regional contributions of 20–80% to the total emission Figure  3 a , when only few HSs occur over the continent. Areas farther south show an increase in associated emission between February and May, when events are most frequently detected near the Atlas Mountains and over Libya Figures  3 b– 3 e . Particularly, March shows fractions of 30–80% of the total emission in association with HSs Figure  3 c . This is the time of year when HSs occur frequently and are particularly intense section 3.2.1 . Regional maxima in March are 66% for the rare L-9 events not shown underlining the large impact of HSs on emission even when more restrictive criteria are applied. These reductions for L-9 events occur primarily in the northwest not shown reflecting the later detection of HSs. June to October are comparably calm with the overall smallest contribution of less than 10% to the emission in August Figures  3 f– 3 j . November and December show again regional maxima in associated emission with 20–80% for M-7 events, but these are limited to smaller areas than at the beginning of the year Figures  3 k and 3 l . These patterns in monthly associated emissions are robust against changes in thresholds for the HS detection.Climatology of dust emission associated with Harmattan surges. Shown are long-term monthly means of fractions of total dust emissions associated with M-7 Harmattan surges shaded , isolines for IWs above 7 m s −1 for 0.5% light blue and 1% dark blue of the time during a HS, and orography in steps of 400 m. Values are calculated for 1979–2010 and not shown when the 925 hPa isohypse lies below the orography. Amounts in the bottom left corners are long-term means of total North African dust emission per month.Figure  4 a shows the time series of the annual total number of HSs, which indicate positive but insignificant trends Table  S1 . Circulation anomalies over North Africa can be influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation NAO , positive values of which indicate an unusually strong Azores High and thereby an above-average strength of Harmattan winds. However, the correlation coefficients of the anomaly of HS occurrence and the NAO index are low not shown for time series of both annual and monthly values as well as April values only, the time of their maximum occurrence frequency. This finding is in agreement with who show low correlations between the NAO index and the occurrence of upper level troughs associated with tropical plumes over North Africa.Time series of Harmattan surges. Shown are annual a total HS number per year and b anomalies in total dust emission black and in emission associated with L-9 HSs orange . Anomalies are calculated as annual total minus the long-term mean. Values are for different thresholds colors and based on ERA-Interim. Means and trends are listed in Table  S1 .Figure  4 b shows the time series of the annual emission anomalies, calculated as the difference between the annual totals and the long-term average of annual emissions for values associated with HSs and for values for all North African emission. This analysis allows one to categorize individual years relative to the climatological mean. The analysis highlights the overall largest anomaly in 2004 with 110 Tg more emission than usual. Relative to the long-term annual mean of 428 Tg/yr for 1979–2010, this anomaly corresponds to one quarter of the total emission of North Africa. M-7 HSs are the main contributors to this anomaly with 100 Tg. Likewise, maximum anomalies are found for all other thresholds pointing to the unusually strong impact of HSs in 2004.In order to assess the impact of individual events, emission anomalies are also calculated as monthly totals minus the long-term average of the same month not shown . March 2004 has a maximum anomaly of 45 Tg more emission than in the climatological mean. This value corresponds to almost half of the annual anomaly for 2004 compare Figure  4 b . Other HSs show a lower impact on emission; e.g., March 2006 and 2007 are associated with about 15 Tg emission more than usual. These results underline the potentially high but variable impact of HSs on total emission.The assessment of the importance of HSs for dust aerosol emission from a climatological perspective requires time-dependent and three-dimensional atmospheric data in combination with dust emission fluxes over a period of a few decades. Here ERA-Interim data and the dust emission model by have been chosen. A similar investigation based on observations alone would not be feasible. The emission data in the present work have been used for identifying other atmospheric processes and their associated dust emission amounts and as benchmark for model intercomparison studies. In the absence of long-term observations of the dust emission flux, the model performance has been evaluated by using field campaigns, quality-controlled radiosondes, satellite retrievals, and another reanalysis product, the results of which are summarized in the supporting information .Due to the sparse network of long-term quality-controlled observations in North Africa, a solid validation of near-surface winds and dust aerosol remains difficult. Some progress has been achieved through exploiting available observations, showing differences in winds from reanalysis and observations at single stations. However, the poor spatiotemporal observation coverage over North Africa and local influences on stations are sources for uncertainty, so that local measurements must not be representative for the regional grid box mean in the reanalysis. For instance, temporal mismatches of modeled and observed conditions can substantially impact sample statistics. Resolving this debate requires more long-term quality-controlled observations from the Sahara.The emission model in the present work has been developed and optimized for winds in coarse-resolution models. ERA-Interim provides the best near-surface winds among state-of-the-art reanalysis products. The derived emission shows the same seasonal pattern like another reanalysis wind data set, but the derived mass from ERA-Interim agrees better with other models. The performance of ERA-Interim is measured at synoptic scales. A misrepresentation of HSs therefore seems unlikely, evidence of which has been provided through case studies in the supporting information .A large fraction of the maximum in dust emission during spring has been associated with HSs. Their contribution to the total annual emission with 32% even exceeds the fraction associated with NLLJs of 15%, which is an important mechanism for North African dust mobilization. NLLJs play a comparably small role for emission along the northern fringes of the Sahara with typically 5–10% in winter and spring. Here HSs play the most important role for emitting dust aerosol with regionally up to 80%. Farther south NLLJs are associated with large emissions of up to 60% during winter and spring. Parts of them could be simultaneously associated with HSs strengthening NLLJs. For instance, dust storms over the Bodélé Depression are often associated with NLLJs. Observations show their strengthening due to HSs, but their impact on emissions is limited to the night and midmorning in contrast to HSs that affect emission throughout the day. The additional amplification of near-surface winds through the NLLJ mechanism therefore plays a small role for dust emission during a strong HS.Dust emission associated with mobile cyclones forming simultaneously with a HS could be interpreted as part of the same synoptic situation. Emissions associated with mobile cyclones are incorporated in the emission estimate for HSs here but are much smaller. show that winds within a 10° circle around the center of mobile cyclones mobilize 4% to the total emission amount in the long-term mean. This cyclone climatology could miss weakly defined open systems, a common feature of all automated cyclone detections so that climatologies differ. However, the method in identifies more cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere than other techniques, and deep cyclones are generally well captured. The assignment of emissions to mobile cyclones in uses a search radius for dust emission that is twice as large compared to a study identifying winds as an indicator for the storm intensity. Moreover, show that winds at 925 hPa in extratropical cyclones from ERA-Interim lie within the uncertainty of three other current reanalysis. A substantial underestimation of dust emission associated with mobile closed cyclones in seems therefore unlikely.The results suggest that HSs contribute substantially more to the total emission in winter and spring than mobile closed cyclones or the additional amplification through NLLJs. A stringent separation of the contributions of these mechanisms to emissions is, however, not useful for a generic classification, since they can be linked to the same synoptic situation. These interactions underline the overall importance of the synoptic-scale conditions for dust aerosol production in North Africa during winter and spring.This study statistically investigates the occurrence of Harmattan surges HSs and their impact on the North African dust emission mass for 1979–2010. With the aid of a new automated detection for HSs applied to ERA-Interim data, the first climatology of dust emission amounts associated with such storms has been produced. The method has been tested with different thresholds and evaluated with case studies. Requiring isallobaric ageostrophic winds of at least 7 m s −1 in five grid boxes suggests that HSs primarily occur and last longest during spring. Their occurrence frequency and duration in winter and summer are consistent with the statistics of upper level troughs, which are their synoptic-scale driver.HSs have been associated with 30–50% of the monthly total emissions in spring spatially averaged and up to 80% regionally. This is the time of year with the largest emission over northern Africa, pointing to the strong impact of HSs on dust emission. Compared to the long-term average of HS emissions, March 2004 is unusual and substantially contributes to the overall largest anomaly in annual total emission. Summer shows the least emissions associated with HSs in agreement with their less frequent occurrence and shorter duration.The large dust emission associated with HSs in winter and spring underlines the importance of an accurate representation of synoptic-scale storms for emission simulations. State-of-the-art models from CMIP5 disagree on dust emission as well as the track density and strength of cyclones, raising concern for the credibility of future changes in such storms with implications going beyond dust aerosol. Comparing atmosphere only and coupled simulations suggests that differences in Mediterranean cyclones are caused by the atmospheric model component and linked to a bias in blocking frequency. show a good performance of ECHAM5 for near-surface winds in cyclones north of 25°N compared to ERA-Interim and observations but a decline of the model performance with coarser resolution. The strongest winds in these storms occur in the cool sector, similar to the much larger HSs over North Africa. In order to evaluate and possibly improve the key processes for dust-emitting winds from HSs in CMIP6 models, the storm dynamic of HSs needs to be better understood. Flow interaction with the Atlas Mountains helped in generating dust-emitting winds during the HS in March 2004, but several open questions remain. Unbalanced processes probably play an important role in the development of HSs and will be further analyzed in an accompanying study."
13,particles clouds,"Revisiting ice nucleation from precipitation samples. An emerging and unsolved question is the sensitivity of cloud processes, precipitation, and climate to the atmospheric ice nucleus spectrum. This work revisits estimation of atmospheric ice-nucleating particle concentration derived from cloud water and precipitation samples representing a wide range of geographical locations, seasons, storm systems, precipitation types, instruments, concentrations, and temperatures. Concentrations of ice-nucleating particles are shown to vary over 10 orders of magnitude. High variability is observed in the -5 degrees C to -12 degrees C range which is suggested to be biologically derived nuclei whose life cycle is associated with intermittent source and efficient sink processes. The highest ever observed nucleus concentrations at -8 degrees C are 3 orders of magnitude lower than observed ice crystal concentrations in tropical cumuli at the same temperature. The observed upper and lower limits of the nucleus spectrum provide a possible constraint on minimum enhancement factors for secondary ice formation processes. Aerosol emissions from both anthropogenic and biological sources have been implicated in modifying clouds and precipitation. Precipitation forms when cloud droplets aggregate together, a point that defines the cloud as being colloidally unstable. Instability arises when hydrometeors begin to collide and coalesce. This process is only efficient when cloud hydrometeors exceed a certain size threshold and two droplets of dissimilar size are in proximity. Although there are multiple mechanisms that can lead to colloidal instability in atmospheric clouds, the generally adopted view is that of the most frequent pathway over the midlatitude oceans and continents. The Bergeron process posits that some small fraction of particles nucleate ice crystals, and these then grow rapidly via vapor deposition, redistributing some of the cloud condensed water content over few ice crystals. These seed ice crystals then collect supercooled drops through collision with other ice particles, resulting in graupel, snow, or rain if temperatures permit melting.Cloud droplets nucleate on atmospheric particles. Only a small fraction of these are also ice-nucleating particles INPs . Pollution and intermittent biological emissions may increase absolute concentrations of INP or modify the ratio between INP and cloud droplets. However, the spatial scale at which these emissions are important is not fully understood. While the recent resurgence in ice nucleation research has provided a continuously growing database on ice nucleation efficiencies for different aerosol types and informed the continuing refinement of INP parameterizations, quantifying and understanding cloud-ice microphysical processes remains difficult in field studies. Complications arise on the cloud system scale from the invigoration of convection due to latent heat release from freezing processes, which can lead to deeper clouds and more precipitation in the presence of ice formation in the lower parts of the cloud. Because of this complexity, causal chains between increases in INP number and cloud field evolution or glaciation indirect effects on climate must be inferred from simulations using scaled INP parameterizations. To obtain meaningful constraints over what range the nucleus concentrations may vary, we suggest that the limits of the complete atmospheric nucleus spectrum, defined as the cumulative number of INP active at temperature T , are needed.This work revisits the several decade old idea that measurements of nuclei suspended in precipitation can be used to estimate the limits of the atmospheric nucleus spectrum. We present new measurements of INP concentration in snow, sleet, and rainwater samples. Combining these data with a large number of similar measurements from the literature produces a composite nucleus spectrum. We propose that these data provide a constraint for INP concentrations in precipitating clouds between −5°C and −38°C.For the new data presented, snowfall or rainwater was collected by placing glass dishes on an elevated platform on the roof of a five-story building that is located ~3 km west of the city center of Raleigh, NC, USA. The rooftop is several meters above the canopy height. Prior to collection, the dishes were cleaned with concentrated H 2 SO 4 , isopropanol, ultrapure water, baked at 180°C, and covered with aluminum foil until precipitation approached. After some amount was accumulated, the collected sample was transferred to clean glass bottles and refrigerated at 4°C until the drop freeze assay measurement commenced. Samples were collected between July 2012 and October 2013 and include the following. Year 2012: convective storm July 4 , light rain following a frontal passage July 10/11 , heavy rain from a downpour July 20 , heavy rain from a squall line that produced lightning July 28 , a mix of light and heavy rain August 19 , intermittent showers from a frontal passage September 3 , moist air from the Gulf of Mexico mixing with a cold front September 18 , drizzle following overnight intermittent rain October 1 , a cold frontal passage November 13 , and light rain November 14 . Year 2013: a mix of rain, snow, and sleet produced by winter storm systems January 17 and 25 , scattered showers July 3 and 10 , frontal passage August 10 , and remnants of tropical storm Karen October 7 . A total of 38 rain spectra were measured. Time between collection and measurement was 0 day n  = 9 , 1 day n  = 5 , 2 days n  = 13 , 3 days n  = 2 , 4 days n  = 4 , 5, 6, 17, 18, 20, 30, and 35 days n  = 1 each . Further details and data of individual rain spectra are provided in the supporting information .Nucleus concentrations were measured by drop-freezing assay using the NC State Cold-Stage NC State CS instrument. This instrument has demonstrated good agreement with other drop-freezing assay setups for illite NX samples and ambient aerosol collected with impinger samples unpublished data . The typical difference between different cold-stage measurements for the same sample is approximately 1 order of magnitude in active site density INP concentration or ~ ±2°C in temperature. In the NC State CS drops are emulsified in squalene to prevent dendritic ice growth from inducing freezing in neighboring drops. Prepared emulsions contained drops having either population mean volume of 357 ± 20 pL or 165 ± 18 nL small and larger drops, respectively . The emulsion is placed on a hydrophobically coated glass slide and cooled at 1 K min -1 . The average number of drops was 157 ± 107 and 62 ± 12 drops for the pL and nL experiments, respectively. Freeze events are detected using time lapse microscopy. The temperature, where 50% of a rainwater sample is frozen, shifts by +1.5°C when varying the cooling rate from 0.01 to 10 K min −1 . The fraction unfrozen is used to derive INP concentration. It is assumed that the squalene does not interfere with the INP measurement. Direct intercomparison of ambient aerosol samples collected with an impinger sampler between the NC State CS using oil immersion and the CSU ice spectrometer without oil immersion support that assumption unpublished data .A total of 62 spectra were collected from the literature. Nucleus spectra were either taken from previous publications of our group, transcribed from tables, or digitized from graphs. Differential nucleus spectra from Vali were converted to cumulative nucleus spectra, defined as cumulative number of INP active at temperature T . The data include three rain samples from Raleigh from April 2013 collected during the peak of pollen season, two rain samples from a frontal passage case study, 2 August 2013, 12 cloud water samples collected at Puy de Dôme, France, June 2011 to October 2012, a snow sample collected where it had accumulated the night before in a powdery layer on top of an older frozen snow layer in the Jura mountains, Switzerland, January 2013, 13 snow and 1 hail sample collected in Laramie, WY, and the neighboring mountain range between June 2010 and April 2012, spectra for snow samples collected from various locations in France, Montana, Yukon, and Antarctica, October 2005 to June 2006, and rain samples from Louisiana July–October 2007, spectra characteristic of hail from Alberta and the Montreal region prior to 1966, and selected spectra from Figures 1–3 and 6 corresponding to rain and hail from summer storms in Alberta, 1968. The use of drop freeze assays in these works is common. However, the implementation is unique to each investigator and the main difference is the drop volume used in the experiments 400 pL–1 mL . Samples described in Christner et al . were also preconcentrated before analysis.Figure  1 shows the nucleus spectrum, including samples from all seasons and a broad range of meteorological conditions collected around the globe between 1966 and 2014. An INP spectrum consists of the concentration of INP that was active at a given supercooled temperature per liter of collected water inside ordinate axis . The INP concentration in collected water can be expressed as INP concentration within the cloud outside ordinate axis under assumptions defined in section 4.5 . Each measurement line total of 100 corresponds to a single cumulative spectrum measured by drop-freezing assay. The concentration range for individual spectra is determined by the drop volume and the number of drops investigated 400 nL to 1 mL . Drop volume and lowest unfrozen fraction, i.e., 1 in n drops freezing, determines the lowest concentration resolved by a single experiment. Typical ranges for a single spectrum are 1 to 3 orders of magnitude in nucleus concentration. Overall nucleus concentration ranges between 1 L −1 water at −5°C and 10 10  L −1 water at −38°C. No INP active at temperatures warmer than −4°C were observed. Nucleus concentration varies at approximately 5 orders of magnitude in the range −8°C to −10°C and 1 to 3 orders of magnitude at temperatures colder than −15°C. Spectra-to-spectra variability within a set of measurements from the same investigator is similar to variability between spectra measured by different investigators in the overlap regions. For example, the measurements contributed by our group using nL drops group of spectra at ~10 6  L −1 water span the same temperature range as those reported by Vali . Similarly, the measurements by Vali circumscribe those by Christner et al ., Hill et al ., Stopelli et al ., Joly et al ., and coworkers. The nuclei shown at temperatures warmer than −10°C are sensitive to heat or chemical treatment and are thought to originate from biological sources. The large variability in the observed concentration is likely due to intermittent sources and preferential scavenging of the most effective nuclei by storms. The grey envelope approximates upper and lower bounds of the revealed nucleus spectrum. Generation of the shaded region and numerical values for the upper and lower bounds for incorporation into model sensitivity studies are provided in the SI.Composite nucleus spectrum obtained from cloud water, rain water, and melted sleet, snow, and hail samples at different sampling locations indicated. Each line corresponds to a single spectrum measured by drop-freezing assay. Colors differentiate citation sources. Brown lines indicate spectra where time between sampling and measurement exceeded 5 days. Dashed lines correspond to melted hail. The grey shaded area denotes the envelope of observations. The secondary axis represents the spectrum per volume of air assuming condensed water content of 0.4 g m −3 .In the absence of sample contamination the origin of freezing nuclei is from the transfer of particles to the hydrometeors in the atmosphere. The question is whether the transfer mechanisms are sufficiently constrained to permit useful quantitative deductions about the atmospheric nucleus spectrum from the precipitation samples. Here we revisit the debate between Rosinski et al ., and Vali about the viability of the hypothesis that measuring the INP spectrum of rainwater can be used to constrain INP per volume of air active in precipitating clouds.Köhler measured the salt concentration in cloud and rain water from a marine aerosol sample and found similar concentrations. Since cloud droplets and rain droplets have vastly different sizes ~10 µm and ~1 mm respectively , his measurements unequivocally established that the conversion from cloud to rain drops occurs by coalescing ~10 6 cloud droplets into a single hydrometeor. During the early stages of cloud formation, the droplet size distribution narrows and quickly grows to diameters 8–30 µm via water vapor diffusion. To initiate colloidal instability via collision and coalescence, the presence of a few large collector particles, having faster settling velocities than the generic cloud droplet pool is needed. These large particles can be ice crystals grown by vapor deposition, as assumed in the Bergeron process. Ice crystals form through heterogeneous nucleation of the ice phase inside cloud droplets condensation/immersion mode or by ice formation on the interstitial aerosol deposition or contact mode . Because the collector particle forms, by definition, the seed of the precipitation, each hydrometeor maintains some memory of its inception. At the core of this argument is that INP activity remains unaltered by the freezing process and subsequent storage for some time. This idea is supported by measurements generally better than 1°C repeatability of median population freezing temperatures for droplets that undergo repeated freeze/thaw cycles for up to 1 week of time, including samples from rainwater.Traversing the column toward the ground, the raindrop may sweep out additional INPs via aerodynamic capture, Brownian motion, diffusiophoresis, thermophoresis, and electrostatic forces. At temperatures warmer than −10°C, rimed ice crystals can splinter leading to secondary ice formation. Gases including SO 2 , HNO 3 , or volatile organic compounds may partition to hydrometeors via adsorption or absorption. Subsequent reactions can increase solute concentration or alter the pH, which may change the ice nucleus spectrum of the sample. Suspended large soil particles or pollen grains are suspected to shed small particles including ice-nucleating macromolecules and might contribute INPs to the nucleus spectrum of the collected samples. Aging of samples between collection and analysis causing nucleus concentration to change is a potential concern. To estimate INP per volume of air active in cloud, cloud condensed water content must be known. However, cloud condensed water content is usually unknown when sampling precipitation on the ground and must be assumed. Furthermore, evaporation of hydrometeors during transit will concentrate the nuclei relative to its original concentration in cloud water. In the following we address these concerns.The freezing temperature of drops containing INPs is reduced proportional to water activity. However, ionic species in precipitation are typically found at μM level, resulting in minimal deviation of water activity from unity where freezing point depression due to dissolved solutes is negligible. Attard et al . have shown that acidic pH, NO 2 , O 3 exposure, and UV-A exposure decreases the ice nucleating IN activity of Pseudomonas bacterial strains by less than 1 order in magnitude. Ozonolysis at 4 ppmv also reduces dust ice nucleation activity up to a factor of 4. Exposure of mineral dust surfaces to strong H 2 SO 2 or HNO 3 appears to have small or no effect on INP activity when the particle is diluted into a cloud drop for a few seconds inside a continuous flow diffusion chamber. Stopelli et al . studied aging of the IN activity in snow water during storage at 4°C blue spectrum in Figure  1 and noticed concentration to decrease from 0.0278 L −1 to 0.013 L −1 water −10°C between day 0 and day 30. The spectra where the delay between sampling and analysis was 5 days or more brown lines in Figure  1 fall within the observed range of variability. Organic monolayer coatings on cloud droplets may trigger ice nucleation, including surfactant alcohols and fatty acids. Studies of the ice-nucleating ability of secondary organic aerosol systems that produce a mix of compounds that are similar in structure to the ice-nucleating alcohols and fatty acids have not been able to demonstrate the effect for complex organic mixtures. The extent to which complex organic aerosol in the atmosphere can initiate ice via this pathway is unclear since the required organization of hydrophilic groups in ice-nucleating clusters is likely hindered by the heterogeneity of the organic mixture. However, if present in the rainwater samples, the oil interface employed in this study would unlikely capture freezing by this mechanism. Considering only these studies, dissolved solutes and chemical aging are likely to contribute less than 1 order of magnitude uncertainty in nucleus concentration at a selected temperature.The contribution of INP to rainwater from sweep out capture of aerosol by settling raindrops depends in principle on the three-dimensional fields of rain, INP size and number concentration, the collection efficiency, and the height from which the drop falls. Wright et al . used the Slinn collection kernel to estimate that the contribution of INP from sweep out was between 1.2 and 14% of the observed INP concentration in one of the rainwater samples light blue spectra in Figure  1 . Vali compared pairs of near-simultaneous samples at cloud base and ground level. The spectral shapes were similar in the two cases. Samples near cloud base tended to have more nuclei. He argued that the fortuitous cancelation of loss of INPs during descent and gain of INPs due to aerosol capture and ice nucleus multiplication would seem unlikely. The cloud water spectra from Joly et al . are also similar in range to other rainwater samples and also tendentially have higher concentrations Figure  1 , which supports Vali's original argument that there is no general strong bias in measured INP due to sweep out. The rain spectrum of Hader et al . green line in Figure  1 was obtained at the peak of the pollen season when pollen grain is rupturing and subsequent release of IN active macromolecules might have tainted the rain spectrum. Yet strong enhancement of INP is not seen, despite the simultaneous occurrence of a pollen outbreak. The studies cited above suggest that aerosol collection and nucleus multiplication may not lead to a large bias in derived INP concentrations. Quantification of this uncertainty will be needed in future studies.Cloud level INP values can be estimated based on the notion that the precipitation was formed by the collection of cloud drops. Conversion of INP per unit liquid to INP per unit air is achieved by assuming that the precipitation sample is dispersed into pL droplets corresponding to 10–20 µm in diameter in a volume of air that has a cloud condensed water content CWC . Figure  1 includes an axis that assumes CWC = 0.4 g m −3 to estimate the INP concentration per unit volume of air at cloud level. Under the assumption that each liter of condensed water yields 10 12 uniformly sized pL cloud drops, ~1:10 12 and ~1:10 2 drops will have a nucleus at −5°C and −38°C, respectively. The Poisson probability that a single pL drop shares multiple ice-nucleating particles is negligible, permitting to establish correspondence between INP in liquid and INP in air. Typical ranges for CWC in thicker clouds are between 0.2 and 0.8 g m −3 . Therefore, the uncertainty in INP due to that conversion is approximately a factor of 2. INP concentrations of approximately 1 L −1 of air at −20°C derived from the liquid spectra are consistent with old and new summaries of direct INP measurements.Note that the concentration conversion from liquid to air is only valid for cases when the precipitation evaporation rate was small enough to not lead to appreciable preconcentration of INP in the sample. For an assumed water vapor deficit of 0.2 relative humidity 80% and rainwater content of 0.1 g m −3 the time until 50% of the rain is evaporated is ~550 s, based on a parameterization for rain evaporation. At a fall speed of ~5 m/s, this corresponds to a distance ~2.7 km between cloud base and ground. Evaporation is likely not a large source of bias for strong convective storms, persistent rain events at high relative humidity, and sampling near cloud base. Precipitation collected in dry climates and systems with high cloud base may need to apply corrections based on observed vertical vapor deficit profiles. None of the spectra in Figure  1 were corrected for this effect.With the aforementioned caveats in mind, the remaining question is as follows: Can the composite nucleus spectrum provide insights into the role of INPs in cloud glaciation and rain initiation processes? Fletcher suggested that rain will be induced in cumuli when ice crystal concentrations exceed 1–10 L −1 air. For comparison, raindrop number concentrations range between 0.3 and 3 L −1 air. Simultaneous observations of cloud top temperature and surface precipitation shows that precipitation formation is efficient and frequent between −10°C and −20°C. Following the perhaps naïve model that each raindrop is seeded by an INP and taking a minimum nucleus concentration of 0.3 L −1 air that is required to initiate the raindrops assuming no secondary processes are at play , one would conclude from Figure  1 that sufficient nuclei available to exceed this threshold are never available at temperatures warmer than −10.5°C, sometimes available between −10.5°C and −23°C, and always available at temperatures colder than −23°C.Figure  1 also reveals that at −10°C the observed upper limit of INP concentration is 5.7 · 10 5  L −1 water or 0.1 L −1 air. In many of the observed cases, fewer than 0.001 L -1 air of INP are present. In contrast, some observations note ice crystal concentrations exceeding 100 L −1 air in tropical summer marine or wintertime continental cumuli and cloud tops not exceeding −8°C to -10°C under conditions that exclude ice nucleation at conditions colder than those reported. Secondary ice formation processes such as the Hallett-Mossop process or splintering upon freezing were invoked to explain these observations. The insight that primary ice formation is insufficient to explain ice crystals in clouds is not new. Reports of very high ice concentrations in the 1960s suggested that there is a discrepancy between INP and ice crystal concentration. Acknowledgment of shattering artifacts in airborne cloud droplet probes challenged the validity of these findings. Subsequently, modified tip designs produced successful INP-ice crystal closure has been reported in orographic wave clouds at −20°C to −30°C. Yet the recent studies by Lawson et al . and Crawford et al . indicate that the INP-ice crystal discrepancy persists at warmer temperatures even with improved cloud droplet probes.An important point is that nuclei are still needed to initiate first ice. Are low nucleus concentrations 0.0001 L −1 air at −8°C sufficient to kick start secondary ice formation and explain ice crystal concentrations of 100 L −1 air? Or alternatively, can previously identified mechanisms of ice crystal enhancement explain the over 5 orders of magnitude differences in concentrations? To date no evidence of such a mechanism has been produced. To what level cloud fields are starved for INPs remains an unanswered question. Additional field experiments, theoretical studies, and modeling will be needed to determine the critical number of INP to which cloud microphysical processes may respond. The nucleus spectra presented here may guide such attempts.Finally, the demonstrated extreme rarity of INP at temperatures warmer than −10°C, in the lower limit corresponding to approximately 1 in 10 12 of the total atmospheric particle pool makes the deployment of online instrumentation for this temperature impractical for the foreseeable future. The necessary selectivity and sampling volumes are simply prohibitive. High-flow filter sampling and/or precipitation collection combined with drop-freezing assays are likely to remain the primary means of investigating these nuclei. Most of the caveats with precipitation sampling are feared to bias concentrations so they appear higher e.g., aerosol capture, shedding of satellite particles, and evaporation during transit . Resolving the change in the physical and chemical nature of ice-nucleating particles between the time the cloud drop freezes and the laboratory measurement occurs is not possible with this technique. Furthermore, the majority of measurements have been obtained over continents and within the boundary layer, which implies close proximity to biological sources. We therefore believe that the upper limit of the INP spectrum is unlikely to be significantly exceeded by future measurements. In contrast, the lower limit of the nucleus spectrum will probably be revised by future studies. Precipitation samples collected over the remote oceans or cloud water samples collected in remote free troposphere may reveal regions that are even more starved for nuclei than the cases presented here.A composite nucleus spectrum for heterogeneous freezing in the immersion mode was derived from individual precipitation and cloud water samples that were collected over wide range of geographical locations, seasons, storm systems, precipitation types, and concentrations. The samples were analyzed with a variety of instruments capturing different freezing temperature ranges. Uncertainties in deriving INP concentrations from these samples were estimated from a suite of literature studies and arise from instrumentation, chemical attack, sample aging, efficiency of capturing INPs during sweep out and/or nucleus multiplication, and conversion from liquid to air concentration. First-order estimates for these effects are available in section 4 . However, precise quantification of these uncertainties will require further investigation. All spectra, with the exception of the spectra from Joly et al ., were derived from precipitation and thus the presented composite spectrum may represent only the concentration of ice-forming particles in precipitating clouds.The sharp decrease in the concentration with increasing temperature suggests that no INPs active at temperatures warmer than −5°C are present at levels exceeding 10 −7 L −1 of air in the atmosphere. Variability in nucleus concentration spans over 5 orders of magnitude in the −5°C to −10°C range, 1 order of magnitude at −25°C, and 2 to 3 orders of magnitude elsewhere. The high variability of the biological INPs present at the warm end of the spectrum identified via heat treatment in the original studies is indicative of intermittent source and/or efficient sink processes for the most active INPs in the atmosphere. Even the highest ever observed INP concentrations at −8°C are 3 orders of magnitude lower than ice crystal concentrations in some tropical cumuli, providing a possible constraint on minimum enhancement factors for secondary ice formation processes. The parameterized upper and lower bounds of the spectrum can be used to initialize model predictions that evaluate the sensitivity of cloud microphysics, precipitation, and climate forcing due to variations in the INP pool."
14,dust atmosphere,"A solar escalator on Mars: Self-lifting of dust layers by radiative heating. Dust layers detected in the atmosphere of Mars by the light detection and ranging LIDAR instrument on the Phoenix Mars mission are explained using an atmospheric general circulation model. The layers were traced back to observed dust storm activity near the edge of the north polar ice cap where simulated surface winds exceeded the threshold for dust lifting by saltation. Heating of the atmospheric dust by solar radiation caused buoyant instability and mixing across the top of the planetary boundary layer PBL . Differential advection by wind shear created detached dust layers above the PBL that ascended due to radiative heating and arrived at the Phoenix site at heights corresponding to the LIDAR observations. The self-lifting of the dust layers is similar to the solar escalator mechanism for aerosol layers in the Earth's stratosphere. Laser remote sensing measurements of the vertical distribution of dust in the atmosphere of Mars above the landing site of the NASA Phoenix mission were nearly identical to similar measurements above the Australian desert within the planetary boundary layer PBL . The PBL depth was about 4 km in each case. The similarity does not extend to heights above the top of the PBL, where dust is a dominant constituent in the atmosphere of Mars but not on Earth. On Mars the dust content is reduced above the PBL but continues to be approximately well mixed and proportional to atmospheric pressure up to heights above 20 km. The mechanisms for transporting dust from the surface to heights above the PBL on Mars are the subject of this report.For the atmosphere of the Earth, it has been shown that radiative heating will result in self-lifting of layers containing particulate material, such that the aerosol plays an active role in its vertical transport. This has been observed in the stratosphere and referred to as a “solar escalator” since vertical steps in dust layers correspond to the diurnal cycle in solar radiative heating. The radiative heating of dust has also been recognized as being potentially more significant in the atmosphere of Mars since the molecular density there is a factor of 100 less than on Earth. In this study a general circulation model of the atmosphere on Mars was used to explain the observation of dust layers that were decoupled from the PBL. It was found that the radiative self-lifting process was playing a substantial role in the vertical transport and that the solar escalator analogy is also applicable on Mars.The LIDAR instrument on the NASA Phoenix Mars mission provided vertical profile measurements of atmospheric dust and water ice clouds above the northern high-latitude landing site 68.2°N, 125.7°W over a period from late spring to late summer aerocentric longitudes, L s , of 76.6° to 151° . The optical extinction coefficient was derived from the LIDAR measurements, and this was used as an indicator of the amount of dust loading. Around summer solstice L s  = 90° the measured optical extinction coefficient was enhanced within the well-mixed PBL. There were also distinct layers of material observed at and above the top of the PBL heights 4–7 km around summer solstice. In the present paper we focus on two cases with a layer at height 4 km Figure  1 .Vertical profiles of optical extinction coefficient at wavelength 532 nm derived from the Phoenix LIDAR measurements solid black lines showing separated dust layers peaking at height 4 km on mission sols a 20 L s  = 85.6° and b 30 L s  = 90° . The measurement uncertainty was ±0.005 km −1 at a height of 4 km and increased gradually with height to ±0.007 km −1 at a height of 10 km. The vertical profile of optical extinction coefficient from the model simulation is shown above the Phoenix site at L s  = 91.8 red . The blue lines are the simulated extinction coefficient profiles selected along a back trajectory starting at L s  = 91.8 at height 5 km over the Phoenix site, for L s  = 90° in Figure  1 a and 89° in Figure  1 b. The back trajectory and the positions of these profiles are indicated in Figures  3 and 4 . Full lines represent total extinction and dashed lines the portion due to wind lifting.These layers are considered to be dust rather than water ice clouds since they were observed during the warmest part of the day afternoon as well as at night. Later in the summer the LIDAR detected clouds at the PBL top but only in the early morning hours when the temperature would drop below the water frost point of about –62° C. This was confirmed with simulations. Clouds could not form at height 4 km during the afternoon at summer solstice unless the amount of water vapor in the PBL was much greater than the amount measured at the surface on the Phoenix lander. Also, there was no ground ice fog observed around summer solstice when the surface temperatures at night where much lower than at the top of the PBL. Ground ice fog was observed by the LIDAR only later in the summer, 40 Martian solar days sols after solstice. Until now there has been no explanation for the layers at the top of the PBL at summer solstice.A general circulation model for the atmosphere of Mars was developed and applied here for interpreting measurements of dust from the NASA Phoenix mission. It was based on the Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale GEM model for weather forecasting on Earth. The model was operated on a grid with a horizontal resolution of 4° × 4° and with 102 hybrid vertical levels reaching from the surface to ~150 km. The vertical resolution was 35 m near the surface and increased gradually to ~1.2 km at height 10 km. At the latitude of the Phoenix landing site, the PBL was resolved with 17 vertical layers. The integration timestep was 1/48 of a sol.Processes added to the model for the present study include dust with radiative transfer using the refractive index of Wolff et al . as in Madeleine et al ., carbon dioxide with surface exchange, a multilayered thermal soil model, turbulent transport in the atmospheric surface layer based on Monin-Obhukov similarity theory, convective transport inside the PBL following Holtslag and Boville without the countergradient term , and the effects of topography with a low level blocking scheme including gravity wave drag. The geophysical boundary conditions include topography, albedo, thermal inertia, and roughness length. The recommendations of Haberle et al . for polar cap emissivity and albedo were followed. The depth of the subsurface ice table was set in accordance with Mellon et al ..Dust lifting processes were implemented in the model following Kahre et al .. The dust particle size distribution was represented with three size bins 0.1, 1.5, and 10 µm . Dust was lifted from the surface by saltation following the “Kahre-Murphy-Haberle KMH ” method when the surface wind stress exceeded a threshold value of 0.0225 Pa. A detailed roughness length map was applied, and the mean value of roughness length inside every grid cell was used. The efficiency factor for wind lifting was set to 0.15. The dust mass flux from small-scale vortices dust devils, Kok et al . was proportional to the surface turbulent heat flux and the height of the PBL. The efficiency factor for the dust devil mass flux was set to 6 × 10 −9  kg/J. Sedimentation of the dust particles was taken into account using the Stokes settling velocity with Cunningham slip-flow correction. These settings allowed the model to reproduce the latitude distribution of dust as observed by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer TES instrument on the NASA Mars Global Surveyor MGS mission at northern summer solstice Figure  2 a . a The latitudinal distribution of zonally averaged dust optical depths at 991 nm from the simulation, scaled to the 6.1 mbar pressure level and averaged over the period L s  = 89°–91° full red line . The dashed line represents the portion of the simulated dust due to wind lifting. The black data points are the optical depths measured from orbit by the TES instrument, scaled to 6.1 mbar, averaged zonally and over the period L s  = 89°–91° in Mars years 25 + and 26 x . The absorption optical depths from TES were transformed to extinction optical depths using a factor of 1.3 and scaled from 9.3 µm to visible wavelengths using a factor of 2. Only data with a surface temperature of 238 K or higher were retained in the plot in order to reduce uncertainties in the vicinity of the polar ice caps. The vertical black dashed line indicates the latitude of the Phoenix Lander. b Time series of the total daytime optical depth measured by the Phoenix SSI instrument at wavelength 991 nm black compared with the simulation result at the Phoenix site red full line . Also indicated is the portion of the simulated dust optical depth that originated from the wind lifting near the polar cap red dashed line . The error bars represent the range in optical depth measurements by TES in Mars years 25 and 26 within 2° longitude and 2° latitude of the Phoenix site. The TES data have been scaled to visible extinction optical depths as in Figure  1 a.At high northern latitudes the large optical depths measured by TES from orbit Figure  2 a and by the Surface Stereo Imager SSI instrument on Phoenix Figure  2 b could only be reproduced by including wind gusting at latitudes north of 60°N. Also, the dust devil efficiency factor had to be increased to 3.0 × 10 −8  kg/J at these latitudes. A subgrid-scale treatment of the roughness map was also implemented north of 60°N latitude but did not lead to a significant increase in dust optical depths. Wind gusting was incorporated in the model using a Weibull distribution see, e.g., Newman et al . , assuming that the model winds are the averaged values of the distribution. The resulting dust mass flux was then computed as in Newman et al .. A Weibull shape factor of unity resulted in a dust optical depth that was in agreement with the measurements Figure  2 . The different settings for dust lifting at latitudes north of 60°N reflect the fact that dust lifting parameters that lead to a simulation that matches the dust loading at low latitudes do not produce sufficient dustiness at high northern latitudes. This could be explained by the presence of a strong dust source such as the extended dune fields in the north polar region and the sublimation lag from the evaporating seasonal polar ice cap. Another factor is that the model's resolution may not sufficiently allow for a detailed enough prescription of the permanent polar cap and related high friction velocities over ice-soil boundaries.Where heating of airborne dust by absorption of solar radiation created regions of convective instability in the model, the temperature, momentum, and constituents including dust were vertically mixed over the unstable model levels in order to regain stability. Inside the PBL the implemented convective diffusion parameterization provided the required mixing. Above the PBL, the vertical mixing was simulated with a parameterization of eddy diffusion, in which the eddy diffusion coefficients were calculated using a mixing length and a stability function based on the gradient flux Richardson number. The form of the stability function was chosen as in Haberle et al ., and the mixing length was set to 500 m.The model simulations were validated by comparing with various data sets. The annual cycle of CO 2 ice mass in the polar caps in the simulation was in agreement with the observations by the gamma ray spectrometer on the NASA Mars Odyssey mission. The latitudinal distribution of dust optical depth around solstice was in agreement with measurements from TES Figure  2 a . The simulated surface atmospheric pressure cycle was in agreement with the measurements on the NASA Viking Lander 1 and the NASA Phoenix missions. The diurnal range in the simulated temperature at a height of 2 m at the Phoenix lander site was in agreement with measurements on the Phoenix Lander. The simulated PBL depth was in agreement with the Phoenix LIDAR measurements.The model simulation of the vertical profile of the optical extinction coefficient of dust was verified by comparison with measurements from the Mars Climate Sounder MCS instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter MRO mission at the time of the Phoenix mission and with measurements from the LIDAR instrument on the Phoenix Lander. Some selected cases are shown in Figures  S1 a, S1 b, and S1 c in the supporting information . The optical extinction coefficient was retrieved from MCS measurements at wavelength 21 µm and then scaled using a multiplicative factor of 7.3 in order to compare at the wavelength of 532 nm used by the Phoenix LIDAR. When there was overlap in the height of the measurements, the LIDAR and MCS dust extinction coefficient profiles matched within the measurement uncertainty. The simulated vertical profiles of dust optical extinction coefficient were found to be within the range of variability and measurement uncertainty in the observations Figures  S1 a, S1 b, and S1 c . The simulated vertical profile of temperature was also compared with measurements from MCS above the Phoenix site at the time of the mission. The simulations and measurements were in agreement within natural variability, and one example is provided in the supporting information Figure  S1 d .The simulations were also in agreement with the variation in the total atmospheric optical depth as observed by the SSI instrument on the Phoenix lander over the period around summer solstice when the dust loading was a maximum Figure  2 b . A peak in optical depth just after summer solstice in the simulation was due to transport of dust that was originally lifted by saltation at the edge of the polar ice cap and then transported to the Phoenix site Figure  3 a . This was found to be an annually repeating phenomenon when the model was run for several Mars years since the timing was linked to the retreat of the seasonal CO 2 ice cap to within the north polar sand sea the dark albedo area surrounding the polar cap in Figure  3 b . At this point the albedo contrast between the cap and surrounding soil was maximal, leading to sharp thermal gradients, causing strong near-surface winds, and dust lifting by saltation. The area of dust lifting in the simulation roughly coincided with a large dust cloud observed from orbit by the Mars Color Imager MARCI instrument on the NASA MRO mission Figure  3 b that started at L s ~85° at the edge of the cap at longitude ~90°W. A sequence of MARCI images shows that dust was arising from this event and was spreading out toward southern latitudes and in the eastern direction Movie S1 . The simulation shows a similar evolution Movie S2 . a Map of simulated dust optical depth at wavelength 991 nm at L s =85°.

The locations of the extinction profiles plotted in blue in Figure  1 are indicated by squares. b Mosaic image from MARCI images on June 20, 2008 L s =88 °, with a dust cloud visible at longitudes 30°-120°W. The simulated back trajectory from Phoenix is overlaid and passes through this observed dust cloud.The model wind fields were used to calculate a back trajectory from a detached layer that was simulated above the PBL at the Phoenix site around solstice Figure  1 . Going back 12 to 16 sols, the air passed through a region of enhanced dust abundance originating from strong wind-lifting events close to the polar cap Figure  3 a . By a combination of radiative heating, mixing due to convective instability, and resolved atmospheric circulation advection , the lifted dust had spread out to latitudes around 75°N where the back trajectory from Phoenix passed.A crucial aspect of the simulations was heating of the dust by absorption of solar radiation. At the high latitudes of the polar cap edge the PBL is relatively shallow, and any dust that gets lifted there would mix only up to a few 100 m by the surface layer turbulent mixing. The atmospheric dust was heated by solar radiation which, averaged over a day, was stronger than the IR radiative cooling. This drove two mechanisms for vertical transport. The first was that the temperature response of the atmosphere caused convective instability that triggered turbulent mixing in the model and transport of dust to heights above the PBL. The other mechanism of vertical transport was self-lifting of dust layers due to solar heating.An explanation for the separated layers of dust observed by the Phoenix LIDAR is provided by plotting the contour of the vertical profile of dust optical extinction coefficient along the back trajectory Figure  4 a . Moving forward in time from the left side of Figure  4 a , the dust was mixed above the PBL starting at L s  = 85°, when the trajectory passed over the ice-soil boundary and there was a marked enhancement in dust lifting. As the wind speed increased with height above the ground, the dust was first advected further downwind at greater heights. After L s  = 88.5° the differential advection by wind shear produced a separated dust layer with the trajectory at height 2.7 km. The trajectory continued to rise to height 5 km before it arrived above the Phoenix site at L s  = 91.8°. The gradual lifting of the dust layer after L s  = 88.5° was caused by the radiative heating of the dust, which is plotted along the back trajectory in Figure  4 b. The ascent of the trajectory caused by heating due to solar radiation during daytime exceeded the descent caused by cooling due to IR radiation at night. The diurnal cycle in radiative heating and cooling caused a step-like trajectory after L s  = 88.5° in Figure  4 . The radiative heating resulted in a vertical displacement of the dust layer to an altitude where the increased potential temperature matched that of the environment. In the time period between when the layer became detached from the PBL L s  ~ 88.5° and when the time when the layer passed over the Phoenix site L s  = 91.8° , the integrated heating along the trajectory was 45 K in terms of potential temperature red line in Figure  4 c . This was slightly greater than the change in potential temperature in the background atmosphere between heights of 2.7 and 5 km, corresponding to the vertical displacement of the layer black line in Figure  4 c . The difference was due to mixing. A significant factor was that the sunlight was incident for an entire sol solar day at the latitude of the dust layer during midsummer, and offset the IR radiative cooling at night. The mechanism for self-lifting by radiative heating and the resulting step-like trajectory is similar to what has been referred to as the “solar escalator” for aerosol layers in the stratosphere of the Earth. a Contour plot of the vertical profile of the simulated dust extinction coefficient at wavelength 532 nm along the back trajectory of Figure  3 . The right hand edge corresponds to the situation at Phoenix at L s  = 91.8°, i.e., the simulated profile plotted in red in Figure  1 . The full white line represents the height of the trajectory shown in Figure  3 . The dashed white line represents the height of the top of the simulated planetary boundary layer. The vertical black dashed lines indicate the times of the extinction profiles plotted in blue in Figure  1 . b Simulated net solar + IR dust heating rate along the back trajectory, in K/sol solar day . c The potential temperature of the parcel of air followed along the back trajectory black line and the integrated heating rate along the trajectory red .The vertical profile of dust extinction coefficient from the simulation at L s  = 91.8° is compared to the Phoenix LIDAR observations in Figure  1 red line . The model simulation results in a layer of enhanced dust at heights 4–5 km that corresponds to the observations. Going back along the back trajectory, the simulated extinction profiles shown in Figure  1 from L s  = 90° and 89° blue lines have even closer similarity to the measured profiles. The model reproduces the LIDAR measurements within the same latitude range.A general circulation model for the atmosphere of Mars has been applied to explain dust layers that were observed by the LIDAR instrument on the Phoenix mission. The present paper focuses on dust layers that were observed at 4 km height around solstice. In the simulation the dust was lifted from the surface near the edge of the polar cap where strong winds were driven by the thermal gradients associated with the albedo contrast between bare land and ice. Heating due to absorption of solar radiation caused mixing of the dust to heights above the PBL where differential advection by shear drew the dust out into a layer. Heating of the layer by absorption of solar radiation then caused it to ascend further into the troposphere above the PBL. A similar process has been observed to occur in the stratosphere of the Earth, and it has been called the solar escalator. This study provides evidence that the solar escalator mechanism can contribute to the sustenance of dust in the atmosphere of Mars at heights above the PBL."
15,dust atmosphere aerosol climate,"Dust-rainfall feedback in West African Sahel. Drought persistence in West African Sahel has often been explained as an effect of positive vegetation-atmosphere feedback associated with surface albedo or the partitioning of solar radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes. An often overlooked aspect of land-atmosphere coupling results from vegetation controls on dust emissions and the ability of mineral aerosols to suppress precipitation. Here we first consider the case of local endogenous dynamics within the Sahel, whereby enhanced dust emissions resulting from a decrease in vegetation partly suppress precipitation, thereby further reducing vegetation cover. We then account for teleconnections between Sahel precipitation and exogenous i.e., Saharan dust emissions due to an increase in Saharan wind speed in years of above average Sahel precipitation. We find that in both cases vegetation-climate dynamics may have two stable states, one with low precipitation and high concentration of atmospheric dust and the other with high precipitation and lower levels of atmospheric dust. The shift of arid landscapes to “desert-like conditions” has frequently been associated with relatively abrupt losses of vegetation and the emergence of a stable state of permanently unvegetated land. These shifts typically involve the existence of bistable dynamics induced by the action of positive feedback between the land surface and the atmosphere. Such feedback entail that the mean annual rainfall is an increasing function of vegetation density; thus, as plant cover is lost, precipitation decreases until a threshold is crossed below which the mean annual rainfall is not sufficient to allow for vegetation survival. Mechanisms often invoked to explain this behavior are typically associated with the impact of vegetation on the surface energy balance through its effect on albedo, the partitioning of the incoming solar radiation between sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the consequent effects on the stability of the atmospheric boundary layer. These processes are commonly investigated using climate models coupled with land surface schemes.An often overlooked aspect of land-atmosphere interactions that can be particularly important in dryland environments is the ability of vegetation to modulate dust emissions and the role played by dust aerosols on precipitation. Atmospheric dust can contribute to drought persistence through mechanisms of precipitation suppression involving both cloud microphysics and radiative transfer. In fact, absorption and reflection of solar radiation by dust direct effect and long-lived clouds as a result of rainfall suppression first aerosol indirect effect cause a cooling of the ground surface, which weakens convection and thus induces a reduction of precipitation. Moreover, high concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei as a result of high atmospheric dust concentrations may lead to the formation of too many competing cloud droplets that do not reach the size of raindrops known as the “second aerosol indirect effect” , thus further inhibiting precipitation. The second aerosol indirect effect has been documented in the case of desert dust, smoke from burning biomass, and urban pollution. These effects have been studied mostly at the event scale, although some authors have also evaluated the impact of dust on the rainfall regime at seasonal and interannual time scales. There are also secondary effects associated with the ability of rain events to remove dust from the air column, thereby preventing its interference with subsequent cloud processes. Such a flushing effect, however, appears to have only limited significance because the dust front is expected to be removed from where convection occurs. In fact, most dust uplift in the Sahel is associated with dust storms known as “haboobs”, in which the vast majority of the dust is advected ahead of the precipitation.Rosenfeld et al . suggested that the ability of atmospheric dust to suppress precipitation could contribute to a positive desertification feedback, whereby rainfall suppression by dust causes drought-induced plant mortality and enhanced dust emissions as a result of the reduced vegetation cover. Even though this hypothesis has been put forth more than a decade ago, the significance of this mechanism still remains to be evaluated. Can this dust-precipitation feedback lead to the emergence of alternative stable states in land-atmosphere dynamics? It is unclear whether dryland regions can be stable both in a state with enough rainfall and vegetation to limit dust emissions vegetated, dust-free state and in a state with limited vegetation cover and precipitation suppression by high levels of atmospheric dust unvegetated, dust-laden state .Here we develop a new mechanistic model to investigate these dynamics using field data and an existing model of vegetation-precipitation dynamics parameterized for the Sahel-Sahara region of Africa. We focus on Sahel because this region is frequently affected by high concentrations of airborne dust, due to both local emissions and the proximity to major dust sources on Earth e.g., the Bodélé Depression in Chad . The potential role of dust in the Sahel's persisting drought has recently been highlighted in a few studies. We show how land-atmosphere interactions associated with the effect of dust on precipitation may lead to the emergence of alternative stable states in climate dynamics and explain the persisting drought that affected this region between 1968 and the end of the century. Drought persistence in the Sahel has previously been related to other positive land-atmosphere feedback resulting from the effects of vegetation on surface albedo and/or evapotranspiration. Other authors have argued that large-scale anomalies in sea surface temperature SST could explain the persistence of the recent Sahel drought. Later findings, however, have shown that the SST forcing alone is unable to explain the end of this megadrought. Therefore, internal land-atmosphere feedback need to be invoked to explain interannual rainfall variability and drought persistence in this region. These feedback, however, seem to be more complex and involve interactions between climatic conditions in the Sahel and part of the Sahara region, under the action of external drivers. Changes in precipitation and vegetation cover, however, also affect dust emissions from Sahel and could contribute to positive land-atmosphere feedback in the region. This study suggests that the shift to a vegetated/“wet” state in the West African Sahel can result from dust-rainfall feedback associated with the effect of atmospheric dust on precipitation and the control of vegetation cover on dust emissions.Vegetation in the Sahel includes grasses, shrubs, and small thorny trees. For simplicity, here we do not consider these plant functional groups separately but refer to the total vegetation cover V , % , consistent with other studies. We model the dynamics of vegetation in the West African Sahel by accounting for feedback among vegetation, dust, and precipitation. Notice that the life cycle of dust from emission to deposition and its impact on rainfall have a duration of a few days, while vegetation responds to precipitation anomalies over time scales of a few growing seasons. For this reason in the model we do not resolve individual dust or rainfall events but we consider the total precipitation and the average dust concentration during the growing season. Following previous studies, changes in vegetation cover are modeled as a linear growth: where α is the vegetation growth coefficient and V C is the carrying capacity i.e., the maximum vegetation cover allowed by limiting resources . Water is the major limiting factor for vegetation establishment and growth in this region. Based on Brovkin et al ., we express V C as a function of average precipitation during the growing seasons P ¯ , mm : where P c mm is a threshold value of average precipitation during the growing seasons below which vegetation cover is zero and λ is a coefficient expressing the sensitivity of vegetation cover to P .The effect of the vegetation-dust feedback is accounted for by coupling equation 1 with atmospheric dust dynamics during the growing seasons, which in this region coincides with the rainy seasons. However, in the Sahel atmospheric dust is also contributed by sources located outside the savanna band most notably, the Saharan Bodélé Depression in Chad . These areas are too dry to be suitable for vegetation growth. Therefore, we also include the effects of external dust sources that do not depend on vegetation cover V in the Sahel Figure 1 . We express the dust mass balance in the atmospheric dust layer of thickness Z as where C s   g m − 3 is the dust concentration mass of dust per unit volume ; E l and E e are the local dust emission and net inflow of dust to the Sahel from exogenous sources mass per unit area per unit time , respectively; and D e is the sum of the dust deposition rate and export from the region mass per unit area per unit time . D e is assumed to be proportional to dust concentration in a dust layer of thickness Z : where C  =  ZC s and f is the kinetic parameter of the dust deposition rate. We take seasonal averages of equation 3 over the rainy season and express the dust mass balance as where Δ C is the difference in dust mass per unit area between the beginning and the end of the rainy season and T is the duration of the rainy season. Because dust remains airborne for a period of 2–7 days, the effect on the atmospheric dust balance of dust events occurring during the rainy season has a memory much shorter than T and therefore Δ C can be set equal to zero.Dust-precipitation-vegetation interactions acting a locally and b through teleconnections with Saharan dust sources.Vegetation cover strongly affects dust emission rate. Following other studies, the dependence of the seasonal rate of local dust emission Ē l on vegetation cover can be expressed as where E 0 g m − 2 is the maximum emission rate when the vegetation cover is smaller than a minimum value V min below which plants are too sparse to affect the wind-induced production and entrainment of dust in the atmosphere. As V increases above V min , dust emissions exponentially decrease, with r being a coefficient affecting the sensitivity of dust emission to vegetation cover. Dust emissions E et from exogenous sources in the Bodélé Depression 15°E–23°E, 15°N–20°N are independent of V and occur when the wind shear velocity u * , m s −1 exceeds a critical threshold value u *  t m s −1 in the dust-emitting region. A fraction q of these emissions contributes to a net flux of dust advected into the Sahel E e  =  qE et . Following other studies, E et is expressed at hourly time scales as where b is an empirical constant that expresses the sensitivity of E et to changes of u * . Using the formulation by Lettau and Lettau we estimate b  = 0.56 g s 2 /m 5 . The shear velocity u * depends on wind speed and surface roughness: where κ is the von Kármán constant 0.4 , u H is the wind speed at elevation H , and Z 0 is the roughness length. We calculate E et for the Bodélé Depression 15°E–23°E, 15°N–20°N using equations 7 and 8 with hourly wind speed values see Table 1 for the model parameters . Hourly estimates of E et are then averaged to determine the mean dust emission during the rainy season. To that end, we first downscale wind speed values at 10 m elevation u 10 , m s −1 from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications MERRA data set 1979–2012 from daily to hourly, calculate E et , and then calculate the average seasonal emission rate for the Bodélé Depression Ē et . For the downscaling we assumed that hourly wind speeds follow a Weibull distribution in which the dimensionless shape parameter, k , is taken to be 4 and the scale parameter, S , is taken to be S  =  u H /. The average seasonal net input of dust from exogenous sources into the Sahel Ē e is then expressed as a fraction q of E et : Brovkin et al .Brovkin et al .Bhattachan et al .Hui et al .Hui et al .Prigent et al .Warren et al .Evan et al .Hsu et al .As noted in the Introduction, dust can suppress rainfall due to direct and/or indirect effects. The effect of dust on rainfall climatology is in general difficult to quantify because any relationship between atmospheric dust loadings and precipitation could be attributed to enhanced dust emissions in wetter periods rather than rainfall suppression induced by atmospheric dust. Hui et al . related dust in upwind locations 1–3 day back trajectories to downwind rainfall and found an empirical relationship between atmospheric dust levels expressed in terms of Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer aerosol index AI and daily precipitation in major cities Dakar, Bobo-Dioulasso, and Niamey in the West African Sahel. This approach improved the assessment of the direction of the causal relationship because rainfall in the downwind location is more unlikely to affect dust emissions in the upwind location 1–3 days before. While we acknowledge that this relationship could result from the spatiotemporal autocorrelation of precipitation, we argue that the autocorrelation of precipitation could be at least partly due to the positive feedback investigated in this study. The strength of the dust-precipitation feedback is overall difficult to assess at year-to-decade time scales. Here we rely on the dust-rainfall correlation analysis by Hui et al . and express mean growing season precipitation as where β expresses the strength of the dust-precipitation feedback mm per unit change in the aerosol index AI and P 0 is the maximum seasonal precipitation in dust-free conditions. To relate mean growing season precipitation in equation 10 to dust mass per unit area C ¯ in equation 5 we express C ¯ as a function of aerosol optical thickness τ : where η is a parameter converting aerosol optical thickness to dust mass path g m − 2 ; see Table 1 . Following Hsu et al ., the aerosol optical thickness τ can be related to the aerosol index AI as where m and n are the coefficients Table 1 .To summarize, this modeling framework accounts for the dependence of vegetation on precipitation equation 2 , the control of vegetation on dust emissions equation 6 , and the effect of dust on precipitation equation 10 Figure 1 a .The dynamics can be more complex than those portrayed in Figure 1 a because a teleconnection exists between processes taking place in the Sahel and in the Saharan dust source areas. Part of the atmospheric dust load in the Sahel is emitted from sources in the Sahara and is subsequently advected southeastward. These external sources are accounted for by equations 7 - 9 . It has also been observed that positive precipitation anomalies in the Sahel are associated with an intensification of a low-level cyclonic circulation centered on the western Sahara, with southerly wind anomalies i.e., in the opposite direction with respect to the average flow and a consequent weakening of the near-surface winds over the Bodélé Depression and other adjacent dust sources in the Sahara. As a result, precipitation in the Sahel is negatively correlated to surface wind speeds over dust source regions in the Sahara. This teleconnection Figure 1 b, dashed arrow could have an important effect on the dynamics investigated in this study. In fact, should Saharan dust turn out to be the predominant contributor to mineral aerosols in the Sahel, the dust-precipitation feedback could act at a distance between Sahara and Sahel and bypass vegetation dynamics Figure 1 b .We note that while the Bodélé is not the only active dust source in the Sahara, it is the most active source region and is upwind of the Sahel with regards to the climatological trade flow . Interannual variability in wind speeds over the major Saharan source regions are highly correlated. Thus, to investigate the effect of Saharan dust emissions on vegetation-precipitation dynamics in the Sahel, we look at the relationship between seasonal dust emissions in the Bodélé in the growing season gs Ē et ; from equation 7 and the average seasonal wind speed at 10 m elevation during the rainy season ū 10 . Based on calculations using equations 7 and 8 with wind speed values from the MERRA reanalysis data set 1979–2012 and averaging to the seasonal scale, we find that such a dependency can be expressed by an exponential equation: where A  = 751.33 g m −2  gs −1 and B  = 1.73 s m −1 .We then analyze wind speed data from National Centers for Environmental Prediction U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project-II reanalysis, and precipitation data from Global Precipitation Climatology Project for the years 1979–2012, and find that ū 10 over the Bodélé Depression 15°E–23°E, 15°N–20°N is negatively related to averaged precipitation P ¯ during the rainy season over the Sahel 20°W–10°E, 10°N–20°N , consistent with other studies, such that where ε are the residuals of the regression. Equation 14 shows that the wind speed in the Bodélé Depression is related to precipitation in the Sahel. Both P ¯ and ū 10 are the outcome from the low-level cyclone which is driven by large-scale circulation; therefore, their mutual dependency depends on large-scale forcings external to the Sahara-Sahel system e.g., sea surface temperatures . The use of a deterministic relationship to relate these two variables would not account for the role of external drivers. The reanalysis data used to determine equation 10 , however, are inherently the result of a suite of processes including the larger-scale circulation. Thus, to account for the effect of other drivers, we do not model ū 10 as tightly dependent on P ¯ . Rather, we account for the residuals and model them as a noise term expressed as an uncorrelated random variable with the same distribution normal distribution as the residuals of the u ¯ 10 − P ¯ relationship. This noise term is used to account for the spread of the regression line likely resulting from the external forcing SST not accounted for in the regression analysis.Taking the temporal derivative of equation 5 equal to zero and combining equations 6 - 14 we can determine mean growing season precipitation P ¯ as a function of vegetation cover V and fraction q of total dust emissions from exogenous sources in the Bodélé Depression contributing to net dust inflow to Sahel. Likewise, setting the temporal derivative in equation 1 equal to zero and combining equations 1 and 2 , we can determine vegetation cover V as a function of mean growing season precipitation P ¯ . Equilibrium states of the system can then be determined as intersections of the corresponding curves in the P ¯ , V domain. The values of all the parameters used in this study are provided in Table 1 . The equilibrium states of the system are analyzed considering a variety of values of β strength of the dust-precipitation feedback , E 0 maximum rate of dust emission from the Sahel , and fraction of dust emissions from exogenous sources in the Sahara contributing to net dust inflow to Sahel, q .Previous studies have invoked land-atmosphere feedback resulting from vegetation control on surface albedo and/or evapotranspiration to explain drought persistence and the possible emergence of bistable dynamics of vegetation and precipitation in the Sahel. The role of dust as a factor determining drought persistence in the Sahel remains to be assessed. Dust can suppress rainfall via a decrease in convection due to surface cooling and atmospheric heating and/or an excess in the amount of cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei in the case of “cold cloud processes”. This study developed a minimalistic model to evaluate whether the feedback between precipitation and dust emissions could lead to the emergence of bistable ecosystem-climate dynamics in the Sahel.We first consider the case of local dynamics within the Sahel without accounting for the effect of external dust sources from the Sahara i.e., q  = 0 ; we find that the coupled dust-vegetation-precipitation dynamics may indeed exhibit two stable states: a relatively “dry and dusty” state with sparse vegetation cover and a relatively “wet and dust-free” state with more abundant vegetation cover. This bistable behavior is induced by the feedback Figure 2 a and tends to abruptly disappear as the strength β of dust-rainfall relationship decreases below a critical value β  < 109 mm AI − 1 . A weak dust-rainfall feedback entails only a limited reduction of rainfall per unit increase in aerosol index AI . Thus, in these conditions rainfall would be sufficient to sustain a vegetated/wet stable state regardless of the levels of mineral aerosol concentrations. Thus, values of β  > 109 mm AI − 1 are associated with the emergence of bistable dynamics. In these conditions, increase in dust emissions—resulting for example from land use change—could induce a substantial suppression of precipitation, thereby locking the system in a dry, poorly vegetated state Figure 2 a . a Stable solid line and unstable dashed line states as a function of strength of the dust-precipitation feedback β and b maximum seasonal dust emission rate E 0 at threshold of vegetation cover below which plants are too sparse to affect the wind-induced entrainment of dust in the atmosphere. Both plots refer to the case of Niamey. Parameters for both Figures 2a and 2b: fraction of total dust emissions from exogenous sources in the Bodele Depression contributing to net dust inflow to Sahel, q  = 0; parameters for Figure 2a: maximum rates of dust emission from barren landscapes in the Sahel, E 0  = 140 g m −2  gs −1 ; parameters for Figure 2b: strength of dust-precipitation feedback for Niamey, β  = 140 mm AI −1 for all other parameters, see Table 1 .Estimates of the maximum rates of dust emission E 0 from the Sahel remain highly uncertain due to the lack of field measurements and presence of cloud cover, which limits the use of satellite observations in the wet season. In this study we have estimated E 0 based on assumptions on soil characteristics and evaluated the sensitivity of the results with respect to changes in this parameter Figure 2 b . We have found that the dynamics are bistable within a relatively wide range of E 0 values. As E 0 exceeds a critical value, the only possible stable state would be with no vegetation cover. Such conditions, however, are not realistic, as the Sahel has been observed to be stable also in a vegetated state despite the decrease in vegetation cover and enhanced dust emissions observed during the recent multidecadal drought.We then account for teleconnections between Sahel precipitation and Saharan dust emissions and evaluate their effect on the bistable behavior of land-atmosphere dynamics. To this end, we consider the extreme case in which maximum growing season rates of dust emission E 0 from the Sahel are E 0  = 0 g m −2  gs −1 here gs −1 denotes “per growing season” . Dust can easily travel thousands of kilometers downwind of its source region, and dust sources in the Sahara are known for contributing to atmospheric dust in the Sahel. These source areas are hyperarid and therefore exhibit no vegetation cover. Thus, unlike dust emissions from the Sahel, Saharan dust is not expected to be coupled to the dynamics of vegetation and precipitation in the Sahel. We find that vegetation dynamics continue to exhibit alternative stable states for a wide range of values of q i.e., q  > 0.06 , where q is the fraction of dust emissions from exogenous sources i.e., the Bodélé Depression contributing to net dust inflow to Sahel Figure 3 . The factors affecting the values of q include mainly wind speed and their spatial gradients. The emergence of this bistable behavior is associated with a teleconnection between Sahel precipitation and Saharan dust emissions, whereby a positive feedback mechanism exists between wind speeds hence dust emissions in source areas such as the Bodélé Depression and precipitation in the Sahel equations 13 and 14 . Notice that if we turn off this teleconnection i.e., q  = 0 the dynamics exhibit only one stable state Figure 3 . However, if the endogenous feedback is accounted for, alternative stable states exist see case with q  = 0 in Figure 2 .Stable solid line and unstable dashed line states as a function of ratio q of total exogenous dust sources from the Bodele Depression in Chad as input to Sahel using rainfall parameters for Niamey. Parameters: maximum rates of dust emission from barren landscapes in the Sahel, E 0  = 0 g m −2  gs 1 ; other parameters can be seen in Table 1 . The values shown in Figure 3 are calculated as mean over 1000 realizations of the stochastic process. The coefficient of variation of vegetation cover not shown is negligible <1% for the vegetated state, while it varies between 10% and 24% for the unstable state. The dynamics are overall bistable as shown in the figure, although when q  = 0.1 there is a 5% probability that the dynamics exhibit only one stable vegetated state, while when q  = 1 there is a 15% probability that the dynamics are stable only in the unvegetated state.Overall, these results indicate that in the Sahel bistable dynamics of precipitation and vegetation may emerge with realistic values of the parameters either from local dust-precipitation-vegetation coupling or through teleconnections between Sahel precipitation and Saharan dust emissions Figure 1 . Inclusion of both local dust-precipitation-vegetation coupling and teleconnections between Sahel precipitation and Saharan dust emissions are expected to expand the range of environmental conditions in which vegetation-precipitation dynamics in the Sahel are bistable.Other studies have shown the possible existence in this region of positive land-atmosphere feedback associated with evapotranspiration or albedo. The compound effect of these two classes of land-atmosphere interactions i.e., mediated by evapotranspiration or dust emissions is expected to lead to the emergence of an even stronger bistable behavior."
16,dust particles clouds impact,"Long-range transport across the Atlantic in summertime does not enhance the hygroscopicity of African mineral dust. We present the first direct evidence that the hygroscopic properties of super micron >1 mu m African dust particles did not change despite undergoing long-range transport across the Atlantic toward the Caribbean. Concurrent measurements of chemical composition show that most of mineral dust was chemically unprocessed and externally mixed. A minor portion of mineral dust was internally mixed with sulfate and chloride similar to 13-24% by number or aggregated with sea-salt particles similar to 3-6% . Only dust particles aggregated with sea salt showed significant hygroscopic growth above 75% relative humidity RH , resulting in a decrease in extinction mass efficiency by up to a factor 2.2. All other dust particles did not take up significant amounts of water when exposed to up to 94% RH. These results demonstrate that the direct radiative effect of African dust in this region remained independent of RH and an external mixing state could be considered for evaluating the climate effects of dust. Mineral dust is an extremely important atmospheric constituent because of its remarkable global influence on climate. Dust particles affect the Earth's radiative budget directly via the scattering and absorption of solar and terrestrial radiation. Mineral dust can also have an indirect effect on cloud radiative properties by acting as cloud condensation nuclei CCN and ice nuclei IN . Since the interaction of particles with water changes their size, composition, and shape, and henceforth their optical properties, these radiative effects are strongly sensitive to the hygroscopicity of particles.While fresh mineral dust is highly nonhygroscopic, a number of laboratory studies have indicated that the uptake of hydrophilic species, such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, or oxidized organic species, by the dust surface can enhance its hygroscopicity. Soluble coatings on dust have been observed in the atmosphere during field measurements. Coagulation of dust with hygroscopic particles such as ammonium sulfate or sodium chloride has also been documented in the past. Therefore, dust hygroscopic properties may change as the dust undergoes atmospheric processing during long-range transport. An accurate description of the temporal evolution of dust hygroscopic properties is crucial to quantify dust impact on the climate system that is a challenge for models.Findings in the literature about dust hygroscopic properties show different results and are partly contradictory. Several studies have reported coating-induced enhancements in the hygroscopic properties of Saharan and Asian dust transported over a long range. By contrast, Pósfai et al . provided evidence that although Saharan dust particles were transported over long distances more than 3 days , their chemical composition can remain unaltered after transport, with no observed internal mixing or coating. Nonhygroscopic Asian dust particles were also observed in Chinese outflow. Hence, the extent to which mineral dust particles react and become hydrophilic is dictated by their origin and transport pathway and may differ from one area to another depending on meteorological conditions and air masses encountered. Further studies that analyze dust hygroscopic properties after long-range transport in various regions are needed to accurately model the impact of dust on climate.Large quantities of mineral dust are transported westward from North African desert source regions toward the Caribbean and the eastern coasts of North and South America. Most previous studies in this region have focused on the analysis of dust microphysical, chemical, and optical properties under ambient conditions. To date, only one publication has addressed the influence of relative humidity on the scattering properties of transported dust and found that only minor amounts of hygroscopic materials were associated with dust.Here we present direct measurements of the hygroscopic properties of Saharan mineral dust collected in Puerto Rico after its long-range transport across the Atlantic Ocean. We show that long-range transport did not result in changes in dust hygroscopicity and discuss the implications of these results for dust radiative effects.Aerosol samples were collected during the Dust Aging and Transport from Africa to the Caribbean Dust-ATTACk campaign, which was conducted in summer 2012 at the atmospheric observatory of Cabezas de San Juan CPR, 18°23′N, 65°37′W in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a Caribbean island dominated by northeasterly winds, which carry high concentrations of dust from Africa to this region, particularly during the boreal summer. Previous studies have also reported the presence of significant anthropogenic organic and sulfate fractions in this region, which are indicators of local and transported pollution from Europe.For the purposes of this study, a four-stage cascade impactor Dekati®, four-size range including >10, 2.5 to 10, 1 to 2.5, <1 µm was used to collect particles for microscopy study. Particles were collected on scanning electron microscopy SEM Cu grids mounted on nonhygroscopic polytetrafluoroethylene filters. The samples presented here were collected under two contrasting sets of conditions: 1 dusty conditions during an intense dust event, on 2 July 2012, and 2 regional background conditions during a transition period between two dust events, on 29 June 2012. Dust source regions were identified from the aerosol indexes derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument aboard the EOS-Aura platform and from numerical simulations of dust emissions using the dust production model developed by Marticorena and Bergametti . During the dust event, mineral dust was emitted from Mauritania, Western Sahara and Central Algeria in 24–25 June and reached Puerto Rico after 6–8 days of transport, as shown in Figure  S1 in the supporting information .Environmental scanning electron microscopy ESEM was used to analyze the size, shape, chemical composition, and hygroscopic properties of individual particles having diameters larger than 1 µm. High-resolution images of the particles were obtained using a ZEISS Evo® LS15 scanning electron microscope. An acceleration voltage of 15 kV and a beam current between 300 and 400 pA were used for the analysis. The particles were identified on the basis of their elemental spectrum, which was obtained with an energy dispersive X-ray microprobe EDX, Oxford Instruments, INCA Energy 350 at a relative humidity RH below 5%. Lighter elements C, N, and O and Cu from the SEM grids were excluded for the classification of the particles. A total of 450 particles were analyzed. Particles selected for analysis were separated by more than 1 µm such that when deliquescing, they would not come into physical contact.Particle hygroscopic properties were determined using a differentially pumped environmental chamber by examining the particle growth and phase transitions as a function of RH. The deliquescence point corresponds to the RH at which particles take up water to form a solution droplet. Samples were initially dried and then hydrated in a stepwise fashion. The RH in the chamber was incrementally increased by introducing a controlled amount of water vapor and by progressively increasing the pressure in the chamber. At each RH step, high-resolution images of each selected particle were taken. In order to ensure that equilibrium was reached, sample images were taken 5 min after stabilization of each RH level, and we checked that no change in particle size and shape occurred during this time.Samples were kept at a constant temperature using a Peltier stage as a control element and a diode to measure the sample temperature. ESEM analysis was performed at 4 ± 1°C, which allowed for a maximum RH of 94 ± 5%. At RH values above 94%, water condensed on the filters, making pressure and temperature in the sample chamber difficult to control. Therefore, no water uptake analyses above 94% RH are presented here. Prior to the analysis of ambient particles, RH in the sample chamber was controlled by measuring the hygroscopic growth and deliquescence point of laboratory-generated ammonium sulfate particles.Aerosol optical properties relevant to radiative transfer mass extinction efficiency, k ext ; single-scattering albedo, ω 0 ; and asymmetry factor, g were calculated as a function of RH using a discrete dipole approximation DDA model, DDSCAT version 7.3. For the calculation, 3-D shapes of particles were discretized into an array of dipoles with individual polarizabilities, as shown in Figure  S2 in the supporting information . Particle size and growth at different RH were determined from their ESEM images assuming the cross-sectional diameter equal to the volume equivalent diameter. Using these parameters, 3-D particles having compact aggregated spheres with distinct refractive indexes were simulated. All DDA computations were performed using more than 100,000 dipoles for a particle.Mie calculations of individual particles were also performed to determine k ext , ω 0 , and g using homogeneous mixing and core-shell models and assuming spherical single particles having the same volume as used in DDA calculations. Refractive indexes of mixed components were determined from their volume-weighted refractive indexes, based on the particle growth and phase transitions observed during ESEM measurements, as further detailed in the supporting information . DDA and Mie calculations were both performed at 550 nm wavelength.During the Dust-ATTACk campaign, aerosol volume size distributions were dominated by a well-defined coarse mode Figure  S3 in the supporting information , which contributed between 65% regional background conditions and 80% dust event of the total particle volume concentration. Particles with diameters smaller than 1 µm were not observed on the ESEM images under dry conditions because of the instrument detection limit. However, the accumulation mode particles were centered between 600 and 800 nm, and hydrophilic dust particles in this size range should have been detected after taking up water. Above 75% RH, occurrence of accumulation mode particles was observed on the ESEM images, but all these particles exhibited the same deliquescence point and hygroscopic behavior as NaCl particles. No significant hygroscopic growth arising from dust particles in the accumulation mode was observed in this study.Based on the EDX-ESEM analysis, coarse-mode diameter > 1 µm particles in Puerto Rico samples consisted of mineral dust, sea-salt, and metallic particles. Dust particles were defined as those containing at least one of Si, Al, Ca, or Fe. Sea-salt particles were recognized by their cubic/rectangular prism shape and the detection of both Na and Cl. Metallic particles were rich in Zn, Pb, or Cr, indicating a probable anthropogenic origin. Particles identified as mineral dust were divided into three subgroups, depending on the relative contribution of the characteristic elements: aluminosilicates for particles characterized by the dominance of Al and Si, quartz SiO 2 for those having only Si as major element, and calcite CaCO 3 for those enriched in Ca. The contribution of each particle type is listed in Table  1 . Dust particles contributed ~84% of the coarse-mode particle number concentration during the dust event and ~ 69% under regional background conditions. These results suggest that the local atmosphere was loaded under both conditions with large dust particles, which were mixed during their transport with particles of marine and urban/industrial origins.Aluminosilicate particles represented the majority 88% of the 450 dust particles analyzed. Quartz and calcite accounted for 7% and 5% of the dust particles analyzed, respectively. Only 19–27% by number of the dust particles studied with the ESEM were internally mixed, all of which were aluminosilicates. Based on their EDX spectrum, these particles were divided into three categories: S bearing, Cl bearing, and NaCl aggregated. Most of the mixing detected on aluminosilicate particles were associated with S, which is consistent with laboratory studies suggesting that sulfate coatings are favored on aluminosilicates rather than on calcium carbonates. Our observations of Cl-bearing aluminosilicate particles are somewhat surprising, since calcium-rich particles have previously been considered to be the most reactive with HCl. The uptake of chloride to form chloride coating could be the result of heterogeneous chemistry with chloride precursor gases liberated from sea-salt particles. Only a small fraction of mineral dust was found to be mixed with sea-salt particles, which confirms previous observations showing that dust–seasalt aggregation occurs only to a minor degree in the African plume outflow during its transport over Atlantic Ocean. The EDX-ESEM analysis did not reveal the presence of N-bearing dust particles in our samples, which indicates that mineral dust contained no or low amount of nitrate. Previous laboratory and field studies have shown that nitrate coatings are favored on calcite particles. Since calcite represented only a minor portion of the dust particles analyzed, most of mineral dust transported in the Caribbean was not expected to react readily with nitric acid. In addition, the altitude of transport of mineral dust from the Saharan desert to marine environment in the Caribbean could also explain this observed trend in dust mixing state.The altitude of dust transport was estimated using 5 day back trajectory calculations performed with the HYSPLIT Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model and the Global Data Assimilation System and observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization CALIOP carried on the CALIPSO satellite. As shown in Figure  S4 in the supporting information , these estimates indicate that the dust transport within the marine boundary layer MBL was limited to 1 day before reaching the CPR station; previously, dust transport occurred mostly in high-altitude layers above 1.5 km. The low mixing of dust with sea-salt particles was likely due to the dust transport at high altitudes during summertime. Moreover, the data showed that no potentially polluted European air masses reached Puerto Rico during the sampling period, which suggests that the mixing of dust with acidic gases is also limited during its transport as polluted air masses are not involved.Figure  1 shows ESEM images and EDX spectra of S- and Cl-bearing dust particles. Although the mixings are not physically apparent, they can be identified using the signals of S and Cl detected by the EDX analysis. As shown in this figure, the morphology of both sulfate- and chloride-containing dust particles did not change appreciably when exposed to RH values of up to 94%. Henceforth, internally mixed mineral dust remained nonhygroscopic; i.e., the S and Cl bearing did not enhance the water uptake capacity of the dust.ESEM images of a sulfate-coated dust particles and b chloride-coated dust particles exposed to increasing relative humidity 1–4 at T  = 5°C. EDS spectra of these particles are shown in Figures  1 a5 and 1 b5.There are several potential explanations for this behavior. First, the heterogeneous reaction of sulfate with dust may not lead to an increase of the water uptake under subsaturated conditions: previous studies have shown that mineral dust particles containing sulfate did not experience hygroscopic growth at 90% RH, which might be due to the presence of alkaline elements in these particles. Second, as shown in Figure  1 , the S and Cl mixing were not visible in the ESEM images, and the signals of S and Cl in the EDX spectra were low. This suggests low concentrations of sulfate and chloride on the surface of the dust particles. Finally, these mineral dust particles could also contain other insoluble species not detected by EDX, such as organic compounds. The hygroscopic properties of organic species are not well understood and depend strongly on their chemical nature. If insoluble organic compounds are present as surface films on soluble particles, the particle water uptake could be reduced. The presence of dust-associated organic compounds cannot be confirmed from our analysis, however, since organics readily decompose when exposed to an electron beam.Figure  2 a shows the hygroscopic behavior of an aluminosilicate particle partly attached to a soluble NaCl crystal. Particles were exposed to a RH that was increased from 5 to 94% in the ESEM. No change in morphology occurred as the RH increased from 5 to 75% RH. At 75% RH, however, deliquescence of the NaCl aggregate occurred, according to the same pattern of deliquescence as ambient NaCl Figure  2 b . The droplet formed a large exterior sphere attached to the aluminosilicate particle. As the RH increased to 94% RH, this droplet grew adjacent to the aluminosilicate particle and partially engulfed the dust particle. Except for the slight change in morphology due to this partial covering, the dust aggregate did not show more morphological changes, as was observed for the nonhygroscopic aluminosilicate Figure  2 c . Therefore, our results indicate that the hygroscopic growth of mineral dust in our samples is controlled by the deliquescence of NaCl aggregated to the dust surface and that the resulting deliquesced particles were not spherical, as previously observed by Wise et al ., Semeniuk et al ., and Freney et al ..ESEM images of a NaCl aggregated to dust particles, b relatively pure NaCl, and c relatively pure aluminosilicate exposed to increasing relative humidity 1–4 at T  = 5°C. EDS spectra of these particles are shown in Figures  2 a5, 2 b5, and 2 c5.The majority of transported dust particles did not show hygroscopic growth up to 94% RH, indicating that most dust particles were chemically unprocessed and externally mixed. The heterogeneous reaction of sulfate and chloride has only a minor effect on the hygroscopic properties of mineral dust. The main hygroscopic growth of mineral dust arose from water uptake by aggregated NaCl particles.We represent the impact of water uptake on particle size by plotting the hygroscopic growth factor GF , defined as the ratio of the particle diameter at a given RH to the particle diameter at 5% RH, for each particle type. Particle diameters were determined from the projected 2-D area assumed as the equivalent area of a spherical particle, as further detailed in the supporting information . As shown in Figure  3 a, GF was calculated for 29 NaCl particles, 50 S- and Cl-bearing dust particles, and 10 agglomerates of dust and NaCl. The measured GF for NaCl was compared with theoretical calculations based on the Köhler equations. Although deriving hygroscopic growth from 2-D ESEM images may overestimate the calculated GF, values retrieved for ambient NaCl particles were close to the theoretical values. Therefore, we are confident in applying this approach to determine the GF of mineral dust particles. We determined that the aggregation of mineral dust with NaCl particles was associated with an enhancement of the dust hygroscopicity, with a GF of 1.77 at 90% RH. a Hygroscopic growth factor GF , b scattering mass efficiency k ext , c single-scattering albedo ω 0 , and d asymmetry parameter g at λ  = 550 nm as a function of relative humidity for each particles type. Externally mixed dust particles, i.e., S, Cl, and Na, were not detected and are shown in dark grey circles, dust internally mixed with sulfate or chloride in grey diamonds, and relatively pure NaCl particles in blue triangles. Dust aggregated with NaCl particles is shown in black squares in Figure  3 a and is separated for the different dust mixing state with NaCl in Figure  3 b, with green squares representing the homogeneous mixing, purple squares for the core-shell mixing, and golden squares for the aggregate structure. GF and k ext of the total dust population red triangles were calculated using GF and k ext values of single dust particles and the contribution of each particle type.Figures  3 b– 3 d show k ext , ω 0 , and g at a wavelength of 550 nm calculated from the size of individual particles at different RH, the contribution of each particle type and by employing different optical models. As we observed that most of mineral dust survived atmospheric transport intact, we assumed a refractive index and a density for mineral dust of 1.53 − 0.002 i and 2.6 g cm −3 , respectively, which correspond to averages of the values reported in African source region, as discussed in the supporting information . For NaCl, we used values of 1.54 − 0.000 i and 2.2 g cm −3 for the refractive index and the density, respectively.The k ext of dust aggregated with NaCl decreased from 1.90 to 0.85 m 2  g −1 between 75% and 94% RH using DDA calculation, most likely due to the mutual shadowing among particles. These values were lower by up to 2.2 times than those obtained using volume-mixing and core-shell models. This indicates that the assumption employed in widely used optical models that deliquesced particles have spherical shapes could lead to a significant overestimation of the dust radiative effect. No significant change with RH in ω 0 of dust aggregated with NaCl was observed. NaCl particles are nonabsorbing ω 0 equal to unity . Therefore, dust mixed with NaCl particles is expected to have ω 0 equal or higher than those of pure dust particles. Optical parameters of the overall dust aerosol population were calculated using values for single dust particles and the contribution of each particle mixing state. We estimate that k ext , ω 0 , and g of the integrated dust aerosol population were 1.90 m 2  g −1 , 0.97, and 0.9, respectively, regardless of RH values. Similar results were obtained for dusty and background conditions not shown . Although dust particles in the accumulation mode were also observed during the Dust-ATTACk campaign Figure  S3 in the supporting information , our measurements were limited to supermicronic >1 µm particles, which represented the dominant fraction of dust mass. Supermicronic particles being the main contributors to the aerosol light absorption, we may have overestimated k ext and underestimated ω 0 relative to that in the atmosphere. However, our results clearly show that the enhancement of dust hygroscopicity was counterbalanced by the limited fraction of dust aggregated with sea-salt particles. The direct radiative effect of African dust after its long-range transport over the Atlantic Ocean was independent of RH.This work provided the first direct evidence that supermicronic dust particles remained externally mixed and nonhygroscopic despite undergoing long-range transport over the Atlantic Ocean. The heterogeneous reaction of sulfate and chloride had only a minor effect on the hygroscopic properties of mineral dust. The main hygroscopic growth was measured when NaCl particles were aggregated with mineral dust. However, the enhancement of dust hygroscopicity was counterbalanced by the limited fraction of dust aggregated with sea-salt particles.These findings are crucial for determining the impact of dust on climate. The arid regions of North Africa are the most prolific and persistent sources of mineral dust at the global scale, and the trans-Atlantic dust transport impacts large geographical areas in summertime. On the basis of our measurements, we demonstrated that the direct radiative effect of African dust in the Caribbean was independent of RH. Nonetheless, despite their nonhygroscopicity under subsaturated conditions, mineral dust can act as efficient CCN and IN due to their relatively large size and can have important implications for microphysical properties and precipitation efficiency of clouds. The CCN and IN properties of mineral dust are intimately linked to dust mixing state. In general, it was found that the condensation or coagulation of soluble compounds, such as sulfuric acid, on mineral dust increased CCN activity and reduced deposition IN activation. As dust particles in our samples remained mostly unaffected by atmospheric processing, our results suggest that an external mixing state should be considered in evaluating the climate effects of dust.The study presented in this paper focused on a single Saharan dust event sampled along the east coast of Puerto Rico. The conclusions drawn from this investigation are, however, likely to be relevant to dust events in summertime in the Caribbean. From 5 years ground-based measurements, Prospero and Mayol-Bracero reported a remarkable repeatability of the mass concentration of dust from Africa in the Caribbean in summertime, suggesting that the contribution of mineral dust to the air mass is probably quite similar for the different dust events uncounted in the Caribbean. Previous studies showed that the chemical composition of dust is rather uniform at Puerto Rico with almost no contribution of anthropogenic aerosols, making this site attractive for studying the properties of aerosol in pristine marine environment. As the Saharan trans-Atlantic transport in summertime occurs mostly in the Saharan Air Layer above the MBL, a low degree of internal mixing of dust with sea-salt particles is expected. Nevertheless, further field investigations for longer-term period and in different locations are required to determine how frequently mineral dust is externally mixed and remains nonhygroscopic after long-range transport across the Atlantic. Long-term sampling projects and systematic ESEM-EDX analysis would go a long way to addressing the dust mixing state and hygroscopicity in order to improve the representation of dust in climate models."
17,dust climate ocean,"Dust fluxes and iron fertilization in Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum climates. Mineral dust aerosols play a major role in present and past climates. To date, we rely on climate models for estimates of dust fluxes to calculate the impact of airborne micronutrients on biogeochemical cycles. Here we provide a new global dust flux data set for Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum LGM conditions based on observational data. A comparison with dust flux simulations highlights regional differences between observations and models. By forcing a biogeochemical model with our new data set and using this model's results to guide a millennial-scale Earth System Model simulation, we calculate the impact of enhanced glacial oceanic iron deposition on the LGM-Holocene carbon cycle. On centennial timescales, the higher LGM dust deposition results in a weak reduction of <10 ppm in atmospheric CO2 due to enhanced efficiency of the biological pump. This is followed by a further similar to 10 ppm reduction over millennial timescales due to greater carbon burial and carbonate compensation. Mineral dust aerosols in the atmosphere affect the climate directly by absorbing and scattering incoming solar and outgoing infrared radiation and indirectly by acting as ice nuclei. The deposition of dust on the Earth's surface also provides the terrestrial biosphere and surface ocean with micronutrients, affecting biogeochemical cycles. Early efforts to simulate dust deposition under past climatic conditions were conducted using various global climate models. Within the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project PMIP 2, dust simulations were performed using the CAM3-CCSM3 Mahowald et al ., hereafter CCSM and SPRINTARS-MIROC3 Takemura et al ., hereafter MIROC climate models. Recently, the PMIP 3 climate models MIROC-ESM and MRI-CGCM3 Yukimoto et al ., hereafter MRI also included dust in their paleoclimatic simulations. However, there are significant differences in dust load and spatial distribution among various dust simulations, even under modern conditions.From an observational perspective, paleoclimatic archives provide us with a record of past variability of dust deposition at specific locations. An extensive amount of Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum LGM dust flux measurements were compiled in the DIRTMAP database. These observations have varying analytical uncertainties, and the spatial distribution of the global data set is irregular. Globally, the LGM atmosphere is thought to have contained 3–4 times more dust than during the Holocene, which reflects the changes in the tropics, where most of the atmospheric dust is emitted. In remote regions far away from sources, LGM dust deposition has been found to be 2–3 times higher in the tropical and South Pacific, ~5 times higher in the South Atlantic and 20–30 times higher in polar regions.Dustborne iron fertilization of the nutrient-rich Southern Ocean SO waters and the subsequent sequestration of carbon in the ocean interior has been proposed as a driver of lower levels of atmospheric CO 2 during glacial periods of the late Pleistocene. In certain regions of the world's oceans known as “High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll” HNLC regions, macronutrients like nitrate and phosphate are abundant, but the lack of iron restricts oceanic primary productivity. It is argued that increased aeolian iron input during the LGM stimulated primary production, thus amplifying the actions of the biological and carbonate pumps that transport carbon down from the ocean surface. Artificial iron fertilization experiments have stimulated phytoplankton blooms, with more than half of the captured carbon potentially able to sink into the deep ocean. However, it is unclear how much of the sinking carbon returns to the ocean surface layers. Studies using paleoclimatic records of high southern latitudes to link dust deposition to marine productivity estimate that increased Last Glacial Maximum LGM dust deposition may have contributed up to 40% of the Holocene-LGM difference of 80–100 ppm in the partial pressure of atmospheric CO 2 p CO 2 . In contrast, many model studies that directly relate the ocean carbon cycles to fluctuations in dust deposition tend to assign a lower significance <20% to this phenomenon, although these models usually focus on biological productivity over centennial timescales and thereby neglect millennial-scale processes of carbon burial and carbonate compensation.Here we present a new interpolation of the unevenly spaced Holocene and LGM dust flux measurements compiled in the DIRTMAP database to two global grids. We compare our interpolated dust deposition fields with four climate model simulations of global dust flux to identify regions with large discrepancies. We use our interpolated dust fluxes to force a biogeochemical model and calculate the carbon export impact due to iron fertilization between Holocene and LGM climatic conditions. Together with a long Earth System Model simulation guided by results of the biogeochemical model, we estimate the centennial- and millennial-scale effects of carbon export changes on atmospheric p CO 2 levels.The spatial distribution of dust flux measurements has greatly improved in recent times, with the third version of the DIRTMAP database including almost twice the number of sites compared to the previous version. For this study we used 375 and 311 data points for average Holocene and LGM conditions, respectively, with additional data points not included in DIRTMAP 3 listed in Table  S1 in the supporting information SI . The data locations are sufficiently well distributed to perform a global interpolation on a T42 128 longitude × 64 latitude grid. At first order, the aerosol concentration in an air parcel decreases at an exponential rate with distance from the source. We extend this exponential relationship with distance to produce deposition fluxes, assuming in effect constant deposition velocities. This assumption is valid as we are considering multiyear average Holocene and LGM values and not seasonal variations and as dust flux is lognormally distributed on a large scale in all climate models SI Figure S3 . We do not account for the fact that the dry deposition velocity changes due to varying surface roughness; however, this is justified by the fact that in the majority of the world and particularly over land, wet deposition dominates. Large-scale precipitation and wind direction patterns result in directional variance that is around 4 times higher in the north-south direction than in the east-west direction. This anisotropy of the field results from the preferential zonal transport of dust by the main wind currents and was addressed in the directional semivariogram of the interpolation procedure see SI . Thus, we interpolated the logarithmic values of the measured dust fluxes using a Kriging algorithm Figure  1 . For loess data that usually contain a significant fraction of large dust particles that do not travel far, we used the PM10 particle diameter <10 µm fraction, whereas total dust deposition measurements from ice cores and marine sediments were considered as representing long-range transport. This primary stage is similar to the method used previously. Here we additionally corrected the variogram for the difference in distance represented by 1° of longitude at low and high latitudes see SI , thus, producing a global data set of yearly average dust fluxes for both Holocene and LGM conditions. The distribution of the original dust flux measurements, the interpolation, and the simulations of the four models we used are compared in SI Figure S3 and show the spatial lognormality of dust deposition. To force the biogeochemistry model, a monthly component was added by applying the ensemble median of the monthly variations around the yearly mean from the four climate models at each grid cell. top row Global maps of interpolated dust flux for Holocene and LGM conditions. Nonshaded and shaded areas show regions with interpolation uncertainty smaller and higher than the global mean Holocene: 0.35, LGM: 0.39 , respectively. bottom row Uncertainty of the interpolation due to the spatial density of dust flux measurements. Data points are indicated with a cross.The interpolated global dust flux grid was used to force the biogeochemical model NEMO-PISCES. Although the iron fraction of dust and the iron solubility are spatially and temporally variable, we kept these values constant as in previous simulations because of the lack of available observations. PISCES is a relatively complex ocean biogeochemical model that considers two phytoplankton size classes, two zooplankton grazers, two particle size classes, and five nutrients nitrate, phosphate, silicic acid, ammonium, and iron . The iron cycle in PISCES accounts for organic speciation, scavenging, and its variable biological uptake and considers iron sources from dust, rivers, sediments, and hydrothermal vents. The enhancement of nitrogen fixation through additional dust input in tropical oceans is present in PISCES simulations. We conducted simulations of 500 years where the dust field was replaced by the LGM and Holocene fields produced in this study. By coupling a well-mixed atmospheric reservoir, we were able to determine the influence of dust variations on atmospheric p CO 2 levels on centennial scales. Lastly, we conducted a 50,000 year simulation with the Danish Center for Earth System Science DCESS Earth System Model using the relative enhancement of high-latitude export production found in the shorter PISCES simulations. With its relatively sophisticated ocean sediment module, the DCESS model allows us to estimate the millennial-scale CO 2 effects of iron fertilization from carbon burial and carbonate compensation.On average, we find the interpolated global LGM dust flux to be about 4 times higher than during the Holocene Figure  1 , top row . This is in the upper range of previous estimates based on observational data and slightly higher than model results, which may reflect the recognized underestimation of dust over land in models. The uncertainty of the interpolation is indicated in Figure  1 bottom row . By definition and within the uncertainty of the observations which the models have to deal with as well for their validation , the interpolation is a more trustworthy estimate for dust fluxes than the models in the vicinity of measurement points. In Figure  1 top row the nonshaded areas correspond to data where the uncertainty is smaller than its global mean i.e., the more trustworthy half , whereas the shaded regions correspond to uncertainties higher than the mean.North and South American sources appear particularly more potent in the interpolation during the LGM than during the Holocene, something which is generally difficult to reproduce in models. A large part of the North Atlantic LGM dust deposition appears to originate from sources in North America and North Africa Figure  1 . Although dust in Greenland ice cores has traditionally been considered to originate in Asia, its isotopic signature remains ambiguous and few LGM reference samples have been measured. In our interpolation, Siberian and Alaskan LGM dust sources were very strong and may have also been potential contributors to Greenland dust. In the Southern Hemisphere, extremely low Holocene dust fluxes are observed in the subtropical South Pacific gyre, a situation that persists today in one of the most oligotrophic and iron-limited regions of the world. This characteristic appears not to have been present during the LGM, though, possibly due to enhanced dust transport from Australasia, but maybe also westward from the South American continent. The southern part of the LGM dust “plume” west of South America Figure  1 may be an interpolation artifact, as it goes against the prevailing westerly winds and there are few local measurements to constrain these values. In midlatitudes, however, aerosol incursions from coastal areas into these waters have been documented under modern conditions and one could imagine a scenario where dust from strong LGM sources in northern Chile was picked up by coastal lows and transported far into the Pacific via the Pacific subtropical high. In addition, model results also show a large incursion of South American dust into the southeast Pacific, even in the southern part of South America during LGM conditions. Although the effect of Australian and New Zealand sources are visible downwind of the source regions into the SW Pacific, the lack of terrestrial observational data from Australia results in a probable underestimation of dust fluxes over that continent in our data set. The uncertainty of the interpolation process Figure  1 , bottom row is a good indicator of where the interpolation is robust and where dust flux measurements are sparse and new measurements are most needed to better constrain the dust fields. The sparsity of terrestrial data available for the Holocene is due to the fact that loess deposition is largely limited to glacial periods. New observations from peat bogs in Siberia, North America, and South America are expected to fill this gap. The regions with largest uncertainty during the LGM are now located in the Indian Ocean and the oceanic subtropical Pacific.In Figure  2 we compare the spatial distribution of our dust flux interpolation with simulated output from the four climate models CCSM, MIROC, MIROC-ESM, and MRI . To account for biases in the interpolation and the climate models, we have standardized each data set by removing the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the logarithms of the dust fluxes dust fluxes are spatially lognormally distributed, see SI Figure S3 . In Holocene conditions these include large parts of the world's oceans, as well as the East Asian dust source regions. During the LGM there is a high confidence level for all major dust source regions except for Australia. Based on these results we suggest that dust models generally overestimate LGM dust deposition over West Africa and underestimate it over North America. All but the CCSM also underestimate Siberian LGM sources. Both MIROC models underestimate LGM South American sources. Finally, there are large discrepancies between all model outputs and the interpolation in the HNLC regions of the oceans. The South Pacific dust deposition especially seems to be underestimated in all models over both periods see also SI Figures S4 to S7 .Ratio of standardized global dust fluxes from various climate models with the standardized interpolated dust fluxes. The color scale shows powers of 10.To evaluate the initial impact of dust fluxes on the ocean carbon cycle, we forced the PISCES model with our interpolated dust deposition fields, providing estimates of oceanic carbon export for both Holocene and LGM conditions. During both periods, the main HNLC regions as illustrated by high simulated surface nitrate concentrations, Figure  3 a, left column are the SO and the subarctic North Pacific. Carbon export during both periods is highest where there is a substantial supply of nutrients to surface waters Figure  3 a, right column . During the LGM, the additional iron input from aeolian dust increases surface nutrient consumption and reduces preformed nutrient concentrations in line with increased carbon export by the more efficient biological pump in iron-limited regions, i.e., those with excess nitrate, in the Holocene Figure  3 b . High rates of LGM dust deposition in the North Atlantic also increased carbon export in this seasonally iron-limited region. The SO response is heterogeneous, with decreased nitrate and increased carbon export downwind of the South American and Australasian LGM sources, consistent with recent observations. However, there is little iron fertilization from LGM dust in the Antarctic sector of the SO, despite a large reservoir of available macronutrients. Our model results suggest that iron limitation in the Antarctic SO did not change markedly between Holocene and LGM scenarios, due to the preferential zonal transport of dust via the westerlies, which results in very low rates of iron deposition at high southerly latitudes under both Holocene and LGM conditions see Figure  4 and SI Figure S8 . a left column: Holocene and LGM surface nitrate concentrations mmol m −3 in color superposed with contour lines showing surface iron fluxes kg m −2  yr −1 in powers of 10. right column Holocene and LGM annual carbon export mol C m −2  yr −1 at 100 m depth. b Same as Figure  3 a but for the LGM-Holocene difference.Deposited dust masses and carbon export integrated over ocean basins ATL-Atlantic, IND-Indian, PAC-Pacfic; North is latitude > 30, Tropical is −30 > latitude > 30, South is −60 < latitude < −30, Antarctic is latitude < −60 for Holocene and LGM conditions. The crossed bars in the dust plot represent the model ensemble median. The North Atlantic NATL includes the Mediterranean, and the Tropical Indian Ocean TIND includes the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.Previous studies have suggested that about half the observed Holocene-LGM difference of 80–100 ppm in the atmospheric p CO 2 concentrations were due to a stronger stratification of the Antarctic SO and associated carbon buildup in the deep ocean, isolating CO 2 from the atmosphere. Much of the remaining difference has been attributed to a more efficient biological pump due to increased LGM iron fertilization of the subantarctic SO, whereby the solubility pump drawdown may have been compensated to a large degree by a decreased terrestrial biosphere and increased ocean salinity. However, in our 500 year PISCES simulation atmospheric p CO 2 was only reduced by <10 ppmv between the LGM and the Holocene, due to the enhanced dust-induced carbon sequestration via the soft tissue pump although there is an additional long-term effect discussed below . The small change in atmospheric p CO 2 , despite larger carbon export and overall greater absolute dust fluxes in most regions than in previous climate model simulations, suggests that enhanced global iron deposition only had a limited influence on atmospheric p CO 2 levels over centennial timescales. This is likely due to the role of other iron sources in the high-latitude SO and/or reduced CO 2 drawdown at low latitudes see discussion of Figure  4 b . Our results are similar to other ocean biogeochemical model simulations that estimate low atmospheric p CO 2 reductions 8–15 ppm due to increased LGM dust loads, although other box model studies still attribute a more substantial role ~35 ppm to iron fertilization.Figure  4 shows dust fluxes integrated over 1 year for the interpolation and the four climate models' CCSM, MIROC, MIROC-ESM, and MRI ensemble median, as well as the simulated PISCES ocean carbon export fluxes by ocean basin. Under Holocene conditions, the climate model median is within a factor 2 of the interpolated dust fluxes in most regions Figure  4 a . However, the SO and the North Pacific dust deposition are strongly underestimated by the climate models, which is significant since these are the HNLC regions that are most likely to respond to dust variations. Under LGM conditions, the models tend to underestimate dust increases in most regions, notably the North Atlantic, which in our interpolation receives a very large additional dust input from North American sources. Generally, the models tend to perform better in low than in high latitudes.Stronger glacial sources in Australia and New Zealand resulted in increased LGM dust deposition in the South Pacific. But despite the larger size of the ocean basin, the South Pacific only received about half as much dust as the South Atlantic. This suggests that Australian and New Zealand sources produced a lower absolute amount of dust than South American sources.Basin changes in the impact of dust iron on carbon export between the Holocene and the LGM depend on the role of iron limitation in each region and macronutrient transport by ocean currents. The main source of macronutrients for biological productivity in low latitudes is thought to be intermediate depth waters originating from the SO surface layers. Thus, any change in macronutrient concentrations of the subantarctic ocean will be conveyed to other ocean regions. In PISCES, the subantarctic south Atlantic and south Pacific Oceans are iron limited and we find additional carbon export due to the greater LGM dust supply Figure  4 b . Conversely, non-iron-limited regions such as the tropical oceans show a reduction of carbon export. More efficient biological carbon sequestration in iron-limited subantarctic regions reduces nutrient concentrations in the SO surface waters. Then, as expected, these local nutrient deficits are transported at intermediate depths toward low latitudes, reducing carbon export and thereby CO 2 drawdown when these waters upwell into tropical nitrate-limited regions. Any LGM reduction in subantarctic mode water production was not simulated in our simulations, but would exacerbate this effect. Thus, even if dust iron content and solubility had been higher during the LGM, it is likely that any greater carbon export in the SO would have been partially compensated for by reduced tropical carbon export. In PISCES, increased LGM dust deposition in the Antarctic SO was not sufficient to elevate iron-limited growth rates as was the case in other regions , causing little increase in Antarctic SO carbon export Figure  4 b and SI Figure S8 . Antarctic SO changes in marine productivity between glacial and interglacial climates may therefore have been largely driven by other factors, such as changes in ocean physics and/or sea ice extent.To estimate the complete iron fertilization effect at millennial timescales not possible by design with PISCES we conducted simulations using the DCESS Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity. The high-latitude phytoplankton growth rate limitation factor in the DCESS model was adjusted to mirror the ~20% increase in SO export production found in the PISCES LGM simulation due to dust-driven iron fertilization Figure  4 b . When forced by these enhanced growth rates, the DCESS model simulations showed p CO 2 reductions of 8.3 ppm from the standard, preindustrial simulation after 500 years in good agreement with PISCES model results and 10.3, 15.3, 17.7, and 19.8 ppm after 1000, 10,000, 25,000, and 50,000 years, respectively. The long-term p CO 2 reductions are due to enhanced organic carbon burial in ocean sediments and carbonate compensation that draws down the ocean inventory of dissolved inorganic carbon and thereby p CO 2 . Enhanced burial also draws down the ocean inventory of phosphate, the master nutrient of this model. This leads to a slow overall production decrease but with retained enhancement of high-latitude new production SI Figure S9 .We present here two interpolated global data sets of dust fluxes for both average Holocene and LGM climatic conditions, based on measurements in various paleoclimatic archives. A comparison with PMIP2 and PMIP3 model outputs suggests that most climate models seem to put too much emphasis on the North African sources and underestimate sources in Asia and the Americas. In particular, models underestimate dust deposition in HNLC regions.A global ocean biogeochemical model forced with the interpolated dust fields simulated a small global reaction of the carbon cycle to strongly increased LGM ocean dust deposition. The LGM-Holocene carbon export changes display a clear difference between high and low latitudes, with the iron-limited polar oceans and the nitrate-limited tropical oceans showing a large increase and decrease, respectively. This tropical ocean decrease kept the global effect of iron fertilization on atmospheric p CO 2 below 10 ppmv over centennial timescale. A supplementary Earth System Model simulation showed an additional atmospheric p CO 2 drawdown of ~10 ppm on multimillennial timescales due mainly to enhanced ocean carbon burial. Thus, predictions from ocean biogeochemistry models are underestimates of the millennial-scale impact of iron fertilization on atmospheric CO 2 . Based on our results, the LGM atmospheric p CO 2 was reduced by ~20 ppm due to enhanced dust loads and the associated iron fertilization of the oceans. Hence, it is likely that besides ocean stratification and iron fertilization, additional processes must be significant contributors to low glacial CO 2 levels."
18,dust,"How well do simulated last glacial maximum tropical temperatures constrain equilibrium climate sensitivity?. Previous work demonstrated a significant correlation between tropical surface air temperature and equilibrium climate sensitivity ECS in PMIP Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project phase 2 model simulations of the last glacial maximum LGM . This implies that reconstructed LGM cooling in this region could provide information about the climate system ECS value. We analyze results from new simulations of the LGM performed as part of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP5 and PMIP phase 3. These results show no consistent relationship between the LGM tropical cooling and ECS. A radiative forcing and feedback analysis shows that a number of factors are responsible for this decoupling, some of which are related to vegetation and aerosol feedbacks. While several of the processes identified are LGM specific and do not impact on elevated CO2 simulations, this analysis demonstrates one area where the newer CMIP5 models behave in a qualitatively different manner compared with the older ensemble. The results imply that so-called Earth System components such as vegetation and aerosols can have a significant impact on the climate response in LGM simulations, and this should be taken into account in future analyses. The last glacial maximum LGM is defined as the period during the last glacial-interglacial cycle when ice sheet volume was at a maximum, from 23 to 19 kyr B.P. before present . This period has been a focus of paleoclimate study for several decades, because it constitutes an example of a near-equilibrium global climate state which is very different from today's. Several global synthesis of paleo-environmental reconstructions have been produced, and these allow coupled climate model simulations of this time period to be evaluated in detail.The climate of the LGM is characterized by large ice sheets which dominated the Northern Hemisphere e.g., as reconstructed by analyzed some of these issues in more detail by decomposing the climatic feedbacks operating in response to increased and decreased atmospheric CO 2 and in response to LGM boundary conditions which include reduced GHG levels . They found differences in the cloud feedback operating in response to warmer versus colder climates which are thought to derive from a simulated displacement of mixed-phase clouds in the model. The results of restricted the analysis to the tropics. Using an expanded ensemble of seven PMIP2 models, they showed a statistically significant relationship between model ECS and simulated LGM tropical cooling. This is likely because the dominant driver of tropical temperature change is GHG forcing in these LGM simulations. postulated that combining reconstructions of LGM tropical temperatures and model results could provide constraints on the real climate system ECS value.The LGM simulation is now a core part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP phase 5 meaning that many models used to project future changes or to perform idealized perturbation experiments are also evaluated under paleoclimate boundary conditions. The models used in CMIP5 also differ markedly from those used in CMIP3 and PMIP2. In addition to increases in the level of complexity in various process representations, many of the models now include Earth System components such as dynamic vegetation or interactive aerosols. We therefore expand the analysis of to include results from nine model simulations of the LGM from CMIP5-PMIP3. This follows a similar analysis in also shown in the IPCC AR5 which showed that the relationship between ECS and LGM temperature anomalies was less robust in the CMIP5 models than in the PMIP2 simulations. Here we address this issue directly by analyzing the radiation budget in each simulation and comparing with the results from idealized abrupt4×CO 2 simulations.CMIP5 data were obtained for piControl, lgm, and abrupt4×CO 2 experiments. The latter were averaged over years 101–150. A list of models analyzed with their calculated equilibrium climate sensitivities is given in Table  S1 in the supporting information . We derive equilibrium climate sensitivities for the CMIP5 models using the method of and use values for the PMIP2 models from. This has been used in many previous studies. Essentially at a grid box level for each model, monthly mean total cloud cover and radiation diagnostics for the surface and top of the atmosphere TOA for all-sky and clear-sky conditions are used in a simplified representation of the surface and atmospheric properties to calculate the contributions from the land surface albedo, clouds, and clear-sky atmospheric absorption and scattering to the short-wave forcing and feedbacks operating in the model. These values are summarized for the PMIP2 and PMIP3 models in Figure  2 which shows short-wave cloud feedbacks and Figure  3 , for other fields. Both figures show averages over the tropics, the focus of this work. A similar analysis of the abrupt4×CO 2 simulations is shown in the supporting information .Short-wave cloud radiative feedbacks in PMIP2, PMIP3, and abrupt4×CO 2 simulations. The SW cloud feedback is calculated using the approximate partial radiative perturbation method and is normalized by the simulated surface temperature change averaged over the same region. The linear regression of the PMIP2 models is shown by the black line.Tropical regional averages of surface temperature anomalies and short-wave SW and long-wave LW radiative feedbacks in PMIP2 and PMIP3 LGM simulations compared to the respective preindustrial control simulations. SW terms are calculated using APRP method, while the LW terms are calculated as described in the text. The LW cloud term is calculated as the difference between TOA all-sky and clear-sky fluxes.The long-wave LW fluxes are also shown in Figure  3 for the LGM see the supporting information for the abrupt4×CO 2 simulations . The greenhouse gas forcing is calculated from the 2×CO 2 for PMIP2 models or 4×CO 2 for CMIP5 models greenhouse gas forcing, scaled to the LGM GHG change following, which were based on slab ocean runs. The PMIP2 ECS values derived from the Gregory analysis strengthens the negative correlation between climate sensitivity and the lgm-piControl tropical temperature change for each model, changing from −0.75 to −0.79. However, the same analysis conducted for PMIP3 models shows that this relationship does not hold. The correlation is close to zero, with PMIP3 models showing similar levels of cooling at the LGM but with a wide range of ECS values. A similar analysis for the abrupt4×CO 2 simulations with these same models conducted as part of CMIP5 shows a strong relationship between ECS and tropical warming, and this is shown in the supporting information Figure  S1 . Thus, the question arises as to why this relationship appears to apply in the PMIP2 CMIP3 LGM models but not in the newer CMIP5 ensemble.Five of the PMIP3 models fall close to the PMIP2 relationship between ECS and Figure  S2 demonstrates that the relationship between ECS and temperature anomalies is only weakly evident in the North Atlantic in PMIP3, while in the PMIP2 models it is evident across much of the tropics as shown before . Additionally, the relationship is shown to hold for the four models in PMIP2 for which full radiation diagnostics are available.Since the SW feedbacks from clouds are known to play a pivotal role in the intermodel spread in climate sensitivity this is analyzed first. Figure  2 shows SW cloud radiative feedback as a function of climate sensitivity. The SW cloud terms are divided by the simulated tropical temperature change in this comparison. The feedback strength increases across most models as a function of ECS consistently across the two different experiments. MIROC-ESM and MRI-CGCM3 show the largest exceptions with clear differences between the warmer and cooler scenarios. MIROC-ESM shows relatively weak SW cloud effect given its high climate sensitivity. The discrepancy is much larger for the lgm simulation compared to the abrupt4×CO 2 simulation, a point we return to below. MRI-CGCM3 behaves in the opposite sense and shows a stronger cloud feedback than would be expected from its ECS value given the behavior of the other models . In this case the LGM simulation also shows a weaker cloud SW feedback than the abrupt4×CO 2 simulation. The majority of the other models, however, show a reasonable agreement in terms of the strength of the cloud feedback, demonstrating symmetry in cooler versus warmer climate states. Apart from MIROC-ESM and MRI-CGCM3, this suggests that decoupling between the tropical temperature change and ECS in PMIP3 is related to processes other than SW radiative effects of clouds.The remaining short-wave radiation budget terms are compared in Figure  3 . There is great variability in the SW cloud term across both the PMIP2 and PMIP3/CMIP5 lgm ensembles. In contrast the SW surface albedo term is much more variable in the newer PMIP3/CMIP5 ensemble. The largest value found in MRI-CGCM3 is caused by prescribing bare soil areas over new land areas for the LGM in this model K. Yoshida, personal communication, 2014 . The clear-sky SW term is comparable across the two ensembles.The long-wave LW radiation budget averaged over the tropics is also summarized in Figure  3 . The total GHG forcing is similar in PMIP2 and PMIP3 models. The range is slightly smaller in the former with a range of −3.0 to −2.7 W m −2 compared to −3.3 to −2.8 W m −2 in PMIP3. The clear-sky TOA minus surface LW flux corrected for this forcing is shown in Figure  3 and demonstrates a similar range in the two ensembles. Finally, the LW cloud feedbacks are distributed more widely in the PMIP3 lgm ensemble range: −0.1 to 2.5 W m −2 than in PMIP2 range: 0.6 to 1.3 W m −2 .MIROC-ESM is the only model with a significant change in the aerosol loading. This stems from the inclusion of interactive mineral dust emissions and interactive vegetation. The dust emissions and their radiative effects are modeled using the SPRINTARS model which has been used previously for the LGM. The results from can therefore help in the interpretation of processes operating in MIROC-ESM. The total column dust loading is also similar in the simulations of and MIROC-ESM, with preindustrial burdens of 14 and 12 Tg, respectively, and LGM burdens of 31 and 34 Tg, respectively.In MIROC-ESM the aerosol optical depth AOD at 550 μm shows much larger overall changes than in the abrupt4×CO 2 simulation not shown , and this is confirmed by the SW clear-sky feedback term, which is −1.2 W m −2 . MIROC-ESM also includes dynamic vegetation which makes a contribution over the tropics. Additionally, there is a substantial decrease in the albedo over the Sahara and this acts to further reduce cooling over the tropics. The SW surface albedo term is positive 0.2 W m −2 in MIROC-ESM for the tropics, mostly as a result of the albedo change over the Sahara Figure  3 .MIROC-ESM also includes the first and second indirect effects of mineral dust aerosols see Table  S1 in the supporting information . The lgm-piControl anomaly of the effective cloud top particle radius shows a significant global decrease symptomatic of the first aerosol indirect effect. Using the same aerosol model calculated a global radiative forcing due to SW indirect effects of dust at the LGM of +0.90 and +0.66 W m −2 at the tropopause and surface, respectively. An aerosol-induced positive SW indirect effect in MIROC-ESM could therefore account for some of the difference of the SW cloud feedback relative to the 4 × CO 2 simulation as shown in Figure  2 . The LW indirect aerosol effects simulated by are also important but with opposing values of −1.96 W m −2 and +0.22 W m −2 at the tropopause and surface, respectively.The analysis over the tropics shows that MIROC-ESM has the smallest SW feedback factors from any of the models analyzed, despite having the highest climate sensitivity and showing the second highest SW feedback value in the abrupt4×CO 2 experiment.The outstanding term in the energy balance for CNRM-CM5 is the effective greenhouse gas forcing. This term is only −8.4 W m −2 compared to the multimodel averages of −12.1 ± 1.8 W m −2 for PMIP3 and −11.6 ± 1.7 W m −2 for PMIP2 clear-sky TOA surface, Figure  3 . CNRM-CM3 in PMIP2 shows a similarly small value for this term −8.9 W m −2 . Interestingly, the same term in the abrupt4×CO 2 simulation by CNRM-CM5 is close to the ensemble average value. This suggests that the model behaves nonlinearly in response to a cooler climate compared to a warming climate. In CNRM-CM5 compared to CNRM33 there is i an increase in the ECS value and ii a smaller LW cloud feedback term. These two terms combined induce a nearly 1 W m −2 difference between the two CNRM models. Unfortunately, not enough fields are stored in the PMIP2 database to perform the APRP analysis of the CNRM-CM3 PMIP2 simulation. Overall, the behavior in CNRM-CM5 is the least understood and future work is required to resolve this.GISS is the only model run with prescribed LGM vegetation distributions. GISS-E2-R simulates extreme cooling −17.5°C , over middle- to high-latitude Asia land points in the region 55–120°E by 45–75°N possibly more as a result of the sensitivity of snow-covered vegetation albedo than because of the vegetation distribution imposed, since other PMIP3/CMIP5 models with large reductions in tree cover simulate substantially less cooling e.g., in MPI-ESM-p cooling is −10.3°C and in MIROC-ESM it is −11.1°C and the cooling in GISS-E2-R is substantially larger than indicated by the pollen-based temperature field reconstruction from. This enhanced extratropical cooling causes snow to persist north of 40–50°N throughout the year in Asia see Figure  S4 and therefore likely contributes a cooling signal at lower latitudes similar to the cooling induced by the imposition of LGM ice sheets. Thus, teleconnections, including a reduction in atmospheric water vapor act to enhance cooling in the tropics. The latter can be seen in the LW clear-sky TOA minus surface flux Figure  3 for which GISS has the largest value of any of the LGM simulations, despite having a smaller than average value in the abrupt4×CO 2 simulation see Table S3 . GISS-E2-R also has vegetation changes in the tropics, and the surface albedo effect from these is relatively large with an average forcing of −1.4 W m −2 see Figure  3 . Only MRI-CGCM3 has a larger surface albedo contribution. Together, these factors help to explain the magnitude of the LGM tropical cooling in GISS-E2-R.Our analyses demonstrate that there is no coherent relationship between climate sensitivity and tropical change in CMIP5 models, and we identify several mechanisms of climate change specific to the last glacial maximum that introduce this heterogeneity. These are i aerosol direct and indirect effects arising from changes in aerosol loading or because of interactions between the physical climate, aerosols and clouds; ii surface albedo changes due to prescribed or interactively modeled vegetation changes. and iii changes in atmospheric emissivity due to water vapor, possibly driven by prescribed vegetation changes. Overall, we find that the CMIP5 LGM ensemble shows qualitatively different behavior from the older PMIP2 ensemble.The correlation between ECS and tropical temperature changes is positive in both the RCP8.5 and abrupt4×CO 2 simulations see supporting information Figure  S1 . The abrupt4×CO 2 output shows relatively little change in global vegetation distributions in the CMIP5 models which include dynamic vegetation, while the changes in aerosol loading are smaller than those simulated for the LGM in these models.Together, these factors demonstrate that the PMIP3 ensemble cannot be used all together to infer climate sensitivity as was the case in PMIP2. This is because the model simulations are not drawn from an identical experimental design, but instead span a range of model component and boundary condition choices. However, the majority of models show reasonable agreement in terms of LGM tropical cooling, with 7 and 12 of the models shown in Figure  1 lying within the upper and lower reconstruction ranges, respectively, of. The model also simulates snow cover persisting into summer in this area at the LGM, indicating potential ice sheet inception, which is not supported by reconstructions. Thus, if the extratropical and tropical cooling are related in this model, then the fact that it is an outlier in terms of the ECS to tropical temperature relationship is more likely a result of oversensitivity of the model to cold conditions, as opposed to a manifestation of uncertainty in the ECS to tropical behavior for the LGM.If the next multimodel ensemble of LGM simulations consistently included similar Earth System components, would we revive a clear found a statistically significant relationship between tropical cooling and equilibrium climate sensitivity in PMIP2 coupled GCM simulations of the LGM. Here we analyze the tropical climate changes in CMIP5/PMIP3 last glacial maximum simulations and show that this relationship does not hold in this newer multimodel ensemble. Although there is some evidence that model performance plays a role in this decoupling, the inclusion of Earth System components, such as dynamic vegetation and interactive aerosols in some models is also important. Careful evaluation of the relative strengths of these additional feedbacks is required; otherwise, simulated climate anomalies could even be right for the wrong reasons, potentially leading to erroneous inferences about climate sensitivity in this context. Until a larger ensemble of models including Earth System components are available, we cannot say whether there is a useable relationship between tropical cooling and climate sensitivity which can be exploited to infer climate sensitivity from reconstructions of LGM tropical temperature anomalies."
19,dust aerosol climate particles clouds,"Seasonal variability of heterogeneous ice formation in stratiform clouds over the Amazon Basin. Based on 11months of polarization lidar observations in the Amazon Basin near Manaus, Brazil 2.3 degrees S, 60 degrees W , the relationship between temperature and heterogeneous ice formation efficiency in stratiform clouds was evaluated in the cloud top temperature range between -40 and 0 degrees C. Between -30 and 0 degrees C, ice-containing clouds are a factor of 1.5 to 2 more frequent during the dry season. Free-tropospheric aerosol backscatter profiles revealed a twofold to tenfold increase in aerosol load during the dry season and a Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and ClimateInterim Implementation reanalysis data set implies that the aerosol composition during the dry season is strongly influenced by biomass burning aerosol, whereas other components such as mineral dust do not vary strongly between the seasons. The injection of smoke accompanied by the likely dispersion of biological material, soil dust, or ash particles was identified as a possible source for the increased ice formation efficiency during the dry season. The Amazon Basin is considered as one of the tipping elements of Earth's climate system, but little is known on the interaction of its unique ecosystem with meteorological processes. The biological activity over the forest is responsible for the emissions of primary biological particles as well as the emission of volatile organic compounds that form secondary organic aerosol particles. The human activity in the Amazon Basin produces a variety of local aerosols that provide the nuclei for cloud droplets and ice crystals whose properties are important in the formation of precipitation. Another source of aerosols over the Amazon Basin is long-range transport of mineral dust and biomass burning smoke from the African continent that also contribute to the local population of cloud droplet and ice nuclei.One key component for the production of significant amounts of precipitation is the formation of ice crystals that are required to produce sufficiently large hydrometeors via the cold rain process. It is well known that in particular the efficiency of heterogeneous ice nucleation that occurs at temperatures between −37 and 0 ∘ C depends strongly on the type of ice nucleating particle INP , i.e., the aerosol type, as well on the humidity and temperature of the atmosphere. Under otherwise constant conditions variations in the aerosol properties can therefore affect the microphysical structure of clouds, which had been observed previously.In this study, we present a lidar-based statistical analysis of the occurrence of heterogeneous ice formation in stratiform cloud layers that were observed near Manaus, Brazil, between January and November 2008—thus covering both the wet and the dry season. The lidar observations provide the unique chance to evaluate possible effects of the seasonal variation of the aerosol properties on the efficiency of heterogeneous ice formation under ambient conditions over the Amazon Basin. In section 2 the observational principle and the methodology are presented. Results of the analysis of the mixed-phase cloud data set are presented in section 3 . In section 4 the findings are summarized and concluded.Between January and November 2008, continuous observations with the Raman polarization lidar Polly XT were carried out 60 km north of Manaus, Brazil 2.3 ∘ S, 60 ∘ W in the framework of EUCAARI European Integrated Project on Aerosol, Cloud, Climate, Air Quality Interactions and Amazonian Aerosol Characterization Experiment 2008. The lidar measurements were analyzed previously with respect to the aerosol conditions present in the lower troposphere during the wet and dry season by, who report that the dry season features a much higher aerosol load, predominantly caused by biomass burning aerosol.Besides the vertical structure of the aerosol profile, cloud layers were observed frequently during the measurement period. The observed cloud layers were classified as either ice containing or pure liquid in accordance to the methodology applied previously by,, and. Here the procedure is thus only explained briefly. We define a single cloud layer when it is separated from adjacent ones by 500 m in the vertical and by 5 min in time. If the vertical or temporal distance between two layers is less, they are defined as one layer. Above the apparent top of the cloud layer the lidar signal-to-noise ratio must be at least 3% above the background noise level of the average cloud-containing profile. This requirement ensures that the data set contains only cloud layers that could be penetrated by the lidar beam in order to obtain an accurate measure of the cloud top height. In the next step, the depolarization ratio profile is obtained for the identified cloud layer. Hereby, layers containing ice crystals can be identified by means of an increased depolarization ratio when being observed by an off-zenith-pointing lidar as it is the case for Polly XT pointing 5 ∘ off zenith . Spherical particles, such as cloud droplets, do not produce depolarization. Nevertheless, a cloud layer is only identified as ice-containing when increased values of depolarization are observed at its very base including potential ice virgae , as multiple scattering in liquid cloud layers can also cause a linear increase of the depolarization with increasing cloud penetration depth. Because lidar can only penetrate optical depths of up to 3 and we require that the signal is not attenuated above a cloud layer, the data set is restricted to thin stratiform cloud layers, similar to those identified in a satellite-based study of. The cloud layers did not necessarily have to contain a liquid layer at top. Thus, the class of ice-containing clouds also comprises cirrus clouds. It is known that temperature is the main parameter controlling the efficiency of heterogeneous ice nucleation. Hence, the temperature at the top of every identified cloud layer is obtained from GDAS1 data that are based on the global data assimilation system GDAS Global Data Analysis System, http://ready.arl.noaa.gov/gdas1.php , grid point: and evaluated the accuracy of GDAS1 data against collocated atmospheric soundings and found a mean standard deviation of less than 1 K for the middle troposphere where the mixed-phase clouds are usually observed.The direct observation of the aerosol properties in the vicinity of each cloud layer is difficult to archive because often the presence of surrounding or lower cloud layers prohibit the determination of a cloud-free backscattering profile from the lidar measurement. The approach to characterize the aerosol properties in the free troposphere was thus twofold. First, the Polly XT data set presented previously by was screened for upper level clouds to obtain the aerosol optical properties for the upper troposphere. Second, reanalysis data of the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate—Interim Implementation MACC was obtained for nine grid points surrounding the observation site central MACC grid point: 2.25 ∘ S, 60.75 ∘ W . The MACC data set provides profiles of the mass mixing ratio of mineral dust for three size intervals 0.03–0.55  for details , the difference in freezing efficiency between dry and wet season can be considered to be significant throughout the investigated temperature range. In addition to the statistics shown in Figure  1 , tests were performed to check the consistency of the cloud data set. First, as was also done by, we checked the response of the statistics to seeding effects, which can occur when sedimenting ice crystals from an upper level ice-containing cloud trigger ice formation in a supercooled liquid cloud beneath that otherwise would have not formed ice. Second, also the clouds with undetermined cloud top were incorporated in the statistical analysis assuming that the highest data point with signal above the background level is the apparent cloud top . Third, we analyzed the data set separately for daytime and nighttime cases to check for daylight effects on the lidar measurements. The three tests revealed similar differences in the ice-containing cloud fraction between wet and dry season as is shown in Figure  1 .Fraction of ice-containing clouds as function of cloud top temperature in intervals of 5 K for the wet blue and dry season red . Number of clouds per interval is shown in the header. Error bars indicate the statistical uncertainty.It should be noted that ice formation does not necessarily need to be completely absent when no ice signatures are observed with polarization lidar. As point out, the optical extinction and correspondingly the backscatter signal of ice crystals is very low for low crystal concentrations as they are produced at rather high temperatures of above −10 ∘ C. The detection threshold with respect to ice water content lies approximately in the range of 1 × 10 −6  kg m −3 . Consequently, the increase in the fraction of ice-containing clouds between the wet and the dry season can be interpreted as a respective increase in the ice water content resulting from an increase in the number of ice nuclei. This would be in agreement to a satellite-based study of, who found that the ice water path produced by clouds with cloud top temperatures between −15 and −25 ∘ C embedded in mineral dust is up to 11.5 × 10 −3  kg m −2 larger than in clouds not embedded into dust layers. Nevertheless, as discussed, the lidar-based findings of freezing thresholds are in good agreement to the onset temperatures of ice formation reported in laboratory studies.In order to evaluate the relationship between the efficiency of heterogeneous ice production and the ambient aerosol conditions, the vertical distribution of aerosol properties in the Manaus area are depicted in the following.First, measurements of the particle backscatter coefficient measured with Polly XT at 532 nm wavelength are investigated. In Figure  2 , box plots of the mean profiles of wet and dry season, respectively, for the height range from 5 to 10.5 km are shown. The seasonal mean GDAS1 temperature profiles are shown in addition. It can be seen that the mean temperature profiles are similar for wet and dry season. Median and mean values of the particle backscatter coefficient are similar indicating that the data points are evenly distributed and only few extreme scenarios were observed. Nevertheless, a rather large variability of the observed backscatter coefficients is indicated by the wide range of data points covered by the 25%/75% percentiles, depicted by the boxes. Besides the observed variability, mean and median values are constantly larger during the dry season. At heights above 6.5 km −10 ∘ C , backscatter coefficients obtained for the dry season exceed the respective wet-season values by a factor of 2 to 10. As was shown by, an increase in backscatter coefficient will scale linearly with the number of ice nuclei for otherwise constant aerosol properties. Taking this assumption granted, the INP concentration during the dry season will exceed the wet-season values by a factor of 2 to 10.Mean circles , median center of boxes , and 25/75 percentiles bottom and top of boxes of the particle backscatter coefficient at 532 nm wavelength for the wet and dry season obtained from Polly XT observations as described in. Mean GDAS1 temperature profiles for both seasons are shown in addition.The very low background values of the aerosol particle backscatter coefficient above the lidar site do not allow to infer further information on the particle type from the available lidar measurements, such as particle depolarization ratio or extinction coefficient. We thus use the reanalysis of the vertical profiles of the mixing ratio of different aerosol types modeled by MACC to estimate the seasonal variability of the presence of different main aerosol types. Figure  3 presents the vertical profiles for the temperature range between −40 and 0 ∘ C. Overall, it can be seen that the aerosol load during the dry season is calculated to exceed the values for the wet season at all temperature levels. Two main features are visible. First, the total dust aerosol load is similar for both seasons. During the dry season, however, more dust mass is contained in the size ranges from 0.55–20 , the sources of sulfates and carbon in the model are linked to fire emissions, both natural and anthropogenic, plus emissions from domestic, industrial, power generation, transport, and shipping activities. Due to its low ice nucleation efficiency, an increase in black carbon cannot solely explain the observed increase in the ice-containing cloud fraction. It should, however, be noted that emissions of much more ice-nucleation-efficient mineral dust particles in MACC are not related to fire emissions, even though it is known that considerable amounts of mineral dust are emitted during fire events. From polarization Raman lidar measurements in Cyprus it was, for example, concluded that mineral dust contributes 10–50% to the optical extinction of smoke plumes, corresponding to a contribution between 25 and 80% to the aerosol mass. Measurements of the dust fraction in lofted Amazonian biomass burning plumes were not reported yet, but surface in situ observations in the Amazon Basin analyzed by suggest that the dust fraction is lower in that region than over Cyprus. For both the dry and wet season, observations in the vicinity of biomass burning activity yield a soil dust fraction of approximately 4% of the total particulate mass and a fraction between soil dust and black carbon of 50–60%. These ratios are constant between both seasons, but the absolute particulate mass and thus the soil dust mass reported by was 4–5 times larger during the dry season than during the wet season 38.5 , relate the major fraction of the observed coarse-mode aerosol PM 10 to primary biological emissions. In the vicinity to biomass burning, respective values of PM 10 for the dry season were found to be a factor of 1.5 higher than during the wet season. Similar measurements in a pristine environment without nearby biomass burning activity revealed slightly lower values of coarse-mode aerosol and thus reduced primary biological emissions during the dry season. Also, soil dust concentrations reach rarely more than 2% of the total particulate matter at the pristine site. During the wet season, enhanced values of soil dust are only observed when the position of the intertropical convergence zone is located south of Manaus, allowing long-range transport of dust from Africa.Ashes are another byproduct of biomass burning activity. Their ice nucleation efficiency is considered to be similar to those of mineral dusts. investigated the ice nucleation of four different types of combustion ashes. They identified wood burning ash as the most efficient type, being the second most efficient nonbiological INP, only exceeded by feldspar. Little is known on the actual contribution of ash to the total aerosol mix over the Amazon Basin. For example, did not infer ash fractions from their mass spectrometer measurements discussed above. Also within MACC, ash is only comprised in the black carbon aerosol. Thus, similar to the consideration of soil dust emissions, biomass burning can also lead to the formation and emission of ash that can enhance ice nucleation efficiency during the dry season.In conclusion, during the dry season, the absolute concentration of soil dust in the vicinity to biomass burning areas can be considered to be 4–5 times higher than during the wet season. Also, the fraction of coarse-mode aerosol, which likely stems from biological emissions, is enhanced in this region. In regions farther away from biomass burning activities, the soil dust fraction as well as the coarse-mode fraction, i.e., primary biological emissions, observed during the wet season, are lower compared to the dry season. Nevertheless, the observations and MACC reanalysis show that during the dry season both fractions of organic material and of mineral dust increase considerably at all tropospheric height levels. It was in addition reported by that frequently deep-convective activity caused transport of the biomass burning aerosol into the free troposphere. With increased concentration of organic matter, dust, and ashes, the dry season is likely to provide populations of more efficient ice nuclei besides black carbon. Due to missing emission schemes for these by-products of biomass burning, it remains, however, unknown to what extent fire-induced soil dust and ash injection can influence the aerosol conditions at cloud-forming height levels.In the present study the seasonal variability of heterogeneous ice production in thin, stratiform cloud layers with lidar-detectable cloud tops over the Amazon Basin was investigated based on a unique interseasonal continuous polarization lidar data set obtained near Manaus, Brazil. Thin stratiform cloud layers are best suited for studies of primary heterogeneous ice formation in relationship to temperature and aerosol properties because secondary ice formation and ice multiplication processes are inefficient in such clouds. It is also noteworthy that heterogeneous ice formation at T >− 25 ∘ C was found to occur only via the liquid phase. Thus, potential seasonal differences in the humidity profiles, which could affect the ice supersaturation and, consequently, the efficiency of deposition or condensation freezing nucleation, cannot explain differences in ice nucleation efficiency at T >− 25 ∘ C.From the Manaus cloud data set, it was found that at all temperatures between 0 and −40 ∘ C, ice formed considerably more frequent during the dry season than during the wet season. Differences in the aerosol conditions between both seasons were found as well. During the dry season, the aerosol backscatter coefficient at 532 nm wavelength exceeds the respective wet-season values by a factor of 2 to 10 at all heights between 4 and 10 km. According to MACC reanalysis data, carbon emissions contribute mostly to the enhanced aerosol load observed during the dry season. Thus, based on the data sets analyzed in this study and implying that the heterogeneous ice formation at T >− 25 ∘ C is determined by temperature and aerosol load only, biomass burning activities are the outstanding driver of the observed enhanced freezing efficiency in the dry season, even though it is not clear which constituent of the biomass burning aerosol leads to the enhanced ice nucleation efficiency. Solely, the increased presence of black carbon particles, which are known to be rather inefficient ice nuclei, cannot explain the observed freezing efficiency. Observations suggest that the emitted biomass burning aerosol contains in addition fractions of soil dust, combustion ashes, or unmodified pristine organic compounds, such as pollen, bacteria, spores, or organic molecules, which are considered to produce ice much more efficient than pure black carbon particles.A more thorough investigation of the seasonal difference in the efficiency of ice nucleation in the Amazon Basin by means of in situ observations at cloud level will be required to evaluate the fraction of mineral dust and ice-nucleation-efficient organic compounds of the smoke plumes and to quantify the actual effect of changes in the aerosol properties on heterogeneous freezing efficiency."
38,dust aerosol ocean,"Tracking the Saharan Air Layer with shipborne lidar across the tropical Atlantic. Saharan dust was observed with shipborne lidar from 60 degrees to 20 degrees W along 14.5 degrees N during a 1-month transatlantic cruise of the research vessel Meteor. About 4500 km off the coast of Africa, mean extinction and backscatter-related angstrom ngstrom exponent of 0.1, wavelength-independent extinction-to-backscatter ratios lidar ratios of around 45 sr, and particle linear depolarization ratio of 20% were found for aged dust transport time >10 days . In contrast, dust with a shorter atmospheric residence time of 2-3 days showed angstrom ngstrom exponents of -0.5 backscatter coefficient and 0.1 extinction coefficient , mean lidar ratios of 64 and 50 sr, and particle linear depolarization ratios of 22 and 26% at 355 and 532nm wavelength, respectively. Traces of fire smoke were also detected in the observed dust layers. The lidar observations were complemented by Aerosol Robotic Network handheld Sun photometer measurements, which revealed a mean total atmospheric column aerosol optical thickness of 0.05 for pure marine conditions in the absence of lofted aerosol layers and roughly 0.9 during a strong Saharan dust outbreak. The achieved data set was compared with first Consortium for Small Scale Modeling-Multi-Scale Chemistry Aerosol Transport simulations. The simulated vertical aerosol distribution showed good agreement with the lidar observations.

The dust emission, transport, and deposition of five independent aerosol size classes between 0.1 and 25 μm radius are modeled with MUSCAT based on the meteorological information of COSMO. The vertical grid has 40 layers from the surface to the tropopause with a first-layer depth of about 68 m. The final simulation results offer a suitable tool for a detailed dust source apportionment.From 29 April to 23 May 2013 aerosol observations with lidar and Sun photometer were performed aboard the R/V reported the same feature for a series of Saharan dust observations at Thessaloniki, Greece. Backscatter-related Ångström exponent of −0.9 were presented by Murayama and Sekiguchi for an Asian dust layer. In a simulation study, T-Matrix code calculations of spheroids and a lognormal particle size distribution from 0.5 to 4.1 μm reproduced this wavelength dependence, without a wavelength-dependent complex refractive index. If this simulation approach is suitable for dust emissions from the Aoukar region needs to be further analyzed under consideration of a larger range for the dust particle size distribution, dust mixtures, and irregularly shaped dust particles.It becomes increasingly obvious that smoke has to be considered to always be part in dust plumes during the whole burning season. This finding can not be clearly obtained from traditional measurements e.g., Sun photometer, Ångström exponent ≈0.1 , but from lidar backscatter, lidar ratio, and δ P .Recent shipborne lidar measurements across the tropical Atlantic along the main route of Saharan dust long-range transport toward America were used to show the optical properties of almost fresh and aged dust layers. Significant differences in the dust optical properties in the discussed two dust plumes were found and may result from aging effects. The reason for these changes with transport need to be analyzed in comprehensive data analysis on day-by-day basis. First COSMO-MUSCAT simulations of the measurements showed a good agreement in the temporal process of the vertical dust distribution. Within the simulations a maximal dust concentration of 150 μg m −3 was calculated. The day-by-day lidar data analysis will be used for further model comparisons with COSMO-MUSCAT and others, which will offer the estimation of the aerosol radiative effect as well."
39,dust particles aerosol ocean,"Source apportionment of aerosol iron in the marine environment using iron isotope analysis. Iron Fe is a critical nutrient for phytoplankton. In the open ocean, this demand coupled with scarce supply often makes Fe the limiting factor in phytoplankton growth. The largest source, by mass, of Fe to the open ocean is windblown soil dust, but this Fe is much less soluble than Fe from other aerosol sources. Therefore, to fully understand how Fe reaches this ecosystem, it is necessary to understand the range of sources of aerosol Fe. To do this, we collected size-segregated aerosol samples from Bermuda and analyzed them to determine their Fe isotope composition. From this analysis, we found clear evidence in the fine size fraction < 2.5 mu m of an important non-soil-dust Fe source. Our isotope analysis of multiple oil and coal fly ashes shows that those materials cannot explain our finding. We suggest biomass burning as the most likely source. , but their productivity is limited in a quarter of the global ocean by the scarcity of Fe, an essential nutrient. These regions of limited productivity, known as high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll areas HNLC , are characterized by high concentrations of macronutrients, such as nitrate and phosphate, but low levels of chlorophyll, a proxy for photosynthetic activity. Much of the Fe that is available in HNLC areas is dissolved from windblown dust. Because of the dominance of aeolian transport, understanding and quantifying the sources of aerosol Fe are very important to our ability to model primary productivity in the ocean and the consequent drawdown of atmospheric CO 2 .. However, recent studies show that Fe in soil dust is < 1% soluble. This allows for the possibility that sources of highly soluble Fe some sources have > 80% soluble Fe , while less massive, may contribute significantly to the supply of bioavailable Fe in the open ocean. Of particular interest is the idea that anthropogenic aerosol particles, such as combustion byproducts and other industrial pollution, and biomass burning aerosols contribute substantially to the growth of marine phytoplankton. In order to explore this possibility, a proxy measurement for non-soil-dust aerosol Fe is needed. Previous work by our research group demonstrated that Fe isotope analysis can expose some differences in aerosol sources to terrestrial environments. Therefore, Fe isotope composition has the potential to serve as this proxy in marine aerosols.. By using size-segregated aerosol sampling, the ubiquitous soil dust signal can be partially separated from other material, improving our ability to detect small isotopic shifts. In previous work measuring the Fe isotope composition of aerosols, including marine aerosols, little or no variation from average crustal rocks was found. However, none of these studies reported the isotopic composition of different size fractions. By employing size-segregated sampling at the Bermuda site, we sought to maximize our chances of detecting any Fe isotope variations that exist in marine aerosols. Prior to sampling, filters were soaked in 0.5 M HCl all acids trace metal grade, Fisher overnight, rinsed with 18MΩ cm H 2 O, and dried prior to use. They were handled with acid-washed Teflon-coated tweezers throughout. Following sample collection, filters were stored in a freezer at −20°C when not in use.. c . showed that the size distribution of dust was not significantly altered after ~1000 km atmospheric transport, arguing that shattering is not a major occurrence in transport. Thus, while it is reasonable to think that isotopically fractionated precipitates form on aerosol particles in transport, the only way such material could be the source of the light Fe in our study is through shattering, which, though possible, is a low probability event.. Other such materials include rocks with a chemical origin, such as Fe-Mn nodules and some banded Fe formations, but exposures of these rocks are relatively rare and would be unlikely aerosol sources. We did not find a relationship between δ 56 Fe and soluble K + , a common tracer of biomass burning in aerosols. However, Pachon et al . and references therein have questioned the reliability of this approach because K is emitted by other common aerosol sources sea spray, mineral dust in addition to biomass burning. Especially because combustion aerosols are predominantly in the fine fraction, biomass burning seems the most likely source of the light Fe. and Kiczka et al . show differences greater than 1‰ between different plant species. These variations are attributable to a number of factors including differences in Fe uptake strategies and the mineralogy, nutrient content, and maturity of the soil. This research suggests that grasses, because of their minimally fractionating Fe uptake strategy, are unlikely to have light Fe isotope compositions, but argues that all or most nongrass biomass burning should be isotopically light.[28]  This work shows that Fe isotope analysis can provide valuable insight into the sources of Fe in marine aerosols. With the present data set, we have shown that Fe in the coarse fraction is dominantly of crustal origin and does not vary in isotopic composition with season or wind direction. Fe in the fine fraction is of crustal origin only during the Saharan season. In the non-Saharan season, we found that the Fe isotope composition of the fine fraction is variable, which strongly indicates a noncrustal source with a δ 56 Fe < −0.5‰. Because plant matter is the only likely source material known to be isotopically light, biomass burning appears to be the best candidate for this unknown source. Identifying and quantifying this source are an important goal for future research so as to more fully understand the nature of nutrient delivery to the open ocean."
41,climate aerosol atmosphere,"Global analysis of aerosol properties above clouds. The seasonal and spatial variability of Aerosol Above Cloud AAC properties are derived from passive satellite data for the year 2008. A significant amount of aerosols are transported above liquid water clouds on the global scale. For particles in the fine mode i.e., radius smaller than 0.3 mu m , including both clear-sky and AAC, retrievals increase the global mean aerosol optical thickness by 25 6 %. The two main regions of originated anthropogenic AAC are the tropical Southeast Atlantic, for biomass-burning aerosols, and the North Pacific, mainly for pollutants. Man-made AAC are also detected over the Arctic during the spring. Mineral dust particles are detected above clouds within the so-called dust belt region 5-40 degrees N . AAC may cause a warming effect and bias the retrieval of the cloud properties. This study will then help to better quantify the impacts of aerosols on clouds and climate. . Their negative forcing cooling effect may partially compensate for greenhouse gas effects. However, the radiative forcing due to both direct and indirect effects remains a large source of uncertainty. On the positive side, continuous global satellite observations provide reliable information about aerosol distributions and microphysical properties that can be used to improve radiative forcing estimates. Under some circumstances e.g., over ocean , space-based measurements enable the distinction between natural and man-made aerosol signatures as long as they have different aerosols size distributions and that some information on their geographical origin is available. The largest amount of natural aerosols is composed of mineral dust and sea salt, which mostly contribute to the coarse mode whereas man-made aerosols mainly come from urban and industrial pollution, and man-made vegetation fires which are dominated by fine mode particles or accumulation mode . Other aerosols mainly include volcanic dust, pollen, and carbonaceous aerosols from wild vegetation fires.. Overlying absorbing aerosols have a warming effect due to the reduction of the local planetary albedo that is still poorly estimated. In addition to this direct effect, AAC such as biomass-burning aerosols may influence the dynamical evolution of cloud that might lead to a cloud top altitude reduction and a cloud thickening. Moreover, above-cloud aerosols affect the retrieved values of the underlying cloud optical depth and effective radius. There is a lack of global observations about AAC loading and properties due to retrieval methods that are currently limited over space and time. In spite of the ability of a satellite-borne lidar like Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization to detect aerosol and cloud vertical structure, the curtain observations provide limited spatial coverage. Torres et al . and Jethva et al . have proved the ability of passive sensor to detect the presence of an aerosol layer above cloud and to quantify their amount as well as the cloud optical depth for some case studies. Multidirectional polarization measurements have also shown sensitivity to AAC scenes: aerosols generate an additional polarized light at side scattering angles and reduce the polarized signal of the cloud-bow. In light of these observations and thanks to the A-Train, Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances POLDER measurements combined with collocated and simultaneous information about clouds from MODIS paved the way for the development of a retrieval technique of AAC properties on a global scale for a year of data. These results, coupled with the clear-sky product over ocean both fine and coarse mode and over land fine mode only provided by POLDER are analyzed in this study.. The “single-pixel method” allows the retrieval of the Aerosol Optical Thickness AOT above liquid clouds and an aerosol model is chosen from the seven models considered by the algorithm six small spherical models for the fine mode with a complex refractive index of 1.47–0.01 i for both wavelengths and one nonspherical coarse model for dust . The method consists of a comparison between POLDER measurements at 670 and 865 nm and precomputed polarized radiances with a successive order of scattering code.. The cloud optical thickness has to be larger than 3.0 to ensure the saturation of the polarized light scattered by the cloud layer. In order to avoid cirrus contamination, three additional criteria are added. The first one is based on the differences observed between the cloud top pressure provided by both MODIS IR technique, and POLDER Rayleigh and O 2 techniques . Second, the cloud phase index derived following Riedi et al . should not exceed 120, which corresponds to liquid clouds and “mixed-phase” clouds. The last criterion relies on a filter related to the brightness temperature difference between the 8.6 and 11 µm MODIS bands. This filter BTD 8–11  < −1.25 K is introduced since it has shown an ability to distinguish dust from cirrus. The global features displayed in Figure  1 show that the properties of the AAC vary with season and location. AAC retrievals are mainly located over ocean and downwind of continental sources. AAC retrievals with mineral dust particles are associated with the smallest values of AE. Fine mode AAC retrievals are associated with AOTs that mainly range between 0.1 and 0.2, knowing that fresh biomass-burning aerosols are related to AE larger than about 2.0. Values of AE of about 1 indicate regions influenced by both types of particles i.e., mineral dust particles and fine mode particles .. Our results also reveal that the properties of biomass-burning aerosols evolve during their transport above clouds. The mean AE progressively decreases from 2.5 to 1.7, from east to west see Figure  2 , which corresponds to an increase of 0.06 µm for the effective radius in our model database. This suggests that the mean size of the biomass-burning aerosols increases as they progressively move away from the South African coast and age. The transport of African biomass-burning aerosols above clouds over the Atlantic is also frequent during Autumn. A thick plume AOT > 0.15 is observed crossing the South Atlantic, and almost reaching Brazil. The method also detects biomass-burning AAC events over southeast Africa and the Indian Ocean, near the coasts of South Africa and southeastern Mozambique. These AAC occurences are observed in late August and increase in September and October, as the crop clearing fire season in Southern Africa progressively shifts from north to south. The AOT and AE maps also clearly show that biomass-burning aerosols originating from southern Africa can be transported above clouds across the Indian Ocean over large distance as noted in earlier studies. These biomass-burning aerosols are transported east due to the prevailing wind in this region and reach Australia.Ångström exponent retrieved above clouds by POLDER/PARASOL in the South Atlantic Ocean near South Africa. Mean values computed over 3 months June, July, and August 2008 .. The pollution aerosols originate from the Asian megalopolis, whereas the mineral dust particles originate from Mongolia and northeastern China deserts. Fresh biomass-burning aerosols AE > 2.0 are also detected over the Okhotsk Sea, near the Siberian coast for the Spring and Summer. These aerosols are emitted by wild fires that frequently occur over eastern Siberia. Our results indicate that these biomass-burning aerosols are also transported above clouds over the western North Pacific Ocean and are likely to contribute to the transpacific outflow., which is consistent with our results. Our daily result also exhibit large AE values >2.0 over this region, which indicates that biomass-burning aerosols are transported above clouds over the Arctic. Airbone measurements have shown that European air masses with biomass-burning aerosols and Asian air masses with contributions from both biomass-burning aerosols and pollution particles with soot-like inclusion were transported to the pole during Spring 2008. Sometimes the method also detected mineral dust AAC events over the Arctic in spring, and our results indicate that various types of aerosols that originated from eastern Asia i.e., mineral dust and fine mode aerosols contribute to the arctic haze.. Biomass-burning AAC events are detected over a small area located over the southeast Asia mainly over Vietnam and southern China during the spring. These AAC events are related to man-made crop fires. Some biomass-burning AAC events were also detected along the coast of Califonia in June and July see the AE maps for the Summer, AE > 2.0 originating from local vegetation wild fires that occurred in California during the summer 2008. These events however do not result in a strong signal in our seasonal mean AOT. The AE maps reveal four main regions with mineral dust above clouds: the tropical North East Atlantic region close to the Sahara, the Arabian sea, the southeastern part of the horn of Africa mostly Ethiopia and Somalia , and the southeastern part of Asia. To a lesser extent, AAC events with mineral dust particles are also detected over northern Iran during the spring period and near the west coast of Australia during the boreal winter period. Mineral dust AAC is associated with a small number of events and large mean values of AOT see Table  1 . The transport of mineral dust particles above clouds is frequent over the south and east parts of Asia, throughout the year, with a maximum in spring. The other regions mainly show AAC events for the summer period. The transport of Saharan mineral dust is frequent across the Atlantic Ocean, and mineral dust particles are often transported above low-level clouds near the coasts of North Africa. Our methodology detects a large mineral dust plume extending over the tropical North East Atlantic between the African coast 12–14° in latitudes and the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The method retrieves mean AOT values between 0.3 and 0.9, with the maximal mean AOT retrieved near the coast of Mauritania. The main source areas for the Arabian Sea region could be the surrounding deserts located in Oman and in the Arabian Peninsula, whereas the mineral dust AAC observed over the horn of Africa could be originating from local sources previously detected in Ethiopia and Somalia. The analysis detects a dust plume over the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean during the winter period; AAC events with mineral dust particles are also detected along the northeastern coast of the USA AE of about 1.0 for the summer and spring periods and over the Gulf of Mexico for the spring period. We assume that these particles were transported from North Africa since the longe range transport of Saharan dust is frequent over the North Atlantic Ocean.. Our results indicate that a significant amount of such particles are transported above clouds in various regions of the world, including the North Pole during the Spring which was not expected. As previously mentioned, imager retrieved cloud property biases primarily optical thickness and derived water path are also expected when biomass-burning aerosols and mineral dust particles are present above clouds, and precautions should be therefore taken when analyzing cloud retrievals in regions where such AAC events are now identified. Another interesting point is the fact that our method does not retrieve significant AOT over clouds in cloudy region located far away from continental sources, such as the Antarctic Ocean, as it might be expected. The use of a limited number of aerosol models and the lack of sensitivity to mineral dust particles, when the aerosol optical thicknesses above clouds become small, are two limitations that could be overcome by using a more sophisticated retrieval method. We also note that our method is currently restricted to AAC scenes with cloud optical thickness larger than 3.0 and homogeneous liquid water clouds. The results presented in this study therefore might still underestimate slightly the total number of AAC events. However, the above-cloud direct aerosol radiative effect increases with cloud optical thickness, so that AAC events identified in this study are the most important for estimating the radiative effect on a global scale."
40,dust climate aerosol,"A sub-basin scale dust plume source frequency inventory for southern Africa, 2005-2008. We present a dust plume source inventory for southern Africa. In order to locate and track the local, short-lived plume events, source and frequency data have been derived from Meteosat Second Generation MSG thermal infrared composite data 4km data using 8.7, 10.8, and 12.0 mu m and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS visible composite data 0.25km data utilizing 0.620 - 0.670 mu m, 0.545 - 0.565 mu m, and 0.459 - 0.479 mu m . Between January 2005 and December 2008, a total of 328 distinct daytime dust plumes more than 10km in length were detected. These plumes were attributed to 101 distinct point sources, consisting largely of ephemeral inland lakes, coastal pans as well as dry river valleys in Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. These data also provided sub-basin scale source observations for large basins such as Etosha and Makgadikgadi Pans.  through interaction with biogeochemical cycles, and direct and indirect radiative forcing of the atmosphere. The relative impact of dust in the Earth's system depends on characteristics such as particle size, shape, and mineralogy. Whilst these characteristics can change during dust transport, they are initially determined by the terrestrial sources from which particles are entrained. Our principal means of predicting the impacts of dust emission on future weather and climate are through the use of numerical models. have produced dust maps which emphasize aerosol dispersion, rather than explicit dust origin. Engelstaedter and Washington made a significant advance on the foundational TOMS-based studies by Prospero et al . and Washington et al . by adding surface gustiness in their global analyses. The Engelstaedter and Washington study established 131 global hotspots, six of which were in southern Africa, most of which due to the coarse resolution remained largely unspecified domains with limited geomorphological understanding of sources. Even with higher resolution products, Ginoux et al ., who presented a synthesis of global-scale high-resolution 0.1° dust source locations based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS Deep Blue aerosol measurements, still did not improve upon the specifications of southern African sources. It is clear that inherent seasonal and diurnal dust emission variations along with the spatial heterogeneity of dust sources in global and mesoscale models are poorly constrained due to inexact source allocation and quantification. Regional observations utilizing higher-temporal and spatial resolution data have been more successful in deriving information pertaining to the dust sources and activation frequency. For example, studies using Meteosat Second Generation MSG -SEVIRI Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager in northern Africa point toward a series of approaches that may be taken to match remote sensing data of dust events or more generally “dustiness” to the temporal signature of metrological emission drivers. Outside of the Sahara dust belt, very few inventories of dust sources at the sub-basin scale exist. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the detection of spatially discrete and intermittent sources can be undertaken using moderate resolution polar-orbiting data, e.g., SeaWiFS Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor , MODIS, and a combination of GOES Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite and MODIS.. Nevertheless, SAFARI-92 and SAFARI 2000 established a greater understanding of both air-transport patterns and the temporal variability of regional aerosols. These initiatives identified that; aerosol loads peak during August and September, include a component of aeolian dust, and coincide with the period of significant biomass burning. The main sources of the regional mineral aerosol load are from the Etosha Pans in Namibia and the Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana. These two ephemeral lake basins are amongst the southern hemisphere's most significant dust sources. The aim of this study is to provide the first unified, subcontinental, and detailed dust plume source location inventory for southern Africa, using a combination of MSG-SEVIRI and MODIS data.. In order to detect spatially and temporally discrete dust events i.e., plumes using remote sensing data, it is clear one has to take account of: i the varying performance of dust detection algorithms with variable dust thickness, height, and mineralogy ii lags that may exist between the timing of satellite overpass and dust plume emission, iii cloud and water vapor effects, and iv subjectivity in identifying events and pinpointing dust storm emission locations. To overcome some of these issues, combined use of remote sensing data providing high spatial resolution and high sample frequency was considered. We use a similar multisensor approach to Lee et al . and Rivera Rivera et al . by combining MODIS visible composite data utilizing 0.620 – 0.670 µm, 0.545 – 0.565 µm, and 0.459 – 0.479 µm at 0.25 km derived from NASA Terra and Aqua platforms. Terra ~08:30 GMT and Aqua ~13:30 GMT orbits provided images with a nadir resolution of 0.25 km representing morning and afternoon conditions. This was combined with data from the SEVIRI instrument on-board the MSG satellite utilizing the Brightness Temperature Difference BTD product using the 8.7 µm, 10.8 µm, and 12 µm channels at 4 km resolution. Three daily images representing morning 07:00 GMT , noon 10:00 GMT , and afternoon 13:00 GMT were extracted. Ackerman and Baddock et al . provided a comprehensive review of dust detection in the visible and infrared wavelengths also used here, while Schepanski et al . and Brindley et al . provided a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of MSG-SEVIRI BTD algorithm for dust detection. Dust plumes occurring underneath clouds were unlikely to be detected. Between 2005 and 2008, the multisensor approach detected 328 dust plumes greater than 10 km in length Table  1 . On average, our plumes measured only 96 km and even the longest plumes were only around 400 km long, which generally remained well defined, local in extent, and short lived in nature, lasting for a few hours at most. This along with their limited dispersion pattern made source identification relatively easy. We were therefore able to attribute these plumes to 101 source locations Supporting Table S1 from five principle source regions Figure  2 and Supporting Figure  S2 which can be ranked by dust plume counts per source as follows: 1 The Makgadikgadi Pan Botswana produced 53 distinct plumes on 31 days originating from four ephemeral sub-basins in northern and southern Sua and Ntwetwe Pans. 2 The Etosha Pan region Namibia generated 32 dust plumes on 22 days with dominant emissive clusters in the western and eastern sub-basin. 3 The 1500 km long Namibian coastline Namibia emitted 203 plumes on 39 days from 70 unique plume sources including pans sabkhas and playas , ephemeral rivers, wetlands, and possibly a mine. 4 In addition, the 300 km long, south-western Kalahari Pan Belt South Africa and Namibia , hosted 37 events on 9 days from 24 pans and two associated drainage lines Figure  1 a . 5 The pans of the Free State South Africa only yielded three plumes on three separate days from two distinct sources with agriculture possibly also being a contributing factor.Pans dominate in terms of sources count 57% and number of detectable plumes 64% . The Makgadikgadi Pan Complex accounts for 16% of all detectable plumes, which do originate from several clusters in the Sua and Ntwetwe sub-basins. The Namib Desert hosts 70 of the 101 sources producing 62% of all detectable plumes. Ephemeral rivers accounted for more than half of all plume sources in this region.Onanzi Pan was active beyond the main shore of the Etosha Pan and was counted separately.This marsh represents the interdune oasis in the Lower Hoanib River.This source is located near the Orange River mouth and could be the result of mining.Southern African dust plume source locations. Plume frequency and timing for the various regions: a Etosha Basin, b Makgadikgadi Basin, c Namib Coastal Sources, d South Western Kalahari Sources, e Free State Sources. Circles indicate the weighted frequency of the number of dust plumes, clearly indicating the dominance of the Makgadikgadi and Etosha Pans in detected plume frequency. Sub-basin clusters can be identified in Auxiliary Figure  1 . Rivers and Pans along the Namibian coastline contribute to multiple detected plumes during the 4 year period. The bar charts represent the number of days on which each region had detected dust plumes. The Etosha basin peaks in June and August, the Makgadkgadi in August, the Free State was only seen to emit in December, while the South Western Kalahari peaked in September, and the Namibian coastline in June and August.. While confirming the magnitude of Etosha and Makgadikgadi pans, this study for the first time identifies persistent sub-basin clusters of sources which are responsible for emissions within these large pans. Furthermore, observations here not only extend the dust plume record for Namib sources, 1972–1995 Space Shuttle photography in Eckardt et al . 2001 and 1998–2001 from SeaWiFS in Eckardt and Kuring but also add 39 previously unidentified source points to the inventory. The Kuiseb River was first identified as highly productive in Eckardt and Kuring , an observation we can now confirm with the Kuiseb accounting for 20% of all Namibian River plumes seen here. Vickery and Eckardt have recently examined the controls which could make this the dustiest river in southern Africa. Our observations also captured active pans in the south-western Kalahari; a region tentatively flagged in an earlier TOMS product with Hakskeenpan in South Africa being its largest and most productive source 6 plumes . Despite the vast number of pans in the Karoo and Free State, and known dust events having been observed at ground level, this region produced only a few detectable plumes in our imagery for the observation period. Table  1 . The multisensor approach used here has identified large and small pans, some of which are only a few km 2 in size, as the most prolific regional sources of plumes 57% , with the remaining attributed to rivers and wetlands including the Hoanib Oasis. This trend was consistent across data types, with MSG also resulting in the attribution of ~50% of all sources as pans; accounting for 52 of the 65 events which is more than elsewhere Chihuahuan Desert Pans, 30%; LEB, 11%; and Sahara, 3% . Clearly, different land surfaces play different roles in the dust cycle across regions, which has further implications for the appropriate treatment of dust sources within global models. and Bryant et al .. The Namibian coastal sources are active from April to September, seemingly driven by favorable winter Bergwinds which occur slightly earlier in the year.. There was relatively close agreement between the two products for Makgadikgadi and Etosha pans, with coincidental plumes on both data sets. Coincidental detection Supporting Figure  S1 and Supporting Table S1 was limited by the retrieval of MSG data on local servers Supporting Figure  S2 . The current development of improved algorithms to enhance the weak, transient dust signals in SEVIRI false color imagery forms the basis of ongoing research in this region which should improve event retrievals in future., to six in Washington et al . and more recently 10 sources by Ginoux et al .. This demonstrated that combined use of visually interpreted MODIS and MSG-SEVIRI data can build significantly upon prior dust observations using global TOMS, OMI and MODIS products. Our plume observations have identified sub-basin scale source clusters for the Etosha and Makgadikgadi Pans and have for the first time detected active plumes in the south western Kalahari pan belt. We can also report that more than half of all the plumes detected in southern Africa originate from pans. This figure is considerably higher than for any other previously interrogated source regions e.g., Chihuahuan Desert, LEB, Sahara . The multitemporal observations for southern Africa also show that dust plumes are most active before noon in all source regions. Such detailed observations are crucial in guiding ground-based observations seeking to investigate controls on emission due to surface characteristics and sediment supply dynamics, as well as to inform a range of modelling activities. Our findings here have already guided field monitoring to emissive locations at the Makgadikgadi Pans that no single remote sensing product is currently able to provide a systematic dust source map which can pinpoint plume origin to within a few km at a continental or regional scale; and that a synergistic approach to remote sensing data and algorithm use is often appropriate. Further improvements to methods and retrieval approaches to aid dust source detection and characterization using both MSG-SEVIRI and MODIS form the basis of ongoing research. In general point sources, even small playas were readily identifiable in the 250 m resolution true color MODIS imagery and source attribution in MSG was more difficult if there were no coincidental plumes with MODIS. It appears that MODIS true color plumes may well be younger and lower and that MSG is better at detecting aged, elevated, and cooler plumes."
42,climate aerosol ocean,"Natural aerosol-climate feedbacks suppressed by anthropogenic aerosol. The natural environment is an important source of atmospheric aerosol such as dust, sea spray, and wildfire smoke. Climate controls many of these natural aerosol sources, which, in turn, can alter climate through changing the properties of clouds and the Earth's radiative balance. However, the Earth's atmosphere is now heavily modified by anthropogenic pollution aerosol, but how this pollution may alter these natural aerosol-climate feedbacks has not been previously explored. Here we use a global aerosol microphysics model to analyze how anthropogenic aerosol alters one link within these feedbacks, namely, the sensitivity of cloud albedo to changes in natural aerosol. We demonstrate that anthropogenic aerosol in the Northern Hemisphere has halved the hemispheric mean cloud albedo radiative effect that occurs due to changes in natural aerosol emissions. Such a suppression has not occurred in the more pristine Southern Hemisphere. . A key mechanism is through the emissions of natural aerosol to the atmosphere impacting climate through scattering and absorbing radiation and altering the properties of clouds. Since many natural aerosol sources are themselves driven by climate, there is the potential for important climate feedbacks. Best known of these natural aerosol–climate feedbacks is the CLAW hypothesis, whereby climate change alters the emissions of dimethyl sulfide DMS from oceanic phytoplankton, modifying the amount of sulfate aerosol in the atmosphere, leading to changes in cloud reflectivity and, hence, climate. While recent work has questioned the strength of the CLAW climate feedback, many other natural aerosol–climate feedbacks are possible. For example, a warmer climate may increase the prevalence of wildfires, resulting in increased wildfire aerosol which may then impact climate. Warmer temperatures may also result in increased emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds BVOCs from vegetation, resulting in increased secondary organic aerosol SOA with potential impacts on climate. This feedback mechanism between forests, emissions of BVOCs, formation of SOA, and climate was proposed by Kulmala et al . and has been recently explored through analysis of long-term observations of BVOCs and the number concentrations of aerosol particles. which have greatly altered aerosol concentrations across the globe. Because the impacts of aerosol on climate are nonlinear, especially aerosol indirect effects AIEs which operate through clouds, it is likely that natural aerosol–climate feedbacks have changed greatly since the preindustrial period. which is an extension of the TOMCAT global 3-D chemical transport model. The model is forced by analyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF . We used a horizontal resolution of 2.8° × 2.8° and 31 vertical levels between the surface and 10 hPa. We used the model to simulate the impact of changes in climatically driven natural aerosol sources both in a preindustrial PI and a present-day PD atmosphere. To isolate the impact of changing anthropogenic aerosol emissions between the two periods, we used the same meteorology for all simulations which we apply for the year 2000. demonstrated that this modal version of GLOMAP simulates very similar aerosol compared to the sectional version of the same model. GLOMAP includes representations of nucleation, particle growth via coagulation, condensation and cloud processing, wet and dry deposition, and in/below cloud scavenging. We used an identical model setup to that described in detail in Mann et al .. GLOMAP has been previously evaluated against observations of aerosol number concentration, aerosol number size distribution, and composition-resolved aerosol mass. Of particular importance for this study is the ability of the model to simulate observed concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei CCN and cloud droplet number. Mann et al . compared the model against an extensive data set of CCN observations synthesized by Spracklen et al .. The normalized mean bias between model and observations was 12%, which is less than the stated observational error. The model has been also evaluated against observed cloud droplet number concentrations CDNCs .. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions have increased greatly over this period, with anthropogenic sulfur emissions increasing from 0.1 Tg yr −1 in 1750 to 108.5 Tg yr −1 in 2000. Our simulated global aerosol burden excluding dust increased from 11.0 mg m −2 in the PI to 13.6 mg m −2 in the PD. This increase 2.6 mg m −2 matches previous studies that have been reported by the AeroCom multimodel exercise 3.7 ± 0.9 mg m −2 . Natural aerosol emissions are as described in Dentener et al . and implemented in the model according to Mann et al .. Here we describe natural emissions that are of particular importance to this work. DMS emissions are calculated online in the model using ECMWF wind speeds in combination with the sea-air exchange parameterization from Nightingale et al . and monthly seawater DMS concentration fields from Kettle and Andreae . Wildfire emissions are from van der Werf et al .. Monoterpene emissions are taken from Guenther et al .. SOA is generated from the first-step oxidation of monoterpenes, with a fixed molar yield of 13%. Our treatment of SOA has been previously described in detail. and simulated 25%, 50%, and 100% increases in emissions from these sources. The different sources are driven by diverse climatic factors. Nevertheless, the increases we simulate are within the range of previous estimates of the impact of the 2000–2100 climate change on natural aerosol emissions.. While this metric does not capture the full range of aerosol-cloud interactions, it is widely used to estimate the impact of aerosols on clouds and climate. We calculated CDNCs using the aerosol size distribution simulated by GLOMAP-mode and a mechanistic parameterization of cloud drop formation for a cloud updraft velocity of 0.2 m s −1 . We then used a radiative transfer model and a methodology described in previous studies to calculate the impact of the changes in CDNC on cloud albedo and radiative balance. The radiative transfer model has six bands in the SW and nine bands in the LW, with a delta-Eddington 2 stream scattering solver at all wavelengths. We employed a monthly mean climatology for water vapor, temperature, and ozone based on ECMWF reanalysis data, together with surface albedo and cloud fields from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project D2 for the year 2000..Cloud droplet number concentrations CDNCs in a preindustrial PI and b present day PD . The fractional change in CDNC caused by a 100% increase in climatically driven natural aerosol sources in c PI and d PD., so the CDNC in polluted regions is less sensitive to changes in natural emissions compared to pristine regions. This relationship between aerosol number concentration and CDNC has been carefully evaluated in our model, giving us confidence that the response is well captured. Figure  2 b shows the first aerosol indirect effect due changes in natural aerosol sources in both the PD and PI atmospheres. In the PI atmosphere, doubling of natural aerosol sources results in a NH mean radiative effect of −0.51 W m −2 . In the PD atmosphere, the same increase in natural emissions results in a cooling effect which is a factor 2 smaller −0.24 W m −2 . In the more pristine SH, the same fractional increases in natural aerosol emissions result in a hemispheric mean radiative effect of −0.65 W m −2 in the PI and −0.58 W m −2 in the PD. It is well known that pristine clouds are more susceptible to changing aerosol compared to polluted clouds due to the nonlinear response of CDNC to changing aerosol and because cloud albedo responds to fractional rather than absolute changes in CDNC. Our results suggest that anthropogenic pollution aerosol is resulting in a substantial suppression of the sensitivity of cloud albedo to changing natural aerosol emissions across the Northern Hemisphere. This suppression has been recently observed at polluted locations but has never been demonstrated at the global scale. Our results have implications for our understanding of the role of natural aerosol in climate change. We find that cloud albedo is more sensitive to changing natural aerosol emissions in the SH. Observed natural aerosol–climate feedbacks are likely to have been more important in the prehuman atmosphere, before anthropogenic aerosol pollution., our study indicates that interactions between natural aerosol and climate are likely to be weaker in today's polluted atmosphere than would have been the case before anthropogenic aerosol pollution. Our study may have implications for the role of other natural aerosol processes in climate. For example, interactions between cosmic rays, aerosol, clouds, and climate which have been quantified as weak in today's atmosphere may have also been more important prior to anthropogenic aerosol pollution. The reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions that are predicted over the next few decades may help to restore the role of natural aerosol–climate feedbacks in controlling future climate. Here we have used a global aerosol microphysics model to study one link within potential natural aerosol–climate feedbacks. Future studies need to explore the entire feedback cycle within fully coupled Earth system models."
43,climate,"Impact of known local and tropical volcanic eruptions of the past millennium on the WAIS Divide microparticle record. We present a new method for inferring the relative location low- versus high-southern latitude , and therefore the potential climatic impact, of past eruptions based on the particle size distribution PSD of micrometer-sized ash measured continuously in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet WAIS Divide ice core. We find that particles from a high-southern latitude eruption Buckle Island, Antarctica 1839 Common Era, C.E. have a PSD with mode diameter 5 mu m coarser than the background dust mode 5.1 mu m , while ash particles originating from stratospheric tropical eruptions, including Tambora 1815 C.E. , Kuwae 1458 C.E. , and Unknown 1258 C.E. , have PSDs with mode diameters similar to 0.6-1.5 mu m finer than the background. In addition, volcanic ash particles from global-scale eruptions are deposited similar to 3-6 months earlier and over a shorter time interval than sulfate aerosols. We hypothesize that this phasing is driven by differences in atmospheric processing and aerosol/particle transport and deposition. . By emitting fine ash particles and sulfur dioxide gas SO 2 to the stratosphere, which rapidly oxidizes to sulfate aerosol SO 4 2- , large eruptions decrease the amount of shortwave radiation reaching Earth's surface, cooling the troposphere while warming the stratosphere. Tropical eruptions that inject ash and sulfate above the tropopause have the greatest potential to impact global climate, as the atmospheric circulation allows dispersion of sulfate aerosols to both polar hemispheres. Volcanic plumes that are erupted below the tropopause have smaller climatic impacts; however, deep atmospheric convection and proximity to the stratosphere are capable of lofting aerosols even from relatively modest volcanic eruptions into the stratosphere, thereby increasing their potential impact on climate. In contrast, eruptions that occur at higher latitudes tend to have only local or regional effects on climate or biogeochemistry.. Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica provide direct evidence, in the form of acidity peaks and tephra layers, of past volcanic events at high temporal resolution and over long time spans 10 1 –10 5 years . These records of past volcanism serve as chronostratigraphic markers that are used to correlate different ice cores and to estimate the climatic impacts of past eruptions. Because local- and global-scale eruptions have very different climate impacts, it is important to distinguish them in the ice core record; however, differentiating them can be complicated. There are a number of eruptions of unknown origin that were first observed in polar ice core records two decades ago. Determining the approximate magnitude and latitude of these eruptions is an important step toward estimating their potential impact on past climate. Geochemical fingerprinting of tephra layers in ice cores can allow the positive identification of the source volcano, provided that a geochemical and temporal match is found. However, ash particles of sufficient size and quantity for geochemical fingerprinting from low-latitude eruptions rarely occur in polar ice cores. Without sufficient tephra volume for robust geochemical analysis, linking an ice core tephra layer to a source eruption can be challenging; thus, past radiative forcing estimates include this large uncertainty. and are consistent with other methods of identifying stratospheric eruptions. Our microparticle and conductivity records are further used to characterize depositional phasing between chemical aerosol and particulate components of stratospheric eruptions. Finally, we apply our interpretations to the unknown eruption of 1258 Common Era C.E. , one of several late thirteenth century eruptions implicated in initiating or intensifying the Little Ice Age climate interval through changes in radiative forcing and sea ice feedbacks. We suggest that our results may be used in the future to characterize additional eruptions of unknown origin, thereby estimating their potential contribution to climate forcing., sufficient for detection of well-preserved annual layers. We melted the upper 577 m of the deep ice core, WDC06A, using a continuous ice core melter system. Prior to melting, core ends and breaks were mechanically scraped using a clean ceramic blade to reduce potential contamination from drilling fluid and other sources. The ice core meltwater was analyzed continuously for microparticles using a flow-through Klotz Abakus laser particle detector, and for electrolytic conductivity using a flow-through conductivity cell Amber Science . Because volcanic sulfate deposition is accompanied by increased H + , we record volcanic signals as increased total conductivity of the meltwater. Depth coregistration for both data sets was achieved using a weight and rotary encoder and our sample-tracking algorithm, giving a depth uncertainty of ±1 mm. The depth resolution achieved by our system is 1.0 cm in glacial ice and ~2 cm in low-density firn, which equates to ~10–20 samples/yr for the late Holocene core analyzed here.. Particle size distributions were determined by calculating the total volume of insoluble dust contained within each size bin, assuming spherical dimensions and then taking the derivative of the particle volume with respect to the natural logarithm of the particle diameter for each bin d V/ d ln D in µm 3 mL -1 . We use the mode particle diameter most commonly occurring value as a descriptive statistic for the center of the volume distribution. Because the background atmospheric dust PSDs surrounding each eruption interval were nearly identical, we use the average background PSD, which has a mode diameter of 5.1 µm Figures  1 and 2 c . In addition, we characterized the PSDs of individual, stratigraphically relevant particle concentration peaks in order to determine how the inferred volcanic PSDs differed from the PSDs associated with atmospheric dust peaks supporting information .Electrolytic conductivity and microparticle concentration time series data for the eruptions of a Buckle Island 1839 , b Tambora 1815 , c Kuwae 1458 , and d Unknown 1258 . Yellow-orange bars indicate the time intervals used in the calculation of background PSD black curve in Figure  2 , and other colored bars indicate the time intervals used in calculating the volcanic PSDs shown in Figure  2 .

The modes indicated for the 1261 and Buckle Island eruptions are both minimum modes, shown for comparison.. Years are defined by high-resolution <1 cm per sample measurements of seasonally varying sulfur, sodium, black carbon, and electrical conductivity; the beginning of each year is defined as 1 January. Calendar ages assigned to our data may be subject to minor changes, as the time scale for the ice core continues to be developed; however, relative sample duration or delay timing will be the same between individual annual layers.. Although the volcanic source of the 1258 event has not yet been published though speculation exists that it was Mt. Rinjani, Indonesia , there is ample evidence of the stratospheric nature and climate-altering impact of this eruption. Therefore, we use these four eruptions as exemplars of the patterns we see for local/tropospheric and tropical/stratospheric eruptions in the WAIS Divide ice core.. The possible signal from this eruption is identified in the WAIS Divide ice core as two discrete pulses of elevated particle concentrations, reaching levels of 2500 and 5300 mL -1 , respectively Figure  1 a; note that the discrepancy in date is within the uncertainty of the time scale . A core break slightly shallower in the core prevents us from assessing whether there may have been additional tephra pulses associated with this eruption. There was no apparent effect on conductivity, which may be due to the separation of sulfate aerosols and ash particles during transport and deposition. The PSD of ash from this eruption is coarser than the background dust Figure  2 a . Because the upper detection limit of the Abakus particle sizing instrument is 15 µm in diameter, we did not capture the full PSD range. However, the mode particle diameter is likely to be >10 µm, significantly larger than the background mode diameter 5.1 µm ., typifies the patterns we observe for deposition of material from tropical eruptions transported via the stratosphere. A discrete pulse of particles was deposited during an interval of 1 year or less, followed several months later by a large conductivity peak, which spans several years Figure  1 b; see also Cole-Dai et al . . The particle concentration peak associated with Tambora reaches 1700 particles mL -1 , only a factor of ~3 above the background dust concentration, and yet the mode diameter 4.0 µm is distinctly finer than the background atmospheric dust 5.1 µm; Figure  2 b . Conductivity rises in two peaks to 0.31 and 0.32 μS cm -1 , respectively, and remains elevated for about 2 years.. The mode diameter is 3.6 µm, substantially finer than the background 5.1 µm; Figure  2 b . Conductivity begins to increase about 6 months after the beginning of particle deposition. It rises from a background of ~0.12 μS cm -1 in two peaks, reaching 0.37 and 0.48 μS cm -1 , respectively, and remains elevated for over 2 years., resulted in similar depositional patterns to those observed for Tambora and Kuwae. Enhanced microparticle deposition in the WAIS Divide ice core occurred in two pulses during the year 1258, reaching 3200 and 2400 particles mL -1 , respectively Figure  1 d . The modal particle diameter was 4.5 µm, which was finer than the background 5.1 µm; Figure  2 b . Approximately 6 months after the onset of ash deposition, conductivity began to increase. The first conductivity peak reached 0.31 μS cm -1 , with a second peak of 0.26 μS cm -1 occurring within 1 year of the first chemical aerosol deposition; conductivity remained elevated for over 2 years. A second large particle concentration peak occurred in 1261, reaching 5000 particles mL -1 . The relative coarseness of particles in this peak suggests a local eruption Figure  2 a .. Given the range of factors that could influence this lag time, including season of eruption and postdepositional effects on the ice sheet surface, we do not attempt to explain the minor differences in observed phasing offsets. Rather, we interpret the consistent occurrence of a lag of sulfate deposition behind particulates as a function of two things: 1 the timeframe of chemical oxidation of volcanic sulfur dioxide to sulfate aerosol and 2 aerosol size and therefore terminal settling velocity and atmospheric lifetime. Sulfate aerosol droplets range in diameter from about 0.1 to 1.0 µm, while the ash particles we found associated with stratospheric eruptions had a mode diameter of around 4 µm. Thus, differences in atmospheric transport, residence time, and deposition likely drive the observed phasing.. Therefore, we believe that our observations reflect the combined effects of volcanic latitude and eruption magnitude. Given the presence of >1500 volcanic layers in the WAIS Divide ice core identified through optical logging and visual stratigraphic analysis N. W. Dunbar, personal communication, 2012; R. C. Bay, personal communication, 2012 —very few of which have been identified to source—our findings represent an important step forward in determining the possible contribution of these eruptions to global climate forcing.[15]  While acidity peaks in polar ice cores have long been used as indicators of global-scale eruptions, ash particles sourced from these eruptions have not consistently been identified. Observations have been limited by a general lack of subannually resolved ice core microparticle records from Greenland and Antarctica. Using the high-resolution WAIS Divide ice core, we are able to measure elevated microparticle concentrations associated with acidity peaks for well-known stratospheric eruptions of the past millennium, as well as a high southern latitude eruption. The accuracy and precision of the WAIS Divide time scale gives us confidence in our attribution of these events; however, quantitative geochemical analysis of ash particles from these four eruptions will be needed to confirm their origin. For the first time, we demonstrate that ash particles from explosive tropical eruptions have finer size distributions than the background atmospheric dust at this site. In addition, we observe that ash particles are deposited roughly 3–6 months prior to the beginning of chemical aerosol i.e., sulfate deposition. We find that a smaller, high southern latitude eruption produced a coarser-than-background PSD, implying the tropospheric transport of its ash cloud. We suggest that these observations can be used to infer the relative latitude and/or magnitude of unknown eruptions as measured in polar ice cores and therefore their potential impact on global climate. Our results illustrate the value of microparticle size distribution measurements and underscore the need for more such records from spatially distributed high-accumulation ice core sites."
45,aerosol,"New stratospheric dust belt due to the Chelyabinsk bolide. The Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite OMPS Limb Profiler LP on the recently launched NASA/NOAA NPP/Suomi satellite detected aerosol excess in the mid-stratosphere 25-45 km altitude between 50 degrees N and 70 degrees N latitudes. OMPS/LP observations trace this aerosol plume to the meteor that struck near Chelyabinsk, Russia on 15 February 2013. This new dust layer, located above the Junge aerosol layer, has persisted over at least a 3 month period. Material collected on the ground following the bolide explosion showed that the meteor was mostly composed of olivine and pyroxenes. Simulations using Lagrangian and Eulerian atmospheric models trace the plume back to Chelyabinsk and confirm that the plume altitude was at altitudes between 25 and 45 km. The models also confirm the plume circumpolar longitudinal spreading observed by OMPS/LP, with propagation speeds up to 85 m/s. . The NPP/Suomi satellite operates in a near-circular, sun-synchronous orbit with a 1:30 P.M. ascending node—making the aerosol retrieval particularly sensitive at high northern latitudes. OMPS/LP retrieved the aerosol extinction with an estimated 30% precision, using wavelengths ranging from 470 to 870 nm. The aerosol extinction parameter is defined as the fractional reduction of sunlight for 1 km path. Information on aerosol particle size distribution is inferred from the spectral dependence of the extinction Angstrom coefficient .. The point of maximum brightness was located at 54.8°N and 61.1°E. According to the observations, most meteoritic dust was loaded on altitudes from 23 to 45 km. A significant fraction of the explosion debris was transported upwards in an air burst mushroom cloud which rose quickly in about 100 s up to 33–35 km, above the Earth's natural Junge aerosol layer. On the ground, meteoritic debris scattered over a large area, and recovered fragments were found to be very small., with particles slowly decreasing in size, from 0.2 micron Angstrom coefficient = 0 down to 0.05 micron Angstrom coefficient = 3 . Its optical depth also very slowly decreased. The belt has a vertical depth of about 5 km, a width of about 300–400 km.Meteor plume eastward progression and formation of the belt. Each OMPS/LP observation corresponds to an orbital overpass, which typically occurs about every 25° longitude. The shape of the belt is tied to the polar vortex as confirmed by the GEOS-5 model simulations. A new dust structure can be seen to form in late March over the North Atlantic region. This second structure is “aerosol bubble” which was splitted from tropical Junge layer.Extinction profiles within the Chelyabinsk meteor dust plume. The extinction spectral dependence is an indicator of particle size: little spectral dependence indicates the presence of large particles such as on 16 February , whereas larger spectral dependence points to smaller particles as in later days .

Figure  4 g shows the photo by microscope. has been employed to track volcanic plumes in both the stratosphere and upper troposphere and to track a stratospheric rocket launch plume that drifted from the Baikonur Cosmodrome to California. The trajectories are driven using the wind and temperatures from NASA's Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications reanalysis. Parcels are initialized in a cylinder extending from 33.5 to 43.5 km which OMPS/LP has identified as the plume's densest part in a circle with a 150 km radius centered on Chelyabinsk at 03:20 UT on 15 February. In the simulation, parcels move rapidly in an east-northeast direction from Chelyabinsk following the explosion. Figure  5 displays the initial location of the parcels the white circle , and the trajectory distributions on 16 February at 3:00 UT, 16 February at 23:00 UT, 18 February at 16:00 UT, and 20 February at 12:00 UT. On 16 February, the cylinder has developed into an elongated structure that tilts eastward with altitude, with the parcels extending considerably eastward of Chelyabinsk. The high-extinction OMPS/LP observations are nearly coincident with the trajectories. The higher-altitude trajectories reached Alaska very late on 16 February and were over Canada on 17 February. On 20 February, the trajectories extended in a long arc from Canada, across the North Atlantic into Europe, and across the Russian Federation. Superimposed on Figure  5 are the OMPS/LP observations that showed large extinction > 1.0 × 10 −6 1/km that were above 31 km peak extinction altitude is colored on the same color scale as the trajectories . The trajectories match these extinction locations quite well errors of less than 300 km horizontally and 3 km vertically over the 5 day period shown on Figure  5 .Trajectories purple coloring originated from a cylinder of parcels that were initialized on 15 February at the location of the Chelyabinsk bolide white circle . Trajectories at the lower altitude darker purple, 33.5 km are on the western edges of the parcel collections, while the trajectories at the higher altitude red, 43.5 km are on the eastern edges. The OMPS/LP profiles with extinctions greater than 1.0 × 10 −6 are indicated by the colored circles higher altitudes in red and lower altitudes in purple as with the trajectories .. GEOS-5 contains components for atmospheric circulation and composition including atmospheric data assimilation , with aerosol processes derived from the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport model. The near real-time version of GEOS-5 used for the bolide dust simulations runs on a global 25 km cubed sphere grid with 72 vertical levels having the model top at 0.01 hPa ~80 km and is informed by the full tropospheric and stratospheric meteorological data assimilation. We have customized the dust component of GEOS-5 for simulating the meteoric dust plume by adjusting the size range of the five dust bins to accommodate submicron particles with central radius at 0.06, 0.11, 0.22, 0.44, and 0.89 µm. The five dust tracers run coupled to the GEOS-5 radiation parameterization and are subject to the standard GEOS-5 dust processes: advection, diffusion, convective transport, dry/wet deposition, and sedimentation. The initial dust mass distribution on 3:20 UT 15 February 2013 are prescribed based on a parametric model centered on Chelyabinsk with initial mass distribution of 100 t between 15–60 km, with most of the mass between 30 and 40km, peaking around 35 km. This total mass was distributed among the five bins, with 80% of the mass equally assigned the three smallest bins and 20% to two largest bins. For these initial simulations, we have retained the standard dust optical properties in GEOS-5, which are based on Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds database and roughly agree with the index of refraction reported for the Bruderheim meteorite. A movie is included in the supporting information depicting the time evolution of the modeled dust plume. A distinct dust plume emanating from Chelyabinsk is oriented in the zonal direction until it reaches North America around 23:00 UT on 16 February when its leading edge acquires a north–south orientation associated with a stratospheric ridge located to west of the Aleutian islands. As the plume exits North America, it again acquires a zonal orientation reaching its circumpolar nature around 22 February. Snapshots of the modeled plume about a week after initialization are shown in Figure  6 superimposed with the location of OMPS/LP retrievals. The model captures well the horizontal location of the observed plume as well as its vertical structure. By 25 February, a fully developed belt is established with portions of the plume having a bimodal structure not shown .GEOS-5 simulated meteoric dust optical depth AOD about 1 week after initialization on a 11:30 UT 21 February 2013, b 16:30 UT 22 February 2013, c 4:30 UT 22 February 2013, and d 21:30 UT 23 February 2013. The blue dots represent the location of the OMPS/LP retrieval where the modeled and observed vertical structure of the plume is compared. The normalized extinction is defined by scaling the extinction profiles by its maximum value above 30 km. The color bar is for aerosol AOD scaled by 10 6 .[8]  The Chelyabinsk meteor event ranks among the largest bolide events ever recorded the following are examples of largest bolides from last century: Tungiska, 1908; Brazilian bolide, 1930; Bolide in Spain, 1932; South African bolide, 1963 . For that event, the OMPS/LP instrument has proven to be a valuable tool allowing the science community to track the meteor plume in time and space and document its effects on the atmosphere. Furthermore, the current state of models and stratospheric meteorological data assimilation permit skillful prediction of the evolution meteoric dust plumes suggesting a great potential for the assimilation OMPS/LP aerosol retrievals in near real time.[9]  The Earth is constantly impacted by meteors, and meteoric debris are known to contribute to high-altitude atmospheric physics such as condensation nuclei for stratospheric and mesospheric clouds . These effects are still not well characterized, and it is hoped that further observations by OMPS/LP over its 5 year design lifetime will help in better understanding these effects. OMPS/LP could be used to scrutinize the upper atmosphere above the Junge layer in search for meteor debris, which will then allow one to 1 identify hitherto unobservable meteor events and 2 provide the needed information on meteoric dust to the atmospheric science community."
44,dust,"Low Arabian dust extinction-to-backscatter ratio. Compared to typical values of 50-60sr of the extinction-to-backscatter ratio lidar ratio at 532nm of western Saharan mineral dust, low dust lidar ratios from 33.7 +/- 6.7 to 39.1 +/- 5.1sr were derived from polarization lidar observations at Limassol, Cyprus 34 degrees N, 33 degrees E during an outbreak of Arabian dust mainly from Syria in September 2011, indicated by particle linear depolarization ratios up to 28%-35%. The applied new polarization-lidar/photometer method for the extraction of the dust-related lidar-ratio information from the lidar data is outlined, and the results of the dust outbreak which lasted over several days are discussed. The results confirm an Aerosol Robotic Network photometer study on Arabian dust lidar ratios. . It is also required to analyze standard backscatter lidar observations and to convert the retrieved profiles of the particle backscatter coefficient into particle extinction coefficients. The latter are used in the description of the radiative effect of aerosols direct effect on climate . Desert dust is one of the major components of atmospheric aerosols and the Saharan and Arabian deserts are among the major dust sources of the world. A good characterization of the optical properties of Saharan and Arabian dust particles is thus a prerequisite for an adequate consideration of mineral dust particles in radiative transfer calculations However, Arabian dust lidar studies are rare. showed that the illite concentration in dust particles decreases from values of about 80% in western Saharan to less than 5% in eastern Saharan and Arabian dust particles. This has a strong effect on the optical properties. found a significant decrease of the real part of the refractive index from 1.55 for Arabian dust to 1.45 for western Saharan dust for the 500–550 nm wavelength range. Accordingly, the lidar ratio dropped from values around 60 sr for western Saharan dust to values around 40 sr for Arabian dust as derived from column-integrated sun/sky photometer observations at 500 nm wavelength in cases with a dust fraction of more than 95%. However, comparisons of direct lidar ratio observations with Raman lidar observations indicate that the dust lidar ratio from photometer observations may be overestimated by 10%–20%. This is most probably caused by the use of a spheroidal particle model for the irregularly shaped desert dust particles in the model-based estimation of the scattering phase function at 180° scattering angle and the lidar ratio. In contrast to the lidar, the photometer is not able to directly measure particle scattering properties at 180° scattering angle. Here we present, for the first time, lidar-derived Arabian dust extinction-to-backscatter ratios and compare them with the results of. A new polarization-lidar-based approach is applied to extract the dust-related lidar ratio information from the total aerosol backscatter and extinction properties observed with the lidar/photometer combination. reported lidar ratios of 38±5 sr for aged Saudi Arabian dust after long range transport to Male, Maldives. However, depolarization ratios were not measured so that it remained an open question to what extent these aged dust air masses were contaminated by nondust aerosol particles. The lidar station of Cyprus University of Technology CUT at Limassol 34°N, 33°E, 50 m above sea level, asl is located at the south coast of the Cyprus island, about 150 km south of Turkey and 400 km west of Syria. The lidar transmits linearly polarized laser pulses at 532 nm and detects the parallel- and cross-polarized signal components. Calibration of the polarization channels is performed by rotating the box with the polarization sensitive channels following the methodology of.. Simulations based on the specific lidar configuration with an idealized well defined laser beam divergence show the full overlap already at 250 m height. Unfortunately, Raman signals were not available for the studied September 2011 period.. The CUT AERONET photometer allows the retrieval of the aerosol optical thickness AOT at 8 wavelengths from 339 to 1638 nm. Angle-dependent sky radiance observations at 4 wavelengths are performed in addition. From these measurements, the particle lidar ratio for the total tropospheric column can be derived. Comparisons with the lidar-derived lidar ratios will be discussed in section 4 ..: where R 0 and R 2 denote the bottom and top height of the troposphere, respectively. with the column lidar ratio as input. For the optimum input S T , the particle optical depth expressed by S T ∫ R 0 R 2 β T z d z matches the photometer-derived optical depth τ T in this one-aerosol-layer approach. For the lowermost heights below 300 m, where the overlap between laser beam and receiver field of view is incomplete , we assumed an almost well-mixed layer with a moderate, linear decrease of the particle backscatter coefficient by 10% from the surface to 300 m height during noon and afternoon hours and a linear decrease by a factor of 2 in the early morning hours at stable atmospheric conditions. This assumption on the near-range backscatter profile is based on careful inspections of a large number of profiles of the signal ratio of the 532 nm elastic backscatter signal to the 607 nm nitrogen Raman signal. This signal ratio is essentially independent of any overlap effect.. Now we search for the optimum pair of column lidar ratios S PBL and S FT which must fulfill the following condition: In practice, one of the two lidar ratios S PBL or S FT must be known a priori. A good knowledge of the climatological behavior of S PBL may be gathered from long-term observations of PBL lidar ratios in the absence of lofted layers. For Cyprus, typical values are around 35 sr in cases with about 50% contribution of marine particles lidar ratio 20 sr to particle extinction in the PBL, and another 50% contribution by urban haze lidar ratio of 50–60 sr according the AERONET fine-mode urban and coarse-mode marine AOT observations. When marine particles dominate, e.g., during situations with westerly winds, the lidar ratio is around 25 sr. However, the PBL AOT was of the order of 0.05 or less during the September 2011 period, and contributed <20% to the total AOT so that uncertainties in the S FT values were found to be around 10% when varying the S PBL by ±10 sr. In the last step, we separate the backscatter coefficients β FT,s z of spherical nondust particles fine mode and β FT,d z of nonspherical dust particles coarse mode in the free troposphere by means of the polarization lidar technique. Spherical particles e.g., anthropogenic haze, fire smoke cause a particle depolarization ratio of 5% or less, whereas desert dust leads to depolarization ratios of 30%–35%. Highly accurate depolarization-ratio measurements are needed in the retrieval. We checked our depolarization ratios frequently by analyzing the values in the marine boundary layer where the depolarization ratio must be ≤5% in the absence of dust. After the separation, the following relationship between the optical depth of all particles, nonspherical, and spherical particles must be fulfilled: Here S FT,s must be assumed a priori and is estimated from our long-term lidar/photometer observations of free tropospheric aerosols in the absence of desert dust. S FT,s values are around 60–70 sr in cases when urban haze and smoke dominate and around 40 sr during situation with westerly winds and air mass transport from the Mediterranean area. The retrieved product is finally the dust lidar ratio S FT,d in lofted desert-dust-laden plumes. The 5% deviation criterium must hold for equations  3 and 4 now.. The color coding corresponds to the logarithm of the sum of the residence time of all air parcels that have passed over a pixel source region between 0–2000 m height and finally reached Limassol between 1000–2500 m height. From Figure  2 , one can see that the lofted desert dust layer extended from 500 to 2500 m. The particle depolarization ratio was >25% for heights >1300 m and reached a maximum value of 35% in the strongest dust layer. A maximum value of the particle backscatter coefficient of 12 Mm −1 sr −1 was observed and points to particle extinction coefficients of about 500 Mm −1 . The AERONET photometer observations showed a clear bimodal size distribution with a strong coarse mode. Fine-mode and coarse-mode effective radii were 0.12 and 2 μm, respectively. Table  1 and Figure  3 provide an overview of all observations and the required lidar ratio assumptions. The assumed boundary-layer lidar ratios S PBL were carefully selected after studying the meteorological situation. A high value of 35 sr was selected in the case of northerly winds so that the marine impact was comparably low. A lower value of 25 sr was taken during sea breeze events or when strong westerly winds and thus marine particles prevailed in the boundary layer, as was the case on 30 September. According to Table  1 and Figure  3 , all observations with strong dust impact from 28 September, case 2, to 30 September, case 1 indicate desert dust lidar ratios around 34–39 sr.Listed are the top height of the PBL, column lidar ratios S T after equation  3 and S T,A 532 nm, from AERONET data , S PBL assumed PBL lidar ratio , S FT FT column lidar ratio, equation  4 , S FT,s assumed FT lidar ratio of nondust particles, equation  4 , and S FT,d retrieved FT lidar ratio of coarse dust, equation  4 .Overview of observed dust optical properties for the period from 28–30 September 2011. top Tropospheric AOT green and coarse-mode dust FT AOT red . middle FT dust lidar ratio S FT,d with one-standard-deviation error bar. bottom Observed maximum FT particle linear depolarization ratio.. The derived S T,A values are in reasonable agreement with the lidar–derived column lidar ratios. found values of 37–45 sr over AERONET sites in the Arabian desert area for cases with almost negligible fine-mode contribution to AOT. Our dust-related lidar ratios S FT,d values are slightly lower by about 10% which is in agreement with more direct comparisons of Raman lidar and photometer observations and may be related to the used spheroidal particle model in the AERONET retrieval. modeled dust lidar ratios . 2 Because lidars provide directly measured information on 180° scattering, the combined lidar/photometer retrieval method applied here does not depend on critical assumptions spheroidal dust particle model . 3 The importance of polarization lidar measurements for the retrieval of dust-related lidar ratio was demonstrated. Without depolarization ratio information, dust lidar ratios cannot be quantified properly because the influence of non-dust aerosol components remains unknown."
46,impact particles aerosol,"An evaluation of the potential radiative forcing and climatic impact of marine organic aerosols as heterogeneous ice nuclei. Observational evidence demonstrates that marine organic aerosols MOA are able to act as ice nuclei. MOA explains a substantial portion of the submicron marine aerosol, so that they have the potential to effectively influence marine cloud microphysics and cloud radiative forcing. This study provides the first evaluation of the radiative forcing and climatic impact of marine organic aerosols as ice nuclei on a global scale. MOA is implemented into a coupled aerosol and general circulation model. It is found that MOA contributes to more ice formation than dust or black carbon/organic matter in mixed-phase clouds. They also have a significant impact on the ice water path in the Southern Hemisphere and therefore could be an important missing source of ice nuclei in current models. The addition of MOA as natural heterogeneous ice nuclei reduces the magnitude of the total top-of-atmosphere anthropogenic aerosol forcing by as much as 0.3 W/m 2 . . Marine organic aerosols MOA can be of primary or secondary origin. Primary MOAs are directly ejected from the ocean surface through bubble bursting processes and are composed of whole cells or fragments of phytoplankton, polysaccharides, and proteins. Secondary MOAs are produced within the atmosphere from the oxidation of emitted biogenic volatile organic compounds VOCs such as isoprene, monoterpenes, and amines.. The properties of primary MOA are not well known, particularly for large organic plume events where dichotomous behavior of low hygroscopicity and high CCN activity is encountered. During such events, CCN concentrations can exceed 400 per cc and, given their hydrogel properties, are likely to contribute in significant numbers to heterogeneous ice nuclei IN . However, there are only a few studies of the effects of MOA acting as ice nuclei. Several observational studies report that marine aerosols may act as ice nuclei. Bigg B73 hereafter made long-term measurements of ice nuclei concentrations in the marine boundary layer over Australia and the Antarctic Ocean. He found that the highest ice nuclei concentrations were in the subtropical convergence zone along the 40S parallel, where marine biological activities are strong due to nutrient upwelling. Schnell and Schnell and Vali found that seawater which is rich in phytoplankton is a good source of ice nuclei, with some active IN at temperatures as high as −4°C. More recently, Knopf et al . identified the marine phytoplanktonic diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana as efficient ice nuclei in the deposition mode at typical cirrus onset temperatures and in the immersion mode at mixed-phase cloud temperatures. DeMott et al . measured the ice nucleation activity of laboratory generated sea spray aerosols and found the lowest IN concentrations in samples with high organic aerosol loading, but IN concentrations increased following the addition of bacteria and nutrients after the cells had fed on these nutrients. found that after switching to an aerosol-dependent ice nucleation parameterization, and adjusting the contact freezing parameterization of Young to fit the Blanchard observations, the model under-predicted the ice water path in the Southern Hemisphere SH by about 30 g/m 2 near 60S. The original Young parameterization was a temperature scaling of the IN concentration measured by the Blanchard at −4°C 0.2 cm −3 . Most models replace this 0.2 cm −3 with aerosol concentrations without applying any restrictions. Yun and Penner restricted the predicted contact ice nuclei to fit the Blanchard measurement 0.2 cm −3 for the same condition. This renders the contact ice nuclei to be 0.2% of the dust number concentration and 0.02% of black carbon and organic matter BOC number concentration at −4°C. Part of the reason for the decrease in the ice water path was that only dust, black carbon, and terrestrial organic carbon were ice nuclei in the parameterization, as is also the case in other aerosol-dependent parameterizations. This change resulted in an under-prediction of ice water in the SH, and led to a bias in the present-day cloud radiative forcing. This problem does not seem to be present in other global models that use aerosol-dependent ice nucleation parameterizations, but these models have not limited contact nucleation in the same manner as we do. for cloud liquid and ice. Heterogeneous ice nucleation in mixed-phase clouds is treated using Phillips et al . and the adjusted Young parameterization. The Eidhammer et al . modification to Phillips et al . has been incorporated. The IMPACT aerosol transport model considers detailed sulfate chemistry and emission, dry deposition, and wet deposition for all other major aerosols types organic aerosols, black carbon, dust, and sea salt . The model has also been updated to predict three levels of hygroscopicity for fossil fuel soot and the effects of hygroscopicity on ice nucleation. and uses the Martensson et al . scheme for particles < 2.8 µm and the Monahan and O'Muircheartaigh parameterization for sea-salt sizes larger than 2.8 µm. The second method is that proposed by Jaegle et al ., who added a dependence on the sea surface temperature SST to the Gong parameterization. The mass fraction of sea salt that is associated with organics was parameterized using either the Gantt et al . parameterization or the modified Vignati et al . parameterization, which in turn is based on the scheme originally proposed by O'Dowd et al .. MOA are predicted for the same four size bins as sea salt, namely, for radii ranging from 0.05 to 0.63 µm, 0.63 to 1.26 µm, 1.26 to 2.5 µm, and 2.5 to 10 µm. The density of MOA is assumed to be 1 g/cm 3 ., we did not use the B73 data directly. Instead, we used the ratio of the measured ice nuclei concentrations at different locations together with our model-estimated aerosol concentrations. Schnell and Vali have calculated the average ice nuclei concentration over Australia and the Antarctic Ocean 40S latitude band based on B73. At −15°C at water saturation, the ratio of ice nuclei number concentration between the two regions Australia:40S was 1:3. parameterization by fitting the 1:3 ratio between Australia and 40S as summarized in the following equation: C O is the modeled number concentration for other aerosol types besides MOA, i.e., dust and BOC at Australia Au and at 40S 40 . C MOA is the MOA number concentration for the same regions. Fo is the frozen fraction of non-MOA aerosol at −15°C at water saturation, as predicted using the Phillips et al . parameterization. Fmoa is the MOA frozen fraction for the same condition and is the only unknown variable here. We set an upper limit for Fmoa of 100%. Using this equation, we calculated the frozen fraction of MOA at −15°C at water saturation, to be 3.75% for the smallest size bin 0.05–0.63 µm , and 100% for all of the larger size bins. These fractions are then used to constrain the Phillips parameterization as applied for all other conditions. The nucleation efficiency is larger for larger size bins due to the dependence of the nucleation efficiency on the aerosol surface area. As a comparison, laboratory measurements by Knopf et al . showed that at 240K and RH of 95%, about 63% of aqueous NaCl droplets containing marine diatoms freeze in 9 s.. Burrows et al . parameterized marine biological IN emission at −15°C with sea spray emissions modified by an ocean biological variable chlorophyll or particulate organic carbon , and a scaling factor, which was calculated as a product of five factors. The value for the scaling factor was chosen so that the IN concentrations agreed as well as possible with the B73 observations. The frozen fraction of marine organic aerosol at −15°C calculated using their method is on the order of 10 −4 −10 −5 whereas our method predicts a value of 3.75% for the smallest size bin 0.05–0.63 µm , and 100% for the larger size bins. at Halley, Antarctica by about a factor of 2 see comparison in Wang et al . . On the other hand, the Phillips et al . parameterization has been shown to overpredict ice nucleation by dust and soot at warm subzero temperatures. At −15°C, the overprediction is about a factor of 10. The model predicted marine organic concentrations in Lapina et al . were shown to be larger than observations by as much as a factor of 6. Since the submicron MOA emissions rates in Lapina et al . are close to those predicted by our model section 3.1 , we expect our model to have a similar overprediction in comparison to observations. Taking these various factors into account, the “true” MOA frozen fraction might be different than our derived value by a factor of 1.2. Below, we test the sensitivity of the simulated ice/liquid water path and cloud radiative forcing to the derived MOA ice nucleation efficiency by increasing and decreasing the efficiency by a factor of 10, which covers the range of uncertainty. sea-salt emission, Gantt et al . MOA fraction Sslt_Emis Sea-salt emission changed to Jaegle et al . MOA_Frac MOA fraction changed to modified Vignati et al . Frz_Less Reference case with ice nucleation efficiency of MOA decreased by a factor of 10 Frz_More Reference case with ice nucleation efficiency of MOA increased by a factor of 10 sea-salt emission function produces smaller emissions for the first two size bins, but larger emissions for the larger sizes. Larger MOA emissions than the reference case are produced for all size bins using the modified Vignati et al . MOA fractions. Assuming an OM/OC ratio of 1.4, the submicron < 1 µm MOA emissions for the Reference, Sslt_Emis, and MOA_Frac cases are 8.24, 5.59, and 9.29 TgC/yr, respectively. These are close to the predicted submicron MOA emissions from Lapina et al . 8.2–8.9 TgC/yr . The emissions of MOA for the Reference case 11.53 Tg/yr are larger than that predicted by Meskhidze et al . 9.4 Tg/yr with the same sea salt and MOA fraction. One possible reason is the larger wind speed between 40 and 60S in the CAM3+ model compared to that in CAM5, which was the model used by Meskhidze et al .. also found that marine ice nuclei play a dominant role in determining ice nuclei concentrations over the Southern Ocean.Ice number concentration from dust DM , black and organic carbon BOC , and MOA for condensation/immersion freezing left column , and contact freezing right column in the Reference case. The global mean IWP increases from 16.13 g/m 2 in the No_MOA case to 21.83 g/m 2 in the Reference case, which is in better agreement with the observed value of 21.2 g/m 2 Table  3 . The global mean liquid water path LWP also decreases due to the Bergeron-Findeisen process by 20.74 g/m 2 , which brings it to within the range of satellite observations. The absolute value of the net cloud forcing NCF decreases by 1.81 W/m 2 .[19]  The simulations with MOA as a heterogeneous ice nuclei using the standard derived ice nucleation efficiency cases Reference, Sslt_Emis, and MOA_Frac compare better to satellite observations of IWP, LWP, short-wave cloud forcing SWCF , and long-wave cloud forcing LWCF than do the simulations with MOA ice nucleation efficiencies increased or decreased by a factor of 10 Frz_More and Frz_Less . The latter either overestimate or underestimate these variables compared to satellite observations. Generally, varying the ice nucleation efficiency of MOA produces larger changes in IWP than changing the MOA emission rates as a result of using different parameterizations. Experimental studies that better quantify the ice nucleation efficiencies of MOA aerosols are needed for more accurate estimates of their effect on IWP.[20]  This study is the first assessment of the radiative forcing and climatic impact of marine organic aerosols as a result of their action as heterogeneous ice nuclei in mixed-phase clouds. MOA is found to contribute more to ice formation than dust or BOC in mixed-phase clouds. As ice nuclei, marine organic aerosols have significant impact on the IWP in the Southern Hemisphere. The comparison of IWP to ISCCP observations is improved significantly with the addition of MOA as heterogeneous ice nuclei in mixed-phase clouds. However, global models up to now do not have any considerations of MOA as heterogeneous ice nuclei. Our study points out that this could be an important missing ice nuclei source for the SH. To examine the effect of including MOA as heterogeneous ice nuclei to the anthropogenic aerosol forcing, we also conducted preindustrial runs for the No_MOA case and the Reference case. We note that the addition of MOA reduces the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol net cloud forcing including changes in all cloud types from −0.36 to −0.03 W/m 2 , i.e., by 0.33 W/m 2 Table  3 . The anthropogenic aerosol top-of-atmosphere TOA net forcing is reduced from −2.82 W/m 2 to −2.52 W/m 2 . Since our results indicate that the ice nucleation efficiency of MOA could be fairly large, future laboratory studies and field campaigns that focus on the ice nucleation properties of MOA are needed for a more accurate estimate of their effect."
48,dust impact aerosol,"Improving simulations of fine dust surface concentrations over the western United States by optimizing the particle size distribution. To improve estimates of remote contributions of dust to fine particulate matter PM2.5 in the western United States, new dust particle size distributions PSDs based upon scale-invariant fragmentation theory Kok_PSD with constraints from in situ measurements IMP_PSD are implemented in a chemical transport model GEOS-Chem . Compared to initial simulations, this leads to reductions in the mass of emitted dust particles with radii <1.8 mu m by 40%-60%. Consequently, the root-mean-square error in simulated fine dust concentrations compared to springtime surface observations in the western United States is reduced by 67%-81%. The ratio of simulated fine to coarse PM mass is also improved, which is not achievable by reductions in total dust emissions. The IMP_PSD best represents the PSD of dust transported from remote sources and reduces modeled PM2.5 concentrations up to 5 mu g/m 3 over the western United States, which is important when considering sources contributing to nonattainment of air quality standards. . Accordingly, surface dust concentrations in the western United States in spring are influenced not only by local sources but also by transpacific transport of Asian 49%–77%, depending on season and African 15%–34% dust, with the Asian dust contributing between 0.2 and 1.0 µg/m 3 in the spring. This transpacific dust transport contributes to concentrations of fine particulate matter PM 2.5 above attainment thresholds set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA , which leads to degradation of public health and visibility., are often used to investigate impacts of dust on surface air quality, visibility, and long-range transport. Significant positive biases have been identified in GEOS-Chem simulations of surface dust concentration and dust aerosol optical depth AOD compared to observations. Large uncertainties exist in the particle size distribution PSD of emitted dust in such models since the PSD from different soil types is not well known. As the lifetime and transport of dust particles are highly size dependent, understanding the size distribution of dust particles is therefore of great importance for estimating the impacts of domestic versus distant sources of dust on local air quality and visibility.. This scheme leads to simulated dust PSD in good agreement with field measurements and indicates that most models overestimate the relative contribution of clay dust particles <2 µm diameter by a factor of ~2–8. Revisions to dust PSDs in atmospheric circulation models support these conclusions. Based on the latter work, Ridley et al . showed that redistributing the PSD of submicron dust in GEOS-Chem's optical calculations i.e., not affecting dust mass concentrations leads to improved agreement of modeled AOD compared to the Aerosol Robotic Network. Johnson et al . applied the PSD of Kok in GEOS-Chem across the entire size range of emitted particles, showing improved agreement with space-born measurements of AOD and extinction. Kok_PSD and a new parameterization, developed here based on Kok_PSD, that is consistent with measurements in the size range of 0.1–1.0 µm from the Dust and Biomass-burning Experiment DABEX . The impact of changing PSD and reducing dust mass emission on the ratio of fine dust versus coarse dust 2.5 µm < diameter < 10 µm is also investigated.. We use GEOS-Chem version 9-01-01 driven by GEOS-5 meteorological fields, 2° latitude  × 2.5° longitude horizontal resolution, and 47 vertical layers between the surface and 0.01 hPa. A nested simulation over North America with 1/2° latitude  × 2/3° longitude horizontal resolution is performed for comparison. The standard dust scheme in GEOS-Chem is the dust entrainment and deposition DEAD mobilization scheme of Zender et al ., combined with the source function used in the Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport GOCART model as described by Fairlie et al ... The smallest size bin is further divided equally into four submicron size bins with effective radii centered at 0.15, 0.25, 0.4, and 0.8 µm for calculation of optical properties and heterogeneous chemistry; the mass distribution within the submicron bins does not affect dust mass concentrations. The size-resolved mass fractions of the standard dust scheme in GEOS-Chem GC_PSD are shown in Table  1 . Fine dust concentration is estimated by summing the first bin and 38% of the second bin. data available at http://vista.cira.colostate.edu/improve/ . Figure S1 in the supporting information shows the 70 IMPROVE sites in the western United States; these are remote sites situated at various elevations. Surface soil dust concentrations are calculated as the sum of the soil-derived elements Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, and Fe and their normal oxides. Fine dust mass is estimated using the formula of Malm et al .. GEOS-Chem model results are sampled according to the IMPROVE observations 24 h averages every 3 days at the locations of the IMPROVE sites in California CA, 19 sites , Washington WA, 9 sites , Oregon OR, 6 sites , Nevada NV, 3 sites , Idaho ID, 3 sites , Utah UT, 5 sites , Arizona AZ, 17 sites , and Colorado CO, 8 sites . Nevertheless, the comparison between localized observations with model results that are representative of a much larger area is inherently problematic. In addition, the comparison is further complicated by the fact that many of the IMPROVE sites are located in mountainous areas, and the associated upslope flow is difficult to represent in a coarse-resolution model. Therefore, dust concentrations are averaged for IMPROVE sites within each state when comparing modeled to observed values. derived the following theoretical expression for the emitted dust size distribution based on the physics of scale-invariant fragmentation of brittle material, used WRF-Chem to simulate dust, considering two different size distributions of emitted dust. One is suggested by Osborne et al . based on aircraft measurements, and the other one is obtained by comparing the simulated dust PSD with the observations from the DABEX field campaign in North Africa. The dust simulation better captured the cross-sectional area size distribution of the aircraft measurements with the “Modal1” PSD. In Figure  1 , we overlap the GC_PSD red line and Kok_PSD green line with the result “Modal1” of Zhao et al . black line . Both the Kok_PSD and the Zhao et al . PSD are quite different from the GC_PSD, especially for particle radii less than 0.4 µm. The Kok_PSD is more consistent with that of Zhao et al . for particle radii less than 4 µm. However, more than 30% differences are indicated in the radius range of 0.1–0.4 µm, which is the range of the first size bin in GEOS-Chem, meaning that fewer dust particles in the first size bin would be emitted with the Kok_PSD. In equation 1 , the side crack propagation length λ is obtained from a least squares fit to measurements. Fundamentally, λ is rather uncertain as it depends on poorly constrained factors like soil cohesion. For instance, changes in soil moisture, and thus cohesion, can produce changes in the value of λ . Therefore, the value of λ is very difficult to describe theoretically and can be expected to depend on soil parameters such as mineralogy, soil moisture, and size distribution. For instance, the data set of emitted dust PSDs measured in the Japan-Australia Dust Experiment JADE is in good agreement with the theory of Kok but has a lower value of λ than that of Kok_PSD.Comparison of normalized volume size distributions of emitted dust particles between GC_PSD red line , Kok_PSD green line , IMP_PSD blue line , and the results of Zhao et al . black line . The radii ranges of the four size bins in GEOS-Chem are shaded with different colors., yielding a value of λ  = 8 µm, with a corresponding change of the normalization constant c V  = 6.83 . This value of λ is also consistent with the spread shown in observational data sets, such as Shao et al .. The new PSD blue line nearly overlaps the results of Zhao et al . see black line in the clay size bin <2 µm diameter, see Figure  1 . We refer to this as the IMP_PSD blue line , for which the size-resolved mass fractions are provided in Table  1 . The IMP_PSD will emit more particles in the first size bin clay size but less in the fourth size bin compared to the Kok_PSD. Compared to the Kok_PSD, the IMP_PSD shows positive bias relative to the result of Zhao et al . for coarse particle with radii between 0.7 and 4 µm. The PSD for relatively large dust sizes range >~5 µm radii shows substantial variation between data set with different soil properties and is thus uncertain. These variations in the dust PSD impact model estimates of local dust sources on coarse >5 µm radii aerosol. While the performance of the above PSDs for large particles >5 µm radii warrants further study, we focus in this work on the PSD for particles limited to the size range in GEOS-Chem <6.0 µm radii , which is of most importance for assessing the influence of long-range aerosol on PM 2.5 concentrations over the western United States. While the IMP_PSD is an overall improvement compared to the GC_PSD and the Kok_PSD in AZ, NV, ID, and CO, some discrepancies persist after mid-April in these states, in which sites are in or downwind of local dust source regions. To investigate this, we performed sensitivity simulations SW_contrib in which we zeroed out dust emission over the western U.S. source region 30°N–42°N, 120°W–108°W, see Figure  1 . These simulations indicate that for the IMP_PSD, the peak dust concentrations in NV, AZ, and UT are dominated by local contributions after mid-April see Figure  2 , the blue dash line , especially in AZ. In contrast, coastal states CA, WA, and OR are not highly influenced by local emissions but are instead dominated by long-range transport, in agreement with previous studies. Model PSDs significantly impact the fine dust concentrations from both local and remote sources. Further, the peak dust concentrations see the black arrows in Figure  2 in late March observed in most states, and most intensely in AZ, NV, ID, and CO, are well captured by the IMP_PSD for the West Coast states but underestimated in the four inland states. However, the magnitude of this peak is reproduced by the GC_PSD in some inland states e.g., NV, CO, and ID . Further, nearly every modeled peak with the IMP_PSD in AZ that approaches 3 µg/m 3 has two noticeable features: more than 90% contribution from local sources SW_contrib and overestimation of the measurements. Therefore, the IMP_PSD appears consistent with the size distribution of transpacific dust particles emitted from Asia and Africa, in particular the African dust, since the IMP_PSD represents the DABEX measurements over Africa. It also suggests that the IMP_PSD may not represent the PSD well in the North American source regions, especially for smaller size bins.. Mechanistically, these changes to fine dust could also be achieved by reducing the total mass of dust emission over the source regions. To separate the impacts of PSD versus total emissions, we consider the ratio of fine to coarse dust. With the GC_PSD, this ratio is a factor of 3 larger than the observed ratio of fine dust to coarse PM over CA Figure S3 . While acknowledging that the observed ratio contains contributions from nondust species in the coarse PM and, hence, some overestimation by the model is expected, these would unlikely be substantial enough to explain the factor of 3 differences noted here. We therefore consider a sensitivity experiment based on the GC_PSD with dust emissions exterior to the western United States reduced by 50% GC_0.5xEmi . While this does reduce the bias in the simulation of fine dust concentration over CA and AZ by 74% and 25%, respectively Figure S4 , the ratio of fine dust versus coarse dust does not change Figure S3 . In contrast, changing the PSD not only improves the fine dust simulation Figure  2 but also improves the ratio of fine dust versus coarse dust by 65%–75% Figure S3 . While the comparisons of the Kok_PSD and IMP_PSD to the measurements of Zhao et al . for dust with radii between 0.7 and 4 µm imply a low bias for the former and a high bias for the latter, both schemes lead to significant reductions in the ratio of fine to coarse dust compared to GC_PSD. Thus, the overall comparisons of these schemes to the GC_PSD are not governed by the fitting or lack thereof of the new PSDs for particles in this size range. would also likely improve the model simulations.. More measurements of the size distributions of emitted dust spanning a broad range of soil properties could allow the development of soil-specific source parameters. Constraints on the fundamental parameters governing dust mobilization schemes would be of value for improving our understanding of the factors governing dust emissions. Such fundamental source parameters may also be constrained using inverse modeling, which has thus far focused largely on adjusting the total mass of dust emissions.[17]  Overall, adjustment of the dust PSD not only improves the dust simulation in GEOS-Chem but also revises our estimate of the role of long-range transport on PM 2.5 in the western United States. The U.S. EPA recently strengthened the annual National Ambient Air Quality Standard NAAQS for PM 2.5 from 15.0 to 12.0 µg/m 3 http://www.epa.gov/airquality/particlepollution/actions.html#dec12 . While this alone increases the fractional contribution of background sources to nonattainment, given that background PM 2.5 concentrations may have been overestimated in the spring by as much as 5 µg/m 3 , controlling local sources of PM 2.5 may yet be nearly as effective in approaching attainment of the revised NAAQS as previously thought."
47,dust particles aerosol,"Shape-induced gravitational sorting of Saharan dust during transatlantic voyage: Evidence from CALIOP lidar depolarization measurements. Motivated by the physical picture of shape-dependent air resistance and, consequently, shape-induced differential sedimentation of dust particles, we searched for and found evidence of dust particle asphericity affecting the evolution and distribution of dust-scattered light depolarization ratio . Specifically, we examined a large data set of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization CALIOP observations of Saharan dust from June to August 2007. Observing along a typical transatlantic dust track, we find that 1 median is uniformly distributed between 2 and 5km altitudes as the elevated dust leaves the west coast of Africa, thereby indicating uniformly random mixing of particle shapes with height; 2 vertical homogeneity of median breaks down during the westward transport: between 2 and 5km increases with altitude and this increase becomes more pronounced with westward progress; 3 tends to increase at higher altitude >4km and decrease at lower altitude <4km during the westward transport. All these features are captured qualitatively by a minimal model two shapes only , suggesting that shape-induced differential settling and consequent sorting indeed contribute significantly to the observed temporal evolution and vertical stratification of dust properties. By implicating particle shape as a likely cause of gravitational sorting, these results will affect the estimates of radiative transfer through Saharan dust layers.  and size of particles, and can change as dust interacts with other substances in the air. In addition, the scattering and absorbing properties of dust are also affected by particle shape. For example, the asphericity of particles can enhance forward scattering and reduce back scattering and can make single scattering albedo and extinction coefficient different from their spherical counterparts. Hence, particle asphericity needs to be considered in dust radiative forcing calculations. To that end, we recall that particle shape affects air resistance drag as well and can, therefore, influence the vertical distribution of dust properties during transatlantic transport. Hence, the radiative and fluid-mechanical aspects of dust transport can be linked via particle shape and we now proceed to employ this link.. Therefore, one would expect populations of irregular particles and spherical particles of the same mass and density to gradually separate, and dust layers to stratify, with the eventual preponderance of the most aspherical particles at the top as illustrated schematically in Figure  1 . Our observations suggest that such processes may actually occur under ambient conditions.Schematic illustration of shape-induced differential sedimentation: because of the higher settling speed of spherical particles, the initially mixed groups of spherical blue and aspherical orange particles all at the same mass and volume , gradually separate, creating a stratified structure with the preponderance of aspherical particles at the top.. The depolarization ratio is defined as the ratio of an echo's cross-polarized and copolarized components. CALIOP Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization provides two types of depolarization ratio: volume depolarization ratio and particulate depolarization ratio. Since the particulate depolarization ratio is free of contributions from molecular scattering and attenuation, whereas the volume depolarization ratio is influenced by both, the particulate depolarization ratio is more suitable for describing the properties of dust itself. Therefore, depolarization ratio henceforth refers to “particulate depolarization ratio”, denoted as δ. This ratio is zero for spherical particles but not for aspherical ones.. CALIPSO was launched in 2006 and provides range-resolved cloud and aerosol data along its track, including total lidar backscatter at 532 nm and 1064 nm, and perpendicularly polarized lidar backscatter at 532 nm. CALIPSO operational algorithms currently in Version 3 use this data along with altitude and latitude information for feature identification and classification,. Let us now examine the vertical distribution of δ dust particulate depolarization ratio using CALIOP dust data provided at 5 km horizontal resolution. The CALIOP aerosol layer product delivers vertically averaged particulate depolarization ratio for each aerosol layer by removing the contributions from molecular Rayleigh scattering and attenuation. Our analysis keeps the noise level low by aggregating statistics over each of the nine 10° by 30° regions at 270 or 540 m vertical resolution. A dust sample is counted in an altitude bin if the dust layer top and base altitudes in the CALIOP aerosol layer product indicate that the altitude bin contains dust within a 5 km-resolution segment. The depolarization ratio of the dust layer is then included into the statistics of this altitude bin. In order to reduce interference from clouds, only dust layers in fully cloud-free columns are used with no clouds identified by either the 0.333 km, 1 km, or 5 km resolution CALIOP cloud products within the entire 5 km segment . Finally, we constrain misclassification between ice clouds and dust by considering only data below 5 km, as ice clouds during summer in the examined region seldom occur below this altitude., the chosen data set contains many outbreaks without having to combine data from different seasons.Median of dust particulate depolarization ratio δ: a as a function of altitude in the nine regions; b as a function of altitude in Regions 2 to 6; c as a function of longitude-regions. The vertical resolution is 540 m. Uncertainties in median estimates are calculated by the bootstrapping algorithm. As the dust leaves the west coast of Africa Region 2 , the δ values at all altitudes above ~2 km are about the same but in the course of westward transport, the depolarization spreads out with higher ratios at higher altitudes. Furthermore, the depolarization ratio lapse rate increases westward. The altitude-independent δ in Region 2 indicates that particles of various shapes are randomly mixed throughout the atmospheric column. The progressive westward dispersion of δ suggests a separation of dust by shape-induced differential settling. The longer time causes wider vertical separation, and consequently, a higher lapse rate of the vertically increasing δ is observed with westward transport. See text for more details. The basic features described above are consistent with the shape-induced differential settling of dust particles. To illustrate this process, let us consider a minimal model: settling of only two spheroid particle shapes, with aspect ratios λ 1 and λ 2 . The initial vertical distribution of total samples at t  = 0 time is then f o h  =  f o 1 h  +  f o 2 h where f o 1 h and f o 2 h are the initial vertical distributions of samples for the two particle shapes. We further assume that all particles have the same density and mass, and hence mass-equivalent size. This two-shape, one-size assumption is plausible because measurements do not show significant dependence of aspect ratio on particle size, allowing us to disentangle shape and size effects. Because higher aspect ratio corresponds to lower settling speed v and higher depolarization ratio δ , a relationship λ 1  > λ 2 in our simple dust layer implies v 1  <  v 2 , and δ 1  > δ 2 . The above scenario of two-shape one-size dust layers can be formalized as follows: if the shapes of function f o 1 h and f o 2 h do not change significantly during the settling process, the vertical distribution of dust samples becomes f h , t  =  f 1 h , t  +  f 2 h , t where f 1 h , t  =  f o 1 h  +  v ● t and f 2 h , t  =  f o 2 h  +  v 2 ● t are the two dust sample vertical distributions at time t , correspondingly. Additionally, the average δ can be estimated using δ h , t  =  and because δ has relatively distinguishable values around λ ~ 1.2, we choose λ 1  = 2.7 at the larger end of recent measurements by Kandler et al . but below the average λ of 1.2 and 5 and δ 1  = 0.4 for the first group of particles, and λ 2  = 1.1 the average λ of 1 and 1.2 and δ 2  = 0.1 for the second group; 2 additionally, since the typical size is ~7 µm in diameter for transatlantic dust, we choose v 2  ~ 1600 cm/hr nearly spherical particle because of λ 2  ~ 1.1 and v 1  =  v 2 1–0.2 where 0.2 is the fall speed reduction rate for λ 1 and is estimated from the theoretical reductions in fall speed for λ = 1 and λ = 5 for 7 µm size; and 3 finally, the initial distribution functions of f o 1 h and f o 2 h are set to be Gaussian functions with a mean altitude of 4.5 km and standard deviation of 3 km. The illustrated δ vertical distributions are the averages over 24 h-long time spans. While a skeptical reader might object that these values chosen for the model parameters are somewhat arbitrary, it should be noted that the key features of the results hold for a wide range of values used in our simulations. The differences between the model and CALIOP observations are mostly in the specific values such as the altitude of depolarization ratio at which δ in a certain region surpasses δ in the preceding region. Generalizing to several aspect ratios and size distributions readily reduces these differences. Note that although altitudes below 2 km are displayed in our figures, one should not compare observations and simulations below 2 km, because CALIOP observations are affected by nearly spherical marine aerosols at these altitudes., to our knowledge, no link of this process to observations has ever been attempted. This may be due to limitations in the available observations, such as the large noise in measurements of δ or insufficient spatial coverage and duration of observations. Our CALIOP data set of transatlantic dust over a summer season reveals that the shape-dependent settling and the resulting shape-dependent layer structure are significant at oceanic and seasonal scales. This is consistent with the earlier studies that characterized African dust during the Puerto Rico Dust Experiment and found dust to have a significantly higher aspect ratio near 1.9 after long-range transport. Could these CALIPSO observations be spurious, i.e., attributed to algorithmic artifacts? Indeed, CALIPSO dust δ values are retrieved quantities that mostly rely on a predefined lidar ratio. Because this predefined lidar-ratio is a constant, it cannot follow the fluctuations of dust size and density that play a role in multiple scattering and thus, in the ideal lidar-ratio values. As such, a constant lidar-ratio could conceivably lead to a westward and upward increasing bias of δs as large particles settle out gradually during transport multiple scattering is reduced. Then, a higher lidar-ratio is required to compensate for loosing large particles. However, this mechanism does not lead to the westward decreasing trend of depolarization ratio at 2–4 km in Regions 2–5 observed by CALIPSO Figure  3 c . Moreover, the CALIPSO δ retrieval is not sensitive to the lidar ratio, and the backscatter coefficient retrievals compare well with the ground measurements. Therefore, the observed trend in particulate depolarization ratio is more likely ascribed to shape-induced sedimentation.[17]  In this study we asked: Does the effect of particle shape on differential sedimentation cause an evolving vertical stratification as dust plumes are transported westward across the Atlantic? If so, such stratification should be discernible from CALIOP data on δ. We then searched for and discovered evidences of dust particle asphericity affecting the evolution and patterns of scattered light depolarization ratio δ .[18]  Specifically, shape-induced gravitational sorting is evidenced by the summertime observations of evolving patterns in lidar signal depolarization measurements from the CALIPSO satellite. Here we demonstrate that even a minimal two-shape one-size model of dust particle settling captures qualitatively the basic features of observations. The results show a clearly increasing stratification in δ as dust moves. Finally, we note that knowledge of dust vertical distributions can improve the accuracy of aerosol optical depth and particle size retrievals. For example, in optically thick dust layers, particle properties near the top can affect satellite observations more than those at lower altitudes, thus the assumption of vertical homogeneity in dust property retrievals can lead to biased results when the vertical distribution of particle shape is inhomogeneous. Therefore, our results imply that particle shape-dependent settling hence the induced vertical distribution of δ is important not only in studies of dust transport and sedimentation but also in estimating dust optical properties, radiative forcing, and dust loading."
50,dust particles aerosol clouds impact,"Sensitivities of immersion freezing: Reconciling classical nucleation theory and deterministic expressions. Ice particle number concentrations are often described deterministically, i.e., ice nucleation is singular and occurs on active sites unambiguously at a given temperature. Other approaches are based on classical nucleation theory CNT that describes ice nucleation stochastically as a function of time and nucleation rate. Sensitivity studies of CNT for immersion freezing performed here show that ice nucleation has by far the lowest sensitivity to time as compared to temperature, ice nucleus IN diameter, and contact angle. Sensitivities generally decrease with decreasing temperature. Our study helps to reconcile the apparent differences in stochastic and singular freezing behavior, and suggests that over a wide range of temperatures and IN parameters, time-independent CNT-based expressions for immersion freezing may be derived for use in large-scale models. . Heterogeneous ice nucleation is more complex since freezing occurs via different modes immersion, deposition, or contact freezing that all require the knowledge of ice nucleus IN properties that are much more poorly understood. For heterogeneous freezing, the relevant temperature T range is 234 K <  T  < 273 K; at lower T , homogeneous freezing becomes dominant.. More refined parameterizations include IN composition and particle size. These expressions are based on continuous flow diffusion chambers CFDC in which ambient particles are exposed to conditions of controlled T and/or supersaturation. Particles that freeze within the exposure time typically tens of seconds are identified as IN at the prescribed conditions. This sampling strategy implies that the freezing behavior in the atmosphere is sufficiently well represented by these conditions. Similarly, laboratory-based deterministic parameterizations of N IN are derived by recording the fraction of frozen particles in an ice chamber as a function of T .:  We assume particles with D IN  = 500 nm unless otherwise noted in Figure  1 c that are exposed to prescribed conditions for t  = 100 s unless otherwise noted in Figure  1 d . In Figures  1 a– 1 c, we restrict our analysis to results for 0.1 <  P  < 0.9 since the maximum in S X occurs in this range. At lower or higher P , a change in X leads to only small changes in P ;  S X  → 0 when  P  → 1 or  P  → 0.  S X values outside this P range would occupy the white space between the data points shown and S X  = 0; e.g., at a given T , particles with lower θ freeze faster than t  = 100 s P  > 0.9 whereas those with higher θ require more than 100 s to reach the minimum P 0.1 .Sensitivities of freezing probability P , S X  = ∂ P / ∂ ln X equation 3 based on classical nucleation theory for immersion freezing to a temperature D IN  = 500 nm, t  = 100 s , b contact angle D IN  = 500 nm, t  = 100 s , c IN diameter t  = 100 s , and d time T  = 250 K, D IN  = 500 nm . Patterns in the model data are due to the ranges of selected parameters and incomplete sampling of the parameter space. e S T p for four IN populations that exhibit IN size D IN,g , σ DIN and contact angle distributions θ g , σ θ t  = 100 s ; f S t p for the same distributions T  = 254 K . Note that for Figures  1 e and 1 f, all S X p are shown whereas for Figures  1 a– 1 d, only absolute maximum S X values 0.1 <  P  < 0.9 are displayed. In order to generalize our results, we calculate sensitivities for particle populations S X p that exhibit wide D IN and θ ranges, characterized by geometric mean values D IN,g and θ g , and geometric standard deviations σ DIN and σ θ . For populations, P is calculated as the sum of individual P D IN , θ , weighted by the relative contributions of the individual D IN and θ to the two distributions. Overall S T p Figure  1 e and S t p Figure  1 f are smaller than those in Figures  1 a and 1 d because we include all P D IN ,θ values and by definition S X  = 0 if P ~0 or P ~1. S T p values are very sensitive to σ θ , all else equal red and blue lines; Figure  1 e with the highest S T p for the narrowest θ distribution. For such distributions, S T p and S T are of the same order of magnitude. Maximum | S T p | values occur at the same T where θ , T data pairs for S T are predicted for the most frequent θ values in the distribution θ ~50° ± 10° at ~254 K . Different D IN distributions but identical θ distributions red and black lines in Figure  1 e lead to very similar S T p , which confirms our finding that D IN does not greatly affect P Figure  1 c . All four particle populations show constant S t p over a wide t range. As in the case of S T p , the highest S t p is found for narrow θ distributions, i.e., when a large fraction of particles has P ~ e -1 and can significantly change P at a given T blue line . Overall, the trends in Figures  1 e and 1 f confirm results in Figures  1 a and 1 d: While absolute values for S X p are smaller, the ratio of the sensitivities is robust, i.e., S T p / S t p  ~ S T / S t ~10 4 . At T ~269 K, Δ T + 0.4 K achieves the same change in P from P 1 to P 2 as Δ θ + 1.2° or D IN 1 / D IN 2 ~6, or t 1 / t 2 ~7000. At the lowest T case III, T ~246 K , the corresponding ranges required to change P 1 to P 2 are Δ T ~2.1 K, Δ θ  ~5.7°, or a decrease in D IN by a factor 20. This trend is in agreement with the lower sensitivity at lower T Figure  1 ; i.e., a larger variation in X is needed in order to cause the change from P 1 to P 2 . In all cases, a very large range in t t 1 /t 2 ~7000, with little 2% sensitivity to T is required to change P 1 to P 2 . This reinforces the weak sensitivity of P to t . The weaker sensitivity of T , D IN , and θ at lower T suggests that the sensitivity to t might become relatively more important at low T . However, one should keep in mind that S t is always smaller by several orders of magnitude than S T and S θ . The values in Table  1 allow us to derive some empirical relationships to compare sensitivities in terms of absolute numbers. In all three T regimes, the change in θ is within 2 · Δ Τ , it can be concluded that only a small fraction of a particle population of a given IN type characterized by a θ distribution might be affected by such T variability.. P is expressed as a function of the density of INAS n s is replaced by J  ′  The logarithm of n s T values shows an approximate linear increase with decreasing T with the slope dependent on the IN bulk composition. Keeping to a conceptual analysis, we choose a slope of d log n s / d T ~0.4 / K, which is approximately the slope found for kaolinite. We do not attempt to reproduce data accurately but present the values of θ that fulfill equation 6 for combinations of values of D IN , t , and T , and for three different T values along a line with this slope Table  2 .. It should be noted that this analysis refers only to the equivalency in equation 6 ; P in both approaches should show a similar sensitivity to A as in Figure  1 c. The θ required to match n s increases with decreasing T . This trend confirms that freezing behavior cannot be represented with a single θ per particle. Based on such experimental studies, observed freezing curves P vs. T were fitted to obtain θ distributions over the particle surface area. While the P integrated over the surface of a particle with n nucleation sites P n can be reproduced by a single θ for a given set of T and t , it has been shown that the use of a single θ as compared to multiple ones leads to different N IN  = f   T,t .. The sampling procedure to determine N IN usually involves a CFDC that aspirates particles into a chamber where they are exposed to a preset T for ~10 s., a 100-fold increase in t could cause a similar uncertainty, in particular at high T . Indeed, correlations of predicted and observed N IN show highest deviations at high T . This fact could either be explained by the higher sensitivity or simply by the much lower N IN that exist at high T N IN bacteria  ≪  N IN dust . A more sophisticated N IN parameterization for deposition/condensation freezing includes different IN types i.e., some measure for θ distributions , in addition to D IN and T . Given the large uncertainty associated with ambient IN measurements, the small variability caused by different exposure times can likely be neglected.. The authors suggest that CFDC measurements might significantly underestimate the true N IN . Based on our analysis, we estimate that differences of five orders of magnitude in t 10 s vs. 1 day are equivalent to a change of Δ T ~ –2 K at T ~258 K, i.e., the approximate T of the observed clouds . Even though the average T within the cloud might have been constant, small-scale fluctuations could have caused the observed increase in N IN . While our findings based on CNT analysis could explain the observed behavior, other effects might also be responsible for an apparent continuous freezing. For example, physicochemical modification of IN during exposure to ambient conditions could cause changes in θ and possibly to a lesser extent in D IN and enhance the IN ability of particles.[21]  Sensitivity studies of classical nucleation theory CNT reveal that variabilities in time t and ice nucleus diameter D IN have less impact on the frozen fraction P than variations in temperature T and surface properties contact angle θ . In general, all sensitivities decrease with decreasing T . Case studies show that a change in T of ~1 K has a similar impact on P as θ changes of Δ θ  = 2° whereas a similar change is only caused by an increase in D IN by one order of magnitude, or in t by three orders of magnitude. This high sensitivity to T can explain the feasibility of empirical expressions that neglect t as a controlling parameter. The weak sensitivity to t suggests that common IN samplers might only miss a small fraction of particles by restricting the sample time to a few seconds. Small uncertainties in T in the instrument might significantly bias the sampling; e.g., an uncertainty of Δ T ±0.2 K translates to the same uncertainty as differences in t of about two orders of magnitude. We show that sensitivity trends for single particles one D IN and θ also hold for IN populations that cover ranges of D IN and θ distributions. While most expressions that predict ice number concentrations as currently implemented in models are empirically based, it seems feasible to develop more physically CNT based relationships that include T , D IN , and IN type i.e., θ range . Assuming different values for time over atmospherically relevant ranges will only lead to minor differences in the parameterization coefficients."
49,dust aerosol,"Toward resolution-independent dust emissions in global models: Impacts on the seasonal and spatial distribution of dust. Simulating the emission of mineral dust and sea-salt aerosol is nonlinear with surface winds and therefore requires accurate representation of surface winds. Consequently, the resolution of a simulation affects emission and is often corrected with nonphysical scaling in coarse resolution global models. We examine the resolution dependence of emissions in the GEOS-Chem model and find that globally, annual emissions at 4 degrees x 5 degrees resolution are 59% of those simulated at 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees and only 33% of emissions at 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees. The spatial and seasonal distribution of dust emissions vary substantially, indicating that applying a uniform scaling is inappropriate. We demonstrate the benefit of characterizing the subgrid surface wind as a Weibull probability distribution, reconciling much of the difference in emissions between resolutions for dust. Such a representation is shown to have little impact on sea-salt emissions.  The resolution of a simulation will affect the result for processes that have a nonlinear dependence on meteorological fields, such as wind-driven aerosol emission. This can be expressed with the following inequality, where, 2003 . We explore two possible solutions to the resolution dependence of the emissions: 1 to treat u ∗ 3 as a separate variable when averaging the high-resolution winds to coarser resolutions addressing the inequality expressed above “cubed wind” and 2 to represent the grid box wind with a probability distribution accounting for emission when the mean wind is below the threshold “wind PDF” . The probability distribution for surface wind speeds can be represented by a Weibull distribution and has been shown to hold for the scales considered in this study Cakmur et al ., 2004 . From Justus et al . 1978 equations 1 and 13 , we derive the Weibull distribution in nondimensional form, The range for a ±1 ms −1 change in the assumed threshold wind speed for dust uplift is indicated. The six simulations that are performed online are highlighted in bold. Figure  2 illustrates the spatial differences in AOD between simulations over Africa for March. Much of the AOD results from dust emitted in the Bodélé Depression indicated by the white rectangle and transported south-west. The wind PDF increases emissions for both the 4° × 5° and 2 × 2.5° resolution simulations in this region, with the former changing more dramatically. This reduces the bias in March emissions between the two resolutions from 1.55 to 1.00 in the Bodélé Depression and from 1.32 to 1.01 over North Africa, improving agreement in AOD. This is notable as the Bodélé Depression produces almost 20% of the simulated annual African dust aerosol and is difficult to resolve in global models Washington et al ., 2009 .The GEOS-Chem dust AOD over Africa for March 2012 is shown for left 4° × 5° and right 2° × 2.5° resolutions and for top and bottom, respectively both the standard and wind PDF simulations. Total monthly dust emissions for North Africa are displayed, and the Bodélé Depression is marked with the white rectangle. Sea-salt emissions are also nonlinearly dependent on surface wind speeds. The GEOS-Chem simulation of sea-salt emissions is based on Gong 2003 with updates from Jaegle et al . 2010 . As with mineral dust, we calculate the sea-salt emissions at 4° × 5° and 2° × 2.5° resolution, using the mean 10-m wind, the high-resolution wind to the power 3.41 called “U341 field” and using the wind PDF. We also test the application of a wind speed threshold, suggested to range between 3 and 5 ms −1 by Lewis and Schwartz 2004 and find only a 0.2% decrease in the total global emissions for a 4 ms −1 threshold, indicating that this is regularly exceeded. These results suggest that using no wind threshold for sea-salt emission in global models is a reasonable simplification. We conclude that, unlike mineral dust emissions, sea-salt emissions are relatively independent of model resolution. The uniform soil texture and surface roughness assumed in the model will reduce the sensitivity to land surface properties. Fidelity of dust emission may benefit from better representation of these properties and consideration of their subgrid distribution, e.g., soil moisture that can follow a power law distribution Rodriguez-Iturbe et al ., 1995 . Also, dust emissions from convective processes e.g., Haboobs are not well captured in coarse resolution simulations; additional parameterizations may be necessary to adequately represent these sources of dust aerosol in global models.[18]  While we have focused on aerosol emission, the choice of model resolution has been shown to affect other processes within global models, for example, secondary organic aerosol production Wainwright et al ., 2012 and estimation of the direct radiative effect via hygroscopic growth of aerosol Bian et al ., 2009 . Reconciliation of differences due to model resolution may be realized for other processes within global models by using a similar approach as this study. While high-resolution simulations may be necessary for some applications, this study illustrates that using a simple representation of subgrid properties in a global model yields sensible results at coarse resolution and for relatively little computational expense."
51,atmosphere clouds,"The semidiurnal tide in the middle atmosphere of Mars. Atmospheric thermal tides are global oscillations in atmospheric fields that are subharmonics of a solar day. While atmospheric tides on Earth are mainly relevant in the upper atmosphere, on Mars, they dominate temperature variations and winds throughout the atmosphere. Observations and model simulations to date have suggested that the migrating diurnal tide is the predominant mode in the Martian atmosphere, and that the semidiurnal tide is only relevant in the tropical middle atmosphere during conditions of high dust loading. New comprehensive observations by the Mars Climate Sounder in a geometry that allows coverage of multiple local times show that the semidiurnal tide is a dominant response of the Martian atmosphere throughout the Martian year. The maximum semidiurnal amplitude of similar to 16 K is found at southern winter high latitudes, which makes it the largest tidal amplitude observed in the Martian middle atmosphere outside of dust storm conditions. The semidiurnal tide can be successfully modeled due to recent advances of Mars General Circulation Models MGCMs that include the radiatively active treatment of water ice clouds. Tidal forcing occurs through absorption of radiation by aerosols and points to the vertical structure of dust and clouds and their radiative effects as being essential for our understanding of the thermal structure and the general circulation of the Martian atmosphere. As with terrestrial GCMs trying to quantify mechanisms affecting climate, future Mars modeling efforts will require microphysical schemes to control aerosol distributions, and vertically and temporally resolved measurements of temperature and aerosols will be essential for their validation. , on Mars, they dominate temperature variations and winds throughout the atmosphere, and they can have a significant influence on the general atmospheric circulation. In this work, we focus on the migrating thermal tide, which is zonally symmetric in a fixed local time reference frame, in contrast to nonmigrating tide components, which occur through interaction with the zonal structure of planetary topography, thermal inertia, and albedo., depending on the thermal inertia of the surface. The heat flux from the surface causes changes in temperature and pressure in the lowermost atmosphere. The propagation of these changes gives rise to global oscillations in atmospheric pressure, temperature, and wind called atmospheric tides. Due to the nature of the forcing, the most prominent mode is the diurnal tide, although higher-order modes are also excited. Distributing the heating over a larger part of the atmosphere, e.g., due to suspended aerosol, strengthens contributions of the semidiurnal tide, which has a period of half a solar day. Due to its long vertical wavelength, it responds well to forcing that extends over a large altitude range.. In addition, vertical oscillations observed in temperature profiles derived from the atmospheric entry of landers were attributed to the influence of the diurnal tide.. During large dust storms, the amplitude was observed to exceed 8 K. The diurnal tide was also identified using the data obtained during the MGS mapping period, although only two local times were sampled due to the sun-synchronous orbit, which causes aliasing of higher-order modes into the diurnal response. to expand the available MCS data, Lee et al . found that the diurnal tide had an amplitude of 8.5 K at a pressure level of 2 Pa in the season around L s = 150°, and that the highest amplitudes can reach up to 12 K in the equinoctial seasons. The diurnal tide in the Martian atmosphere has been shown to be well modeled by both classical tidal theory and Mars General Circulation Models MGCMs .. Wilson and Richardson performed a reanalysis of Viking data in which they suggested a spectral leak in the 15 µm channel of the Infrared Thermal Mapper and showed that the observations were consistent with a semidiurnal tide in the tropical middle atmosphere if this effect was taken into account. While in a clear atmosphere, the diurnal tide was found to be dominant in the Martian tropics, the amplitude of the semidiurnal tide increased with increasing dust loading as solar heating is not confined to the surface anymore but becomes distributed over a larger part of the atmosphere. Based on a linear tidal model, Wilson and Richardson suggested that the semidiurnal tide becomes the dominant component above moderate dust loadings τ  > 1 . Components of the semidiurnal tide were also derived from TES data during aerobraking and science phasing; however, data are limited to the southern hemisphere, typically poleward of 20°S. A single fit suggested a maximum amplitude of the order of 8 K at low latitudes during the dusty season L s = 255–270° at an altitude of 3–4 scale heights. In other regions and seasons, the semidiurnal component tended to be much smaller, typically around 1 K. The semidiurnal tide has also been modeled; however, significant contributions to the temperature structure of the middle atmosphere have always been associated with enhanced dust conditions., an infrared thermal emission radiometer on board MRO. MCS observes the Martian surface and atmosphere with eight infrared spectral channels and one visible/near-infrared channel. Each channel has a 21-element linear detector array. When pointed at the Mars limb, radiance profiles are measured simultaneously, from which vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature, dust, and water ice opacity are retrieved. The retrievals give profile information up to ~ 80 km altitude with a vertical resolution of ~ 5 km. The observations were performed in campaigns of about 4 weeks duration, interspersed with periods of regular in-track scanning. Between September 2010 and May 2012, 11 campaigns were executed, covering one Mars year. Their time periods are given in Table  1 .. Temperature profiles were averaged on the pressure levels defined by the MCS retrieval, which have a spacing of one eight of a scale height.. A strong semidiurnal signature can be seen between 5 and 0.1 Pa in southern high latitudes, characterized by temperature maxima around local midnight and local noon at higher altitudes, and somewhat later at lower altitudes. Equatorial latitudes exhibit a diurnal tide with a vertical shift in the phase that is consistent with a vertically propagating gravity wave, as suggested by theory. A temperature maximum around 0.65 sols ~3:30 P.M. local time between 20 and 2 Pa, which is surrounded by lower temperatures toward local noon and later in the afternoon, also suggests a semidiurnal contribution in this altitude range. The longitudinal structure of the temperature fields Figures 1 and 2 in supplementary materials is dominated by a stationary wave at mid-latitudes. top Zonally averaged temperature and center temperature deviation from the diurnally averaged temperature profile versus local time scale in sols on bottom, scale in 1 24 of a sol on top, 1 sol = 1 Martian day ≈ 24.6 terrestrial hours for left southern high latitudes and right the equatorial region at L s = 101°–114° of MY 31. Black tick marks give the positions of the individual local time bins. The bottom panel gives the temperature deviation for these latitude bands as calculated from fits see text . To estimate the error in the fit on each pressure level, fits to the local time dependence of temperature were performed with each zonal mean temperature perturbed by its standard error. The distribution of positive and negative perturbations was based on a power set. With typically six local time bins for each fit, 2 6 combinations of perturbations were investigated. The maximum deviation of any fitted quantity from the fit without perturbation is reported as error; hence, it has the character of a maximum error rather than a propagated standard deviation.. It is vertically propagating as indicated by the phase variation, consistent with theory and modeling. There is a reversal in the phase variation with height between 0.5 and 0.2 Pa. Around 20°N–30°N, the diurnal tide in the middle atmosphere changes phase, as expected for this season, and shows the typical growth of the amplitude with height. The amplitude of the semidiurnal component is fitted with a magnitude comparable to the diurnal component. The slow variation of the phase with altitude suggests a long vertical wavelength, consistent with classical tidal theory, which indicates that the migrating semidiurnal tide is dominated by a single Hough mode H 2,2 with a broad meridional distribution and a long vertical wavelength. However, due to the uneven coverage in local time at low latitudes, an uncertainty of up to 5 K is estimated for the semidiurnal component in these regions Figure  3 in supplementary materials . In the southern winter season, the semidiurnal tide is strong at pressures below 1 Pa south of ~50°S. The maximum tidal amplitude is hence located at a lower pressure than the temperature maximum in the polar winter region. The phase moves through about a third of a day between ~ 2 and 0.1 Pa, corresponding to a vertical wavelength of about 70 km.Top: Zonally averaged temperature versus latitude from fits for L s = 101°–114°. Black tick marks give the positions of the individual latitude bins. Center and bottom: Amplitude contours in 2 K increments and phase colors of the center diurnal and bottom semidiurnal migrating tide versus latitude for this season. At northern high latitudes, the semidiurnal tide is present during the other half of the Martian year L s ≈ 180°–360° . The maximum amplitude of about 13 K is observed around L s = 300°, with a maximum error around 2 K. However, higher amplitudes could occur closer to the pole, where steep horizontal gradients often prevent reliable retrievals. The tidal maximum seems to occur at slightly lower pressures than in the south. The phase of the tide is comparable to its southern counterpart.. To investigate its source, we employ the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GFDL MGCM, which has been extensively used to examine tides and planetary waves and cloud radiative effects. The model is run with a horizontal resolution of 2.8° × 2.8°. The vertical dimension is represented by a hybrid sigma/pressure grid with 36 vertical layers extending to 0.004 Pa ~95 km . The model includes surface and subsurface physics which allow the calculation of realistic surface temperatures; a budget for gaseous and condensed CO 2 which yields a realistic annual cycle of global atmospheric mass, solar, and infrared radiative transfer for gaseous CO 2 and atmospheric aerosols; and aerosol transport which allows for a self-consistent simulation of the aerosol distribution., which transports cloud ice mass and predicts a spatially varying mean cloud particle size. In order to explore the radiative impact of the clouds, we have included a scaling constant CR that determines the cloud opacity seen by the radiation code, and so it is straightforward to switch between simulations with radiatively passive CR = 0 and radiatively active clouds CR > 0 . We have considered two key simulations to aid in the interpretation of the MCS observations. For the baseline model configuration, the vertical distribution of dust varies spatially and temporally due to advection in the model, but the column amount is tied to a column dust opacity corresponding to that observed by MGS TES between L s = 150° in MY 24 and L s = 150° in MY 25. In the baseline simulation, clouds are radiatively passive. The other simulation differs only by the presence of radiatively active clouds RAC . The model tends to overpredict water ice cloud opacity, so we have reduced the cloud opacity in the radiation code by setting CR = 0.5. This strategy of adjusting the radiative impact of the simulated clouds is adequate to explore the impact of radiative forcing on middle atmospheric temperatures. and is likely related to the effect of background zonal mean winds. The simulated tropical response shows a significant semidiurnal tide, though the amplitude of the semidiurnal component in the lower atmosphere 50–10 Pa is weaker than suggested in Figures  2 and 3 see Figure 6 in supplementary materials . However, the model semidiurnal tide of ~4 K is consistent with the measured amplitude of 6–8 K after taking the measurement uncertainty of 4–5 K into account. By contrast, the baseline simulation yields a tropical semidiurnal amplitude of 1–2 K.Simulations by the GFDL MGCM of the local time variation of temperature anomaly for left southern high latitudes and right the equatorial region for L s = 105°. Simulations in the top panel were performed without radiatively active clouds, while in the bottom panel, radiatively active clouds were turned on., which were not observed during the time period studied here and which would be particularly untypical for the southern winter season. To investigate the influence of isolated dust layers, as suggested by recent MCS observations, sensitivity studies were carried out without RAC but with a parameterization of an equatorial dust layer centered around 30–50 Pa. Simulations with dust layer opacities sufficient to force a semidiurnal tide response comparable to the one observed tended to yield unrealistically warm temperatures around 10–50 Pa not shown . In contrast, water ice clouds with a large vertical extent in the middle atmosphere have been recently observed by MCS and provide a viable source for the tidal forcing. Although dust layers could provide an additional contribution to the forcing, our sensitivity studies suggest that water ice clouds are more effective in producing the observed semidiurnal tide. The modeled semidiurnal tidal amplitudes are largely consistent with the tidal fits performed by Banfield et al ., which were not understood at the time, and were significantly larger than could be accounted for by dust forcing.. RAC has been shown to improve modeling of the vertical temperature structure of the atmosphere, in particular in the equatorial region during the aphelion season. Wilson shows that RAC improves the simulation of the tropical temperature structure seen in MCS data., a region soon to be investigated by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission. As cloud distribution in the Martian atmosphere is modulated by tides, this leads to a feedback loop between clouds and tidal response. Atmospheric tides and their forcing have a significant influence on the atmospheric circulation. Including RAC into the model strengthens the overturning meridional circulation and raises the temperature maximum in the polar winter middle atmosphere Figure 6 in supplementary materials , which addresses a deficit in MGCMs pointed out by MCS observations. Future modeling efforts will require the distributions of cloud and dust to be controlled with detailed microphysical schemes for accurately modeling the tidal field and hence the global temperature structure and general circulation of the Martian atmosphere. This is comparable to the current challenges faced by terrestrial GCMs, which require modeling of cloud and aerosol microphysics to quantify effects on climate. and Takahashi et al .. Future measurements of the tidal structure by MCS in Mars years with different aerosol loadings are expected to give more detailed insight into the interactions between the vertical structure of aerosols and the atmospheric temperature field and will provide valuable information for improving MGCMs. Future missions with instrumentation for atmospheric investigations of the red planet should consider orbit geometries that allow coverage of multiple times of day to enable more comprehensive studies of the diurnal variations of the atmospheric temperature field and the distribution of cloud and dust aerosols."
52,dust particles aerosol,"Impact of atmospheric transport on the evolution of microphysical and optical properties of Saharan dust. Saharan dust affects the climate by altering the radiation balance and by depositing minerals to the Atlantic Ocean. Both are dependent on particle size. We present aircraft measurements comprising 42 profiles of size distribution 0.1-300 mu m , representing freshly uplifted dust, regional aged dust, and dust in the Saharan Air Layer SAL over the Canary Islands. The mean effective diameter of dust in SAL profiles is 4.5 mu m smaller than that in freshly uplifted dust, while the vertical structure changes from a low shallow layer 0-1.5km to a well-mixed deep Saharan dust layer 0-5km . Size distributions show a loss of 60 to 90% of particles larger than 30 mu m 12h after uplift. The single scattering albedo SSA increases from 0.92 to 0.94 to 0.95 between fresh, aged, and SAL profiles: this is enough to alter heating rates by 26%. Some fresh dust close to the surface shows SSA as low as 0.85. . Dust laden air influences weather and climate by modifying the radiation balance, which can impact atmospheric circulation and surface temperatures over desert and ocean. These radiative interactions are sensitive to dust size and optical properties. Additionally, the amount of soluble iron in ocean-deposited dust can be dependent on particle size.. Additionally, relatively few measurements are available for use in evaluating models which describe how dust properties depend on distance from source, particularly close to uplift time. Such measurements are needed to accurately model the impact on climate, and additionally to validate dust schemes in climate and numerical weather prediction models. Much recent work has explored the meteorological mechanisms behind dust uplift and transport over the Sahara, such as diurnal mixing of low-level jets to the surface and cold pool outflows from moist convection haboobs as reviewed by Knippertz and Todd . However, accompanying work on the associated changes in dust microphysical and optical properties and their vertical distribution during these processes and particularly in subsequent transport has been sparse to date. examined change in dust size distribution with transport across the Atlantic Ocean, but the measurements in the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico were taken 5 years apart, and being ground-based were unable to provide vertically resolved measurements. Weinzierl et al . compared airborne dust size distributions between Morocco and Cape Verde, but measurements were taken during different years and seasons. Various aircraft measurements of dust over the eastern Atlantic have been made over the last 15 years but repeated and consistent comparisons of dust profiles over ocean and desert are not available. Hence, Prospero and Mayol-Bracero and Ansmann et al . emphasize the need for an improved understanding of changes in dust properties during transport. Here we address this issue using new aircraft profile measurements at different stages of the dust lifecycle over Africa and the Eastern Atlantic., the UK's BAe-146-301 Research Aircraft operated by the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements was stationed at Fuerteventura, Canary Islands from 17 to 28 June 2011. During missions conducted over the Sahara Aerosol Optical Depths AODs , up to 3.1 at 550 nm, calculated from airborne scattering and absorption measurements were measured. During the same time period, two Saharan dust outbreaks over the Canary Islands occurred with AODs up to 1.1. As a consequence, the aircraft sampled the vertical profile of dust over both the Sahara Mauritania and Mali and the eastern Atlantic Ocean, between the African coast and Fuerteventura, through ascents and descents as part of the flight track. In total, 42 profiles were performed see supporting information for full details and flight tracks . Over ocean, profiles were sampled from the surface to cruising altitude around 8 km , whereas over the desert, the aircraft minimum altitude varied between 100 m to 1 km above ground level.. Size ranges for each instrument are slightly different to the full size range available and are selected here to provide a complete but not overlapping size distribution of the mid points of the size bins, which results in the bin edges overlapping slightly. Henceforth, all size measurements refer to diameter d . The single scattering albedo is particularly sensitive to choice of refractive index. We solely present data regarding size distributions; chemical composition and particle shape are not included in the analysis. Locations are selected where number concentrations were larger than 10 cm −3 to ensure dust was present, and measurements within clouds were excluded based on relative humidity and particle number concentrations recorded by the CDP. examined measurements from horizontal flight legs, calculating dust age based on Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager SEVIRI RGB 15 min resolution satellite imagery and HYSPLIT back trajectories. Here we use profile measurements which correspond to the same cases. We combine the two fresh categories of Ryder et al . into a single “fresh desert” category, consisting of five profiles, representing dust uplifted within 12 h prior to measurement. We combine all other profiles measured over desert into an “aged desert” category 15 profiles , where dust has been mobilized 12 to 70 h prior to measurement, with sources in central and eastern Algeria, and in central north Mali for one case flight b604 .. Dust uplift potential is calculated along 7 day kinematic back-trajectories when the air mass was within the boundary layer, using European Centre Medium Range Weather Forecast meteorological analysis data. This provides an insight into both times and locations when surface winds were strong enough for dust uplift. The results indicate that the SAL dust was at least 18 h old, with a mean and median “age” of 87 and 77 h, respectively. Likely sources were mainly over Western Sahara, northern Mauritania, and eastern and central Algeria. Additional assessments using SEVIRI images and HYSPLIT back trajectories implied similar dust uplift locations and ages. Thus, it seems that the dust measured over the ocean probably had largely similar source locations as the desert measurements, although from forward calculations not shown , we cannot confirm direct Lagrangian transport of dust sampled over the desert to the SAL profiles . For fresh desert cases, a decrease in number concentration with altitude at all particle size ranges is evident, particularly beneath 2 km. This is consistent with freshly uplifted dust at the surface being mixed through the convective boundary layer CBL , during the morning break down of the low-level jet LLJ, Marsham et al . . As the dust ages, it is mixed vertically upwards through the deep SABL, and vertical profiles become much more constant for the aged desert category green lines in Figures  1 a and 1 b , and also the SAL profiles blue lines . While d eff decreases with altitude for the fresh cases, it is relatively constant with altitude for the aged desert and SAL cases, by which time the dust is well mixed within the deep SABL or the SAL. This is also reflected in the volume size distributions Figure in supporting information —fresh desert cases show a decreasing total concentration and contribution of giant particles with altitude whereas aged and SAL profiles show sharp decreases in concentrations at 5 km the top of the SABL and SAL . Figure  2 b shows the fractional change in the normalized number size distributions i.e., divided by total number concentration , between fresh desert and aged desert categories red , and between aged desert and SAL categories green , after Maring et al .. Fairly constant losses of around 20 to 40% of particles sized between 0.4 to 20 µm for both transitions red and green lines are shown, with some variations between the two stages, although they do not emerge outside the error bars. At sizes larger than 20 µm, there is an increase in fractional loss for both lines, consistent with preferential deposition of the largest particles. Between 60 and 90% of particles sized between 30 and 200 µm are lost between fresh and aged desert profiles, i.e., subsequent to 12 h after uplift. One hundred percent of these particles are absent in the SAL profile column mean. Note that the column-mean size distribution over the ocean still has a relatively large coarse mode, with a peak normalized volume size distribution at 10 to 20 µm. found a preferential loss of particles larger than 7.3 µm across the Atlantic from surface measurements. We report fractional losses of 20 to 40% between 4 to 30 µm, whereas losses of Maring et al . were closer to zero. Weinzierl et al . compared dust measurements from different years over Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean, finding that over land particles sized larger than 40 µm were present 20% of the time compared to 0% over the ocean. Results presented here show that the recently observed number concentrations of very large dust particles over the Sahara during the Fennec project are not observed over ocean when probed with the same instrumentation. Clearly, dust size distribution changes very rapidly following dust uplift and close to the African coast. in the absence of turbulence, giant mode particles would fall the 5 km SABL depth within 12.5 ± 4 h. This explains the loss of giant particles between the fresh and aged profiles Figure  1 c in all cases, except for flight b604 where giant particles were transported over longer time scales, perhaps due to overnight turbulence in cold-pool outflow. Deposition also plays a role for coarse mode particles, which fall the same distance over any time from 20 ± 5 h d = 30 µm to several days d = 4 µm . Despite this, coarse mode particles are not completely depleted by either the aged or SAL categories. Accumulation mode particles d < 3.5 µm, to coincide with PCASP measurements are deposited on a time scale lasting tens of days or more, suggesting a lesser role for deposition, even for the Eastern Atlantic SAL profiles.. Therefore, for the transition from aged to SAL, mean time scales are 40 to 80 h, so number concentrations could be expected to decrease by a factor of 2. Measurements between aged and SAL categories decrease by around a factor of 2 and 1.3 for accumulation and coarse modes, respectively, on an order of magnitude in agreement with dispersion theory: the greater loss of accumulation compared with coarse mode is at odds with the greater loss of coarse mode expected from deposition and may result from the lack of an exact Lagrangian match. Dispersion between fresh and aged categories is more difficult to evaluate since source strength varies between dust events and was not measured , and the dust plume is still being mixed vertically throughout the SABL at this stage. All the parameters shown in Figure  3 respond to the decrease in d eff between fresh desert, aged desert, and SAL categories, with an increase in SSA and k ext , and a decrease in g see also Figure in supporting information . This results from the smaller SAL particles being less absorbing, having higher extinction properties per unit mass, and being less forward scattering. Changes between the fresh and aged desert categories are particularly noticeable at low altitudes where the largest particles are present in fresh cases. The column mean beneath 1.5 km changes from 0.92 to 0.94 for SSA, 0.76 to 0.74 for g, and 0.15 to 0.23 m 2 g −1 for k ext , from fresh to aged. For a constant AOD of 1.0, these changes would decrease the instantaneous solar heating rate by 26%. Changes in optical properties at higher altitudes between fresh and aged desert are not obvious due to the similar d eff values shown in Figure  1 d., who found that Stokes velocities alone were not able to explain measured size distributions. It is possible that other mechanisms play a role, such as buoyancy and/or turbulence in the SABL and SAL, or electrostatic charging of particles e.g., Nicoll et al . , or that the lack of direct Lagrangian transport here influenced the results.[26]  Rapid changes in number concentration, size distribution, and optical properties, as shown here, are important for mineral deposition to the Atlantic Ocean and the radiative effect of dust. Thus, it is a challenge to models which include dust to accurately model these changes during transport. Given the dependence of optical properties on size, and the estimated changes of 26% in solar heating rate simply due to SSA changes, studies examining the radiative impact of dust on circulation should use appropriately varying size distributions and dust optical properties. This could be achieved by interactive optical property calculations linked to improved modeled size distribution and evaluated using measurements such as those presented in this study, or at least by using a different radiative description of dust close to the source."
53,climate aerosol ocean,"Direct radiative effects of an unseasonal dust storm at a western Indo Gangetic Plain station Delhi in ultraviolet, shortwave, and longwave regions. The aerosol direct radiative effects DRE in the ultraviolet, shortwave, and longwave range due to an unusual dust storm during 21 March 2012 have been quantified from surface measurements of aerosol optical depth AOD and radiation fluxes at Delhi, a western Indo Gangetic Plain station. The intrusion of dust over Delhi caused an increase in daily average AOD at 500nm from 0.6 to 0.8, with a corresponding decrease in Angstrom exponent from 0.4 to subzero value. The dust severely affected the incoming solar radiation flux in the UV, shortwave, and longwave regions. The DRE at surface in the UV and shortwave regions decreased from -4.6 to -5.9 Wm -2 and from -68 to -86 Wm -2 , respectively, while the longwave DRE increased from 27 to 45 Wm -2 . . Desert mineral dust is the main natural aerosol, on the global scale, that decisively affects the energy balance of climate system. There have been several studies on the aerosol radiative forcing highlighting the effects of mineral dust aerosols, but most of these are limited to the shortwave wavelength region only. This is in spite of the fact that aerosol forcings in the longwave region, as well as ultraviolet UV region, are also important, and neglecting these forcings would cause large errors in climate models, particularly when there is a significant amount of mineral dust aerosols in the atmosphere. The mineral dust aerosols are also known to be good absorbers in the UV region. Studies show that longwave aerosol radiative forcing is even comparable in magnitude to the forcing due to greenhouse gases or that with the shortwave forcing, especially during the mineral dust loading in the atmosphere.. However, there is hardly any study on the effect of dust on the ultraviolet and longwave radiation flux in the region, in spite of the fact that the tropical aerosols are known to cause a large difference in the top of the atmosphere and surface forcings. Recently, there was an unusual dust storm which usually occur during May–June over the northwest Indian region event that started in the western part of Middle East and engulfed the IGP region reaching Delhi on 21 March 2012. The cause of this intense dust storm seems to be the convergence of two different fronts, front that carried dust from Iraq and Kuwait and the dust laden front from the southeastern Iran. The MODIS Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on NASA's Terra satellite image of 19 March showing the spatial sweep of the dust event across Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan is shown in Figure  1 a. The plumes from the storm were thick enough to completely obstruct the visibility of the land and water surfaces below, and they have traversed thousands of kilometers from the Red Sea to Afghanistan and from the Arabian Peninsula to India. Figure  1 b shows the transport of dust plume on 20 March across the Arabian Sea to reach India. a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS on NASA's Terra satellite image of the dust storm across Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan on 19 March 2012. b The image on 21 March showing the transport of dust plume across Arabian Sea to reach western Indo Gangetic Plain.. More details of the instrument and data analysis procedures may be found elsewhere. The collocated measurements of the global surface flux and aerosol optical depth are used first to obtain the aerosol direct radiative forcing efficiency at the observation site in the three wavelength bands. For the forcing estimations, we have employed the differential method, which assumes that changes in the global irradiance in a spectral band are assumed as due to the changes in aerosol loading. In order to do this, a reference day among the clear-sky days for the whole month of March 2012 was chosen based on the lowest mean aerosol optical depth at 500 nm. The 24 h average surface fluxes in different bands for the reference day lowest AOD day were subtracted correspondingly from the average fluxes for the rest of the days. The aerosol forcing efficiency was then calculated from the slope of the best fit line between daily mean surface flux and the corresponding mean aerosol optical depths. The forcing efficiency when multiplied with the average aerosol optical depth gives rise to the observed direct radiative effects DRE at the surface. This method is rather robust over the conventional method using radiative transfer models as this is neither sensitive to calibration uncertainties nor model assumptions. The maximum change in direct flux due to the changes in the eccentricity parameter Sun-Earth distance and declination angle is found to be less than 2%. The total uncertainty in DRE estimates in this approach is also small and is reported to be ~ 7%., also clearly demonstrates the prevalence of dust dominance in the atmosphere as evident from the negative value of α and higher value of AOD. The reversal in the spectral dependences leading to negative values of α occurs usually during the periods of severe dust storms in the vicinity of the measurement location. In the present case, α values decreased from 0.43 on 19 March to −0.02 on 21 March due to the dust intrusion.Time series of a AOD 500 nm and b Angstrom parameter α from 19 to 23 March 2012. The impact of the dust event is observed in 21 March.. The significant peak observed in the DLR on 21 March, despite the fact that both the temperature and humidity showed a decrease, is possible due to the emissions from dust in longwave region. The sudden fall in DLR soon after the event might be attributed to the fall in atmospheric temperatures and relative humidity Figure  2 .Temporal variation of the surface fluxes at a ultraviolet, b shortwave, and c longwave regions from 19 to 23 March 2012 at Delhi.. We have also observed a large increase in the longwave DRE LW as high as ~ 45 Wm −2 on 21 March in comparison with control day ~27 Wm −2 . Similar values of longwave forcing of the order of 42 Wm −2 have been observed recently during a Saharan dust event at Lampedusa. The DRE UV also shows a change from −4.6 to −5.9 Wm −2 from control day to the dusty event day. Thus, we can see a change of 28% in DRE UV , 26% in DRE SW , and 40% in DRE LW due to the intrusion of dust over Delhi during the dust event.The measured aerosol direct radiative effect at the surface at a UV, b shortwave, and c longwave regions from 19 to 23 March 2012.. Further, the longwave DRE due to dust aerosols at Delhi is found to offset the shortwave DRE by about 50%. A somewhat similar offset of shortwave forcing due to longwave was also observed in the Arabian Sea region. However, an offset of only 25% was observed at Pune, a site devoid of desert dust aerosols.[16]  The study of an unusual dust storm on 21 March 2012 in the western IGP region at Delhi has revealed marked changes in the AOD, the surface flux, and the direct radiative effects of aerosol at surface in the ultraviolet, short, and long wavelength regions. The results can be summarized as follows:[17]  The dust intrusion caused an increase in AOD at 500 nm from 0.58 to 0.74 and a subsequent decrease in Angstrom exponent α from 0.43 to −0.02.[18]  The diurnal averaged downwelling ultraviolet and shortwave flux decreased from 9 to 7 Wm −2 peak flux decreased from 36 to 25 Wm −2 and 221 to 199 Wm −2 peak flux decreased from 844 to 714 Wm −2 , respectively, whereas the downwelling longwave flux increased from 376 to 385 Wm −2 due to the dust storm.[19]  It was found that the DRE UV decreased by 28% from −4.6 to −5.9 Wm −2 , and DRE SW decreased by 26% from −68 to −86 Wm −2 . About a 40% increase in DRE LW from 27 to 45 Wm −2 was also observed at Delhi during the dust event."
54,climate ocean,"Iron speciation in aerosol dust influences iron bioavailability over glacial-interglacial timescales. Iron deposition influences primary production and oceanic sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide CO2 . Iron has two oxidation states, Fe II and Fe III , with Fe II being more soluble and available for oceanic phytoplankton uptake. The past proportions of soluble iron in aerosol dust remain unknown. Here we present iron speciation Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the Antarctic Talos Dome ice core over millennial time scales. We demonstrate that iron speciation over the last 55 kyr is linked to increasing quantities of fine dust FD 0.75 mu m and intensified long-range dust transport. We propose that Fe II and Fe2+ production is principally enhanced in FD by photoreduction, although pH and organic complexation may also contribute to the speciation dynamics. During the Last Glacial Maximum, Fe2+ concentrations in dust increased by up to seven times more than interglacial levels, while Fe3+ only doubled. Cold and dusty climatic periods may increase the percentage of biologically available Fe II and Fe2+ deposited in the nutrient-limited Southern Ocean, allowing greater phytoplankton uptake and perhaps increased CO2 drawdown.  due to its ability to limit the biomass of phytoplankton populations in large oceanic zones and consequent atmospheric carbon dioxide CO 2 drawdown. The artificial addition of iron to equatorial Pacific Ocean waters IronEx and the polar Southern Ocean SOIREE resulted in significant increases in phytoplankton productivity and abundance. Recent ocean fertilization experiments confirm that phytoplankton blooms caused by iron addition draw down considerable CO 2 . However, uncertainty remains regarding the net consequence of this biological pump on the atmospheric system and the extent to which iron controls this mechanism over glacial-interglacial cycles.. Changes in the concentrations of many elements, including iron, have been studied in Antarctic sites, such as Dome C 75°06′S, 123°24′E; 3234 MASL and Vostok 78°27′S, 106°50′E; 3488 MASL . Iron speciation presents additional analytical challenges, and this is the first study to quantify iron species in any ice core. We determined iron speciation Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ in Talos Dome TD 159°04′21″E, 72°47′14″S; 2315 MASL ice core samples using flow injection analysis coupled with collision/reaction cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry FIA-CRC-ICP-MS to provide the first evaluation of iron speciation between glacial and interglacial climates with implications for carbon sequestration over millennial time scales., with Fe II species being more soluble and bioavailable than Fe III . Organic complexation may also strongly affect the solubility of iron and the oxidation rate of Fe II . Marine algae more readily take up soluble iron, yet the fraction of soluble iron present in aerosol dust is still unknown. Observations demonstrate that dust origin influences the soluble iron fraction, with dust particles from arid desert soils presenting lower solubility compared to glacially weathered soils. Baker and Jickells proposed that iron solubility is not fixed and changes predictably as an inverse function of dust concentration on both spatial and temporal scales, while Zhuang et al . reported a change in iron speciation due to atmospheric travel time, with an increase in Fe II and solubility associated with remote sources. Long-range atmospheric transport strongly influences iron speciation, enriches Fe II by 50%–100% with respect to total source iron, and increases solubility by a factor of 5–17. Variations in Antarctic iron concentrations are strongly linked to dust deposition and transport, where large-size particles 5–20 µm are predominant during interglacials, while fine dust FD 0.7–5 µm particles become predominant during glacials, indicating changes in the dust provenance and the travel time. Although the net effect of glacial dust flux changes on oceanic primary productivity is still unclear, syntheses conclude that this mechanism may account for 20 to 40 ppmv of the 80–100 ppmv CO 2 changes observed over glacial-interglacial transitions.. The ice sections were transported in a frozen state to the University of Venice and cut into 2 × 3 × 3 cm pieces using a modified commercial band saw and decontaminated using a rinsing technique. Iron speciation was determined by FIA-CRC-ICP-MS as described in detail by Spolaor et al .. This method enables the determination of leachable Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ in ice core samples using a Ni-NTA Superflow chelating system to separate the Fe species. At pH 2, the resin completely retains Fe 3+ with no retention of Fe 2+ . After isolating and determining Fe 3+ , we oxidized the Fe 2+ using H 2 O 2 and determined the Fe 2+ concentration as the difference between the two measurements. The samples were kept frozen at −20°C until immediately prior to analysis due to the rapid oxidation of Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ in liquid samples.. For each 1 m long ice sample, 15 mL was collected in Coulter Counter accuvettes at a rate of 0.5 mL/min. The sample preparation and analytical methods have been previously reported. Melted samples were acidified to pH 1 using sub-boiled distilled HNO 3 Romil, Cambridge, UK and analyzed at least 24 h later by sector field ICP-MS Finnigan™ ELEMENT2, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Bremen, Germany coupled to an APEX Q desolvating introduction unit Elemental Scientific, Omaha, Nebraska, USA . The detection limit, defined as three times the standard deviation of the instrument blank, was 0.029 ng g −1 , with precisions of 16% for Holocene samples and 10% for Last Glacial Maximum LGM samples. We use the methods published by Gaspari et al . to report acid-leachable Fe concentrations, although it has been demonstrated that 1 month is required to completely dissolve Fe-bearing aerosol particles. The time period integrated by each sample varies from approximately 15 yr at 0.6 kyr before present BP; 1950 CE to 150 yr at 55 kyr BP. We compare our data to dust concentrations and particle size distributions in parallel sample aliquots., while the southern ocean is also influenced by other iron sources, including icebergs, subglacial meltwater and upwelling water masses. For Antarctic ice, sodium is widely used as a proxy for marine salt influxes. The ratio of total iron content to total FD load is shown in Figure  2 , as is a smoothing spline reconstruction. We observe that there is little change in the ratio of iron to dust at TD, particularly over glacial-interglacial time scales, indicative of a constant dust-derived source of iron. Slightly enhanced and more variable iron/dust ratios can be observed during the most recent Holocene samples, which have been attributed to the deglacial activation of dust deflation zones local to TD.. In the last glacial period, evaluated here between 14 and 55 kyr BP, aerosol dust loading increased with particle size distributions shifting toward finer fractions 0.7–5 µm . During the LGM 14–32 kyr BP , the coarse particle percentage was usually less than 20% of the total dust mass, with the increased fluxes of fine aerosols attributed to long-range transport from deflation sources in Patagonia. The greater concentrations of glacial dust up to 640 ng g −1 during the LGM increased the fluxes of many elements to the Antarctic region, including Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ . Fe 2+ concentrations increased by seven-fold during the LGM, from interglacial values of 0.21 to 1.57 ng g −1 . We also observed an increase in Fe 3+ concentration, with LGM values 1.23 ng g −1 approximately double those of the interglacial 0.59 ng g −1 . The earlier glacial period of marine isotope stage MIS 3, evaluated between 32 and 55 kyr BP, was characterized by lower fine particle concentrations 76.5 ng g −1 , although still higher than interglacial values 19.2 ng g −1 , with greater inputs of CD particles. During MIS 3, Fe 2+ concentrations 0.63 ng g −1 were three times greater than interglacial values, while Fe 3+ concentrations were similar to interglacial values 0.79 ng g −1 Figure  1 .Fe 2+ black line and Fe 3+ dotted line concentrations ng g −1 in TD ice core samples. The light-shaded field represents FD 0.7–5 µm concentrations FP , while the dark-shaded field shows total 0.7–20 µm dust concentrations. The light and dark green lines respectively indicate raw and smoothed variations in δ 18 O, a paleotemperature proxy. Holocene LGM MIS 3 . The thin black line represents the ratio between dissolvable iron and FD 0.7–5 µm concentrations.. We propose that the changing glacial-interglacial Fe speciation in Antarctica results from the production of Fe 2+ by photoreduction of Fe 3+ during atmospheric transport of FD. proposed that iron solubility of mineral dust is primarily controlled by the surface area to volume ratio of the particles. Trapp et al . confirmed the proposal by demonstrating that iron solubility increases as its size fraction decreases from 10 to below 2.5 µm and attributed this to the enhancement of Fe II . This is consistent with our finding that Fe 2+ is associated with increased FD deposition in Antarctica. The 1–2 week transport time for glacial FD deposited in Antarctica allows time for the production of Fe 2+ by photoreduction during atmospheric transport and/or cloud processing, as proposed by Zhuang et al .. The greater increase of Fe 2+ compared to Fe 3+ during the glacial suggests that iron is present in a more soluble form Figures  3 a and 3b .Correlation of Fe species with FD 0.7–5 µm concentrations FP . Scatterplots show correlations of log Fe 2+ versus log FP a and log Fe 3+ versus log FP b . The slope of the regression line for log Fe 2+ is steeper than that for log Fe 3+ , suggesting a stronger association of Fe 2+ with FD FP . demonstrated the possibility for photochemical production of Fe II by solar irradiation in simulated glacier ice loaded with iron oxide particles. One can assume that photochemical Fe 2+ production would be constant over glacial-interglacial climate cycles and can therefore consider that photochemically produced Fe 2+ would lead to an elevated background concentration of Fe 2+ in TD ice. As we observe that TD Fe 2+ concentrations are sometimes <0.1 ng g −1 , we consider photochemical production of Fe 2+ to be insignificant compared to the glacial-interglacial variability observed in the record. and organic complexation are important factors controlling Fe solubility in seawater, much lower concentrations of organic carbon and hence ligands are observed in Antarctic ice. We must also consider the possibility for Fe II to be reoxidized to Fe III after deposition in the ice matrix. Fe II stability is pH dependent, where low pH tends to stabilize the Fe II /Fe III system. Mineral dust salts buffer Greenland ice core pH to values of 5.3 to 5.5, although pH can decrease in the presence of volcanic acids. If Fe II is more stable at lower pH values, then our findings of enhanced Fe 2+ during the dustier and therefore of higher pH glacial are likely to be conservative estimates. The presence of Fe II in atmospheric dust particles further suggests that this species is stable following photoproduction. On the basis of these considerations, we suggest that photochemical production of Fe II in Antarctic ice is minimal with respect to dust Fe input, Fe II is stable in Antarctic ice on glacial-interglacial time scales, and the somewhat higher pH of Antarctic glacial ice, relative to Holocene ice, may lead to an underestimation of the glacial enhancement of Fe 2+ .. Multiple studies have indicated that dust plumes from volcanic eruptions contain Fe in a highly soluble and thus more bioavailable form but did not determine Fe species. Hence, we consider it likely that this sample contains Fe 2+ -enhanced dust of volcanic origin. The speciation of this sample may also be controlled by the ice pH, which was lowered due to the presence of sulfate and potentially other volcanic acids. The influence of pH on Fe species stability and preferential molecular formation in ocean waters and glacial ice suggests the likelihood that volcanic acids promote the formation and retention of Fe II in dust. The two other Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ peaks 4 and 51 kyr BP are not associated with high concentrations of sulfate or any other analytes and hence may simply result from natural variability in the Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ratios found in TD dust Figure  2 .. Our results support the hypothesis that during glacial periods the iron present in long-range transported dust is in a more soluble and bioavailable form than that present during interglacial periods, with the ability to influence primary productivity in the Southern Ocean."
70,dust aerosol clouds,"New evidence of cloud invigoration from TRMM measurements of rain center of gravity. Much of the recent focus regarding aerosol effects on convective clouds and rain patterns has been on the possible invigoration of convective clouds by aerosols. Here we approach the issue using new methods, as rain vertical profiles' center of gravity RCOG and spread RS from TRMM are combined with aerosol optical depth AOD measurements from MODIS to examine this effect in various marine regions worldwide. Careful attention is also given to the meteorological, spatial and temporal variance in each region, as we try to extract and isolate the regional aerosol effect out of the dominant dynamic forcing. We show that for the majority of cases, high AOD values are correlated with higher RCOG and larger RS, indicating significant invigoration of the rain vertical distribution by aerosols. Citation: Heiblum, R. H., I. Koren, and O. Altaratz 2012 , New evidence of cloud invigoration from TRMM measurements of rain center of gravity, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L08803, doi: 10.1029/2012GL051158. . The radiative path refers to aerosol interaction with radiation that can change the environmental temperature and humidity profiles and by that influence cloud processes. Absorbing aerosol warms the aerosol layer and cools the layers below. This can suppress shallow clouds inside or below the aerosol layer by stabilizing the atmospheric layer below the clouds and suppressing moisture and heat fluxes from the surface. In the base of the microphysical effect lies the fact that aerosols serve as Cloud Condensation Nuclei CCN and as Ice Nuclei IN . By changing the size distribution and number of clouds drops/ice particles the microphysical path the aerosols will affect condensation/evaporation rates, latent heat release, collision coalescence efficiency and related clouds properties, such as: cloud lifetime, cloud dimensions, cloud reflectivity, particles phase, precipitation patterns and more. The magnitude and sign of these effects depend on the cloud type and on the environmental conditions.. Consequently, more droplets are able to reach above the freezing level and release freezing latent heat, enhance cloud ‘effective’ buoyancy and as a result increase cloud top height and lifetime. Smaller droplets with smaller size variance collide less efficiently and therefore the conversion of cloud droplets into rain drops is delayed. An amplification of such feedbacks occurs above the freezing level as freezing processes are less efficient for smaller droplets. The addition of more IN to the cloud involves many other complicated processes that are not well known yet and cannot be evaluated properly. Several other physical mechanisms have been suggested as players in cloud invigoration as well.. For deep convective clouds we can expect also larger hail, more thunderstorms and lightning flashes, and widespread anvils. Moreover, it was recently suggested that the delay in warm rain and redistribution of water and ice in higher levels in invigorated convective clouds will eventually result in significantly stronger rain rates. Observational evidence for deep convective invigoration has been seen in many regions globally, such as the biomass burning areas in the Amazon, tropical Atlantic Ocean, the relatively aerosol free tropical Pacific Ocean, and the South East US. It is important to stress that these findings do not necessarily imply that more aerosols results in larger total amount of precipitation in a given region. Some studies actually report a negative correlation between aerosol loading and cumulative precipitation. Although evidence supporting the theory of invigoration has been piling up in the recent years, the conditions, magnitude, and impacts of invigoration remain open questions. The non-linearity of the aerosol-cloud interactions, uncertainties in remote sensing measurements, and difficulty to decouple the aerosol net affect from the general meteorological forcing makes the study of aerosol effects on convective clouds among the most challenging tasks in the field. In this work, with the use of two independent remote sensing instruments, we combine AOD Aerosol Optical Depth measurements with rain vertical profiles in order to examine the possible effects aerosols may have on the vertical structure of rain within and below the cloud.. TRMM covers 35°N to 35°S in a non-sun-synchronous orbit, providing spatial and temporal statistics for the tropics and sub-tropical regions. 2B31 product combines both Precipitation Radar PR and Thermal Microwave Imager TMI data to obtain the precipitation vertical profile estimation. The product output is adapted to the PR vertical profile with a ∼5km footprint. The total swath is 250km and the vertical profile ranges from the surface up to 20km above the earth's ellipsoid, with a resolution of 250m i.e., total of 80 vertical levels ., each rain vertical profile was translated into rain center of gravity RCOG height and rain spread RS values. Rain center of gravity equation 1 and rain spread equation 2 are defined as: Where i is a running index between all 80 vertical levels, R i is the measured rain-rate at that vertical level, and H i is the actual height of the vertical level above the earth's ellipsoid. The RCOG can be considered as the physical height above sea-level that represents the weighted rain rate distribution of the column and RS represents the variance of the rain rate column around that height. The main advantage of this tool is that we focus on the distribution within the vertical profile which is insensitive and cancels out consistent rain-rate biases throughout the vertical profile. This is opposed to absolute value parameters such as surface rain-rate or total column rain mass which are regionally dependent and may contain many biases such as Z-R relationship biases due to different drop size distributions . Level 3 AOD at 550 nm data was collected from MODIS MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Level 3 algorithms available at http://modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov/MOD04_L2/atbd.html . The data includes daily measurements of global AOD on a 1° grid from both Terra overpass at 10:30 LST and Aqua overpass at 13:30 LST satellites. We narrowed the analysis to oceanic regions due to the fact that RCOG is highly correlated with topographic height which would be difficult to later decouple , and both the TRMM TMI and the MODIS AOD algorithms are considered superior over the sea because of the dark homogeneous background. Both clean and polluted environments were analyzed. Moreover, the regions are no larger in length than the typical synoptic scale of around 1000 km. The Regions of Interest ROIs are shown in Figure 1a , all located in areas with sufficient rain events for large statistics. Most regions lay within the latitude belt of 25°–35° N and S because of the increased statistics TRMM has in those latitudes twice as many overpasses compared to the equator , the proximity to continental pollution sources and ambient convective conditions. a Study regions of interest ROIs: South East US SEUS , South Atlantic SA , North Atlantic NA , Central Africa CAF , Eastern Mediterranean EM and Eastern China ECH . Land pixels in the ROIs were discarded. b RCOG anomaly as a function of AOD for South East US, May until October. Data is restricted by the VVEL at 350 mb, and divided to three regimes: Updrafts red lines , Neutral green lines and Downdrafts blue lines . Solid lines respresent the data sorted by AOD into five bins of equal RCOG counts, and dashed lines represent the weighted by standard deviation magnitude linear least squares fit done for each five bin set. d Standard deviation magnitudes for the corresponding bins in Figure 1b. c and e Same as Figures 1b and 1d, but for the RS anomaly. Both RCOG and RS show positive slopes for all meteorological regimes. Meteorological regime boundary values, counts per bin CPB , and linear fit equations appear in the figure legends., we used NOAA-NCEP Global Data Assimilation System GDAS reanalysis data for details see Parrish and Derber were correlated with GDAS meteorological parameters at pressure levels from 1000 mb to 100 mb a total of 157 GDAS parameters . The 3B42 estimates were interpolated from a 0.25° grid to a 1° grid that fits the GDAS data. Two parameters most correlated to rainfall were chosen to represent each region's meteorological forcing. Analysis of all the ROIs reveals these parameters to be vertical velocity VVEL and relative humidity RH at different pressure levels according to the specific location and season , in agreement with other studies. A representative example of the performed analysis for ΔRCOG can be seen in Figure 1b . This example focuses on the South-East USA SEUS ROI during May-October, while using vertical velocity VVEL at 350 mb as the restricting meteorological parameter. Rain COG anomaly values were first divided into three meteorological regime sets: 1 Updrafts negative values: −80 mb/hr to −1 mb/hr. 2 Neutral values: −1 mb/hr to 1 mb/hr. 3 Downdrafts positive values: 1 mb/hr to 40 mb/hr. We tried to equalize the number of rain counts for each meteorological regime. The three sets were then sorted into five equal count bins as a function of the corresponding same day AOD values. The data points connected by solid lines in Figure 1b and lines in Figure 1d represent the mean value and standard deviation of each bin, respectively. Finally, a weighted linear least squares fit dashed lines was applied to the data points, where the inverse of the variance in each bin was taken as its weight. Fit details appear in the figure legend. We conclude the example by showing similar results for the RS anomalies and their corresponding standard deviation per bin as a function of AOD in Figures 1c and 1e . Larger ΔRS values correspond to higher AOD values. The standard deviation values of ΔRS are not dependent on AOD. Meaning that the variance of the spread of the precipitation vertical profile is consistent for the whole AOD range. The results suggest that the rain profiles are not only “concentrated” at higher levels, but also exhibit larger vertical spread around that height as the AOD increases. This can be translated to an increase in rain initiation height for polluted clouds and implies cloud invigoration. All the slopes except one CAF slope in Figure 2 lie in the 1st quadrant positive slopes for ΔRCOG and ΔRS derivatives , indicating invigoration effects in all but one ROI. A clear positive linear dependence between ΔRCOG and ΔRS derivatives as a function of AOD is seen. Every ROI except CAF shows significant invigoration for at least one meteorological regime during a rain season. The invigoration effect seems to be larger and more robust at times when the rain clouds are deeper see Table S2 in the auxiliary material , e.g., ECH during monsoon season, SEUS throughout the year. In those clouds the aerosol effect on the microphysical and dynamical processes can alter the cloud's vertical distribution of water and released energy substantially. Based on the regions selection, the cloud fraction <80% filter, and further analysis of rain profile characteristics, we can assume that the typical rain profile in all ROIs is most probably of convective nature and in the majority of meteorological regimes reaches well above the freezing level.. We can speculate that this can be due to the region's aerosol composition. The CAF region is known to be abundant with biomass burning throughout the year and Saharan mineral dust aerosols mainly during the boreal winter and spring. Both types of aerosols are highly absorbing and can have a large effect on the thermodynamic properties of the environment beside their effect on microphysical processes, resulting in cloud suppression and atmospheric profile stabilization as previously seen in the Amazon basin. Moreover, due to lack of clean pixels in this region, we allowed for higher AOD values AOD < 1 . This can further support the stabilization idea, as in this range absorption depends on the AOD almost linearly while microphysical effects are expected to saturate in much smaller AOD values. However, the division to different AOD classifications yields clear translations shifts of the baselines of the meteorological trends. For any given meteorological state any line parallel to the Y axis , high AOD points tend to be consistently higher than low AOD ones. Or in other words, for the majority of given meteorological settings, increased AOD results in an increase in ΔRCOG and invigoration. Similar results were obtained in other regions, with CAF being the sole exception. As seen in Figure 1d , standard deviation values per ΔRCOG bin generally increase with increasing AOD.[19]  In this work we examined the effects aerosols have on rain profiles for various oceanic regions. Using TRMM satellite, we analyzed rain center of gravity RCOG height and rain spread RS about that height. Results show that for many regions and meteorological conditions high aerosol loading tends to increase both the RCOG and RS of the rain columns independently of the local meteorological forcing. Although we see an indication of invigoration in all regions, the results are more prominent in cases favoring deeper convective clouds, such as the South East US SEUS and Eastern China ECH during summer months. An opposite trend is seen in the Central Africa CAF region, where aerosols seem to have a negative effect on the rain profile extent. This could be due to the unique aerosol composition or methodological limitations in that region.[20]  Future work which characterizes the environmental conditions in higher resolution, aerosols according to their size, composition, physical and chemical properties and clouds properties can help us gain more insight regarding the conditions most favorable for aerosol invigoration of convective clouds."
73,dust climate ocean,"Does a theoretical estimation of the dust size distribution at emission suggest more bioavailable iron deposition?. Global models have been used to deduce atmospheric iron supply to the ocean, but the uncertainty remains large. We used a global chemical transport model to investigate the effect of the estimated size distribution of dust on the bioavailable iron deposition. Simulations are performed with six different size distributions for dust aerosols at emission using similar aerosol optical depths AODs to constrain the total emission flux of dust. The global dust emission rate using a recent theoretical estimate for the dust size distribution at emission 2116 Tg yr -1 is about two times larger than the average of estimates using the other four empirical size distributions 1089 +/- 469 Tg yr -1 . In contrast to the large differences in total emissions, the emission of fine dust diameter < 2.5 mu m is relatively robust 176 +/- 34 Tg yr -1 , due to the strong constraint of AOD on fine dust emission. Our model results indicate that soluble iron SFe deposition is relatively invariant to the dust size distribution at emission in regions where most soluble iron is provided by acid mobilization of fine dust. In contrast, the use of the theoretical size distribution suggests a larger deposition of SFe by a factor of 1.2 to 5 in regions where the concentration of acidic gases is insufficient to promote iron dissolution in dust particles, such as the South Atlantic. These results could have important implications for the projection of marine ecosystem feedbacks to climate change and highlight the necessity to improve the dust size distribution. Citation: Ito, A., J. F. Kok, Y. Feng, and J. E. Penner 2012 , Does a theoretical estimation of the dust size distribution at emission suggest more bioavailable iron deposition?, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L05807, doi:10.1029/2011GL050455. . The global distribution of the supply of atmospheric iron to the ocean has been estimated from modeling calculations, which are consistent with available observations e.g., aerosol optical depth AOD , concentration, and deposition . Typically, the emission of dust aerosols in the clay fraction particle radius < 1. The mass fluxes of mineral dust aerosol particles at emission are interpolated to represent the 4 model size bins shown in Table 1 . We adjusted the global scaling constant for dust emissions the variable Figures S1 and S2 . In addition to the Exp1 base case simulation with the empirical size distribution of as well as with the theoretical expression of 450 Tg . We compare the dust deposition from the other five experiments with the reference experiment Exp5 . The spatial distribution and amount of dust deposition strongly depends on the dust size distribution at emission. The model results suggest that the deposition flux of dust from Exp5 is substantially larger than that from Exp1–4, especially close to source regions such as the northern tropical Atlantic and Southern Ocean by a factor of 1.2 to 5 . The original dust source function assumed a dependence of the emitted dust size distribution on the wind speed. The differences in dust deposition between Exp5 and Exp5′ due to this assumption are generally within 20%.Annually averaged dust deposition from Exp5 g m −2 yr −1 and its ratio with the other numerical experiments.. We compare the SFe deposition from the five different experiments with the reference experiment Exp5 . As discussed above, the dust emission in the fine mode is relatively robust 180 ± 30 Tg yr −1 , due to the strong constraint of AOD. The deposition of fine dust dominates the SFe supply to significant portions of the open ocean, because the dissolution of iron due to acidic gases during dust transport is especially effective for small dust aerosols, which are externally mixed with carbonates. As a result, SFe is relatively invariant to the size distribution at emission over significant portions of the open ocean under polluted atmospheric conditions. Remarkably, the ratios of SFe deposition in the subarctic North Pacific and the South Pacific between Exp5 and Exp2 0.9–1.1 are much smaller than those of dust deposition 2.0–5.0 . In contrast, the SFe deposition to regions where the concentration of acidic gases is not high enough to promote iron dissolution in smaller dust particles, such as the South Atlantic downwind of the Patagonian desert, is sensitive to the size distribution at emission. In other words, the amount of soluble iron deposition in this region is more sensitive to the burden of coarse dust rather than that of fine dust as a result of weak acid mobilization in smaller particles. In order to quantify these contrasting effects, we calculated total SFe deposition to the two HNLC regions: 1 the subarctic North Pacific 40°N–60°N; 150°E–130°W and 2 the South Atlantic 40°S–90°S; 70°W–20°E Table 2 . The relative standard deviation of the SFe deposition in the subarctic North Pacific 15% is substantially smaller than that in the South Atlantic 33% .Annually averaged soluble iron deposition from Exp5 ng m −2 s −1 and its ratio with the other numerical experiments.Subarctic North Pacific Ocean 40°N–60°N; 150°E–130°W .South Atlantic Ocean 40°S–90°S; 70°W–20°E . Since most aquatic organisms can take up iron only in the dissolved form, the amount of soluble iron is of great importance for the prediction of marine productivity and the associated feedback to climate change. The deposition of soluble iron SFe is almost invariant to the size distribution at emission in significant portions of the open ocean. Our total amount of SFe deposition to the oceans 0.29 SFe Tg is within the range often used in ocean biogeochemical models 0.16–0.32 SFe Tg . However, our model result with the theoretical expression reveals that the deposition flux of SFe to the South Atlantic under relatively clean atmospheric conditions is substantially larger than that with the other four empirical size distributions by a factor of 1.2 to 5 . These results can have important implications for future improvements in air quality, which would reduce acid mobilization of dust aerosols. The corresponding reduction in soluble iron deposition may decrease the uptake of carbon by ocean biota and thus produce a positive radiative forcing. Our results imply that the differences in the future projections of SFe deposition will increase due to different dust size distributions at emission, even though a similar SFe deposition is obtained on a global scale under current conditions. More work is required to improve parameterizations of the dust size distribution to reduce the underlying uncertainty in bioavailable iron deposition estimates."
75,impact,"A new sedimentary benchmark for the Deccan Traps volcanism?. The origin of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary KPB mass extinction is still the center of acrimonious debates by opposing partisans of the bolide impact theory to those who favored a terrestrial origin linked to the Deccan Traps volcanism. Here we apply an original and high-resolution environmental magnetic study of the reference Bidart section, France. Our results show that the KPB is identified by an abrupt positive shift of the magnetic susceptibility MS , also observed by others at the KPB elsewhere. In addition, an anomalous interval of very low MS, carried by an unknown Cl-bearing iron oxide similar to specular hematite, is depicted just below the KPB. Grain-size and morphology of the Cl-iron oxide are typically in the range of hematitic dust currently transported by winds from Sahara to Europe. This discovery is confirmed in the referenced Gubbio section Italy suggesting a global scale phenomenon. As a conjecture we suggest an origin by heterogeneous reaction between HCl-rich volcanic gas and liquid-solid aerosols within buoyant atmospheric plumes formed above the newly emitted Deccan flood basalts. Based on this hypothesis, our discovery provides a new benchmark for the Deccan volcanism and witnesses the nature and importance of the related atmospheric change. Citation: Font, E., A. Nedelec, B. B. Ellwood, J. Mirao, and P. F. Silva 2011 , A new sedimentary benchmark for the Deccan Traps volcanism?, Geophys. Res. Lett., 38, L24309, doi: 10.1029/2011GL049824. . However, its contribution as the unique trigger of the KPB mass extinction is questionable. Multiple impacts or Deccan Trap volcanism are proposed as potential alternatives. The multi-impact hypothesis is based on the presence of multiple impact ejecta layers in both Late Maastrichtian and Early Danian sediments in Mexico and Texas. However, it was proposed that these deposits are better explained by impact-related liquefaction and slumping, consistent with a single, very-high-energy Chicxulub impact. The Deccan Traps volcanism in India, for which huge volumes of tholeitic lavas were emplaced in less than one million years, have caused severe environmental effects. Recent 40 K- 40 Ar dating in the Mahabaleshwar Formation identified three volcanic pulses, a first minor one at ∼67–68 Ma, a second major pulse at ∼65 Ma and a last pulse occurring shortly after the KPB. Nevertheless, a relative chronology of the catastrophic events that occurred in less than one million years is hard to reach using this method that suffers large systematic errors linked to inter-laboratory calibration, imprecise K and Ar isotopic standard data and incertitude of decay constants. Besides, biostratigraphic data from the intertrappean sediments of the Rajahmundry quarries of the Krishna-Godavari Basin indicated that the most massive Deccan trap eruption occurred near the KP mass extinction. However, in order to study the environmental impact of the Deccan traps in distal sections, other indirect mineralogical markers should be looked for. and field photographs. Figure 1 . The entire sequence consists of hemipelagic to pelagic sediments deposited in a deep basin. The Maastrichtian is dominated by marls and calcareous marls while Danian sediments are composed by pink and white biogenic limestone beds. The KPB is easily identified by the typical iridium anomaly, well preserved in the section and located at the base of a thin dark clay layer containing the relics of the Chicxulub impact. The sedimentation rate for the Maastrichtian is 4.3 cm/kyr but is unknown for the Danian. By analogy with the section of El Kef, Tunisia, a sedimentation rate of 1.4 cm/yr is suggested. Continuous sampling involved collecting oriented hand blocks in the field and subsequently cutting them in the laboratory into faceplates 1 cm in thickness.. ARM was induced with an AF field of 100 mT, biased with a DC field of 0.05 mT, using a LDA-3A demagnetizer coupled with an AMU-1A anhysteretic magnetizer. χ ARM was then calculated dividing the values of the induced magnetization A/m by the DC field value. Thermomagnetic curves under low and high temperature were acquired using the MFK1 AGICO apparatus. For the characterization of the magnetic carriers, and particularly the newly discovered Cl-rich iron oxide, we observed small fresh rock fragments under Scanning Electron Microscope SEM; Hitachi S-3700N coupled to an Energy Dispersive Spectra EDS; Bruker XFlash® 5010 detector.. The high MS signal of the dark clay layer is thus an excellent proxy in accurately locating the position of the KPB in distal marine sections.High-resolution magnetic data from the Bidart section showing that detrital titanomagnetite is the principal magnetic carrier, while the “pre-KPB” interval is dominated by a higher coercive iron oxide hematite? .MS profiles of the Bidart this study and Gubbio sections and microscopic analyses SEM-EDS of the pre-KPB interval. The detrital component i.e., titanomagnetite contrasts with the newly discovered Cl-bearing iron oxide, which exhibits a well-preserved and plate-like shape with grain size in the range of 2–10 μ m. SEM mapping blue/green and red shows that chlorine is always associated with iron and not in the matrix. and in others KPB sections wide world. In Bidart, this transition is accompanied by a decrease in ferrimagnetic content IRM 1T , an increase respective grain-size Xarm/X , and dominance of the hard i.e., high coercivity over the soft i.e., magnetite mineral fraction IRM -0.3T /IRM 1T Figure 3 . High coercivity and Curie temperatures around 680°C indicate the presence of hematite at this level Figure 2 . From a sedimentological point of view, this transition is associated with a change in the color of the sediment in Bidart, passing from greyish to reddish marls, with an abrupt decrease in the Ca content. SEM observations provide evidence of many Cl-rich iron oxide occurrences of an unknown origin admixed to the detrital titanomagnetite phases Figure 3 . The crystals have a platy specular morphology and a typical size range from 2 to 10 μ m that fits with the mean modal and median sizes of the present-day traveled Saharan/Sahelian dust 5–30 μ m . It is also worth noting that this major global eolian dust source for the Quaternary ca 50% of the emissions , although dominated by clays, is always characterized by a hematite-goethite component. Changes in fluxes, particle sizes and mineral proportions of this persistent source can be related to wind and, more generally, climate conditions.. A low MS interval related to the same abrupt change in the magnetic mineralogy, also containing hematite, was observed in the uppermost Maastrichtian at Gubbio. These authors interpreted the occurrence of hematite at this level as a result of secondary post-depositional processes, such as the percolation of reducing fluids before the final consolidation of the sediment. However, the abrupt shift in magnetic properties at the pre-KPB event does not agree well with an overprint linked to downward fluid migrations. Moreover, the reducing character speculated for such fluids is in contradiction with the development of a Cl-bearing iron oxide. Therefore, we examined the samples corresponding to the interval of interest in Gubbio and found exactly the same mineral as in the Bidart section, i.e., specular, 2–10 μ m in size and Cl-associated Figure 3 . Due to the fact that Bidart and Gubbio were separated by more than 1500 km during the late-Cretaceous, and that one section comes from the Atlantic and the other from the western Tethyan realm, we believe that this magnetic perturbation and its unusual mineral carrier may have global significance.. This coincides with an increase of species richness and the so-called “end-Maastrichtian warming event” Figure 4 . Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes from paleosol carbonates in Texas indicate the occurrence of two greenhouse episodes with atmospheric CO 2 levels between 1000 and 1400 ppmV, at 70 to 69 Ma and 500 kyr prior to the KPB, respectively. These are named the Mid- and Late-Maastrichtian events, and may have been due to Deccan volcanism. A major drop in the marine 187 Os/ 188 Os record in chron 29r at different geographic locations suggests a correlation between the end-Maastrichtian warming event and the main Deccan Traps volcanism. Despite uncertainties in the stratigraphic position and duration of the main Deccan volcanic pulses, there is some consensus that the main phase and largest lava volume production occurred just before the KPB. It is likely that the various records of a sudden paleoenvironmental change in the Upper Maastrichtian are indirect witnesses of this catastrophic volcanism.Global-scale correlations of the Bidart and Gubbio sections with paleoenvironmental proxies for referenced KPB sections worldwide. Profiles are anchored on the stratigraphic position of the KPB and, when available, on the Chron 29R/29N boundary ages vary among authors . Relationships with volume of basalts from the Deccan Traps are still ambiguous due to the unknown location of the KPB.. Indeed, these huge basaltic emissions located in the southern tropical realm were likely responsible for penetrative atmospheric convection and rise of volcanic plumes into the stratosphere, with effects in both hemispheres, especially to the west due to prevailing trade winds. Among the volcanic gases emitted, SO 2 , followed by HCl and HF, are the most important in volume. HCl is highly soluble in aqueous environments and wet deposition is expected in this case. However, in arid environments, HCl can remain in the plume and transform to reactive species, e.g., ClO; OClO. Dusts typical of subtropical environments, including hematite crystals, rose in the volcanic plumes, at least periodically, and were easily transported upwards under these conditions. Due to the well-known affinity of chlorine and its reactive species for metals, heterogeneous reactions between volcanic gas and solid/aqueous aerosols are expected. We thus contend that the Cl-bearing iron oxides that characterize the pre-KPB event in Bidart and Gubbio result from the volcanic origin of this environmental perturbation. They constitute an unprecedented piece of evidence indicating the acidification of the atmosphere as a consequence of the Deccan Traps main eruptive phase."
76,dust aerosol,"Implications of extinction due to meteoritic smoke in the upper stratosphere. Recent optical observations of aerosols in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere show significant amounts of extinction at altitudes above about 40 km where the stratospheric sulfate aerosol layer ends. Recent modeling of this region reveals that meteoritic smoke settling from the mesosphere and its interaction with the upper part of the sulfate aerosol layer is the origin of the observed extinction. Extinction in this region has major implications for the interpretation and analysis of several kinds of aerosol data satellite and lidar . We compare observations from the SAGE II satellite and from NOAA's lidar located at Mauna Loa, Hawaii to extinction profiles derived from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model WACCM coupled with the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres CARMA . Our results show that a major source of extinction exists in the region above about 30 km that must be addressed by all remote sensing instruments that have traditionally used the stratosphere above about 30 km as an aerosol free region to estimate the molecular component of their total extinction. It is also shown that meteoritic smoke not only contributes to but also becomes the dominant source of aerosol extinction above 35 km and poleward of 30 degrees in latitude, as well as above 40 km in the tropics. After addressing the concerns described here, current and past observations of this region could be reanalyzed to further our understanding of meteoritic dust in the upper stratosphere. Citation: Neely, R. R., III, J. M. English, O. B. Toon, S. Solomon, M. Mills, and J. P. Thayer 2011 , Implications of extinction due to meteoritic smoke in the upper stratosphere, Geophys. Res. Lett., 38, L24808, doi: 10.1029/2011GL049865. , suggested that evaporation and recondensation of much of the approximately 40 tons of micrometeors ablating in the atmosphere each day would lead to nanometer-sized smoke particles near the mesopause. They suggested that these particles would slowly coagulate to larger sizes and drift downward, creating a relatively uniform smoke layer that extends into the lower stratosphere. While numerical models of the properties of the particles have been constructed, and numerous rocket soundings have probed them, it is only recently that optical observations of meteoritic smoke in the mesosphere and upper stratosphere 35 to 85 km have confirmed their existence. Here we show that these particles provide a major source of optical extinction in the upper stratosphere that remote sensing instruments currently ignore when attempting to separate the amount of extinction due aerosols from the molecular component of their total observed extinction. Omitting this component of the total extinction leads to biases in retrieved extinction profiles throughout the stratosphere because it leads to an over-estimate of the molecular extinction. Consequently, a recalibration is necessary for measurements that determine aerosol extinction based on fitting observations to density profiles at altitudes where the atmosphere is incorrectly assumed to be “clean” purely molecular .    Recent. This altitude trend is consistent with a meteoritic source. This has been confirmed by the recent work of . and by the NOAA Global Monitoring Division's lidar located in Mauna Loa, HI. These comparisons show that meteoritic smoke contributes a significant proportion to the observed aerosol extinction in the upper stratosphere. Descending through the atmosphere, extinction by smoke is initially dominated by absorption, but scattering by mixed smoke-sulfate aerosols becomes the dominant process below about 32 km. In this second case the smoke particles cause the sulfate layer to have a larger number of relatively smaller sulfate aerosol particles. This allows the particles to have longer residence times and increase the total abundance of aerosol at these altitudes. It is also noted that the entire SAGE II extinction record 1984-2005 displays noticeable extinction in the region above 30 km, though the cause of the extinction has not previously been recognized as meteoritic smoke particles. coupled with the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres CARMA . The application of the coupled WACCM/CARMA model to stratospheric aerosols is described by  The meteoritic smoke in this model is based on the work of . Based on . The index of refraction for the sulfate aerosols is better understood due to the less complex composition of the aerosol binary sulfuric acid and water . As suggested by suggest that the meteoritic component of stratospheric aerosol increases with height. The observations come from three aircraft measurement campaigns flown from Houston, TX, Key West, FL and San Jose, Costa Rica onboard the NASA WB-57F, which we averaged. Model output is averaged over a similar geographic region as the observations. Measurements represent the fraction of the total number of particles that have positive ions from both sulfate and meteoritic smoke as defined by  In Figure 2 , model calculations that include and exclude meteoritic smoke are compared to SAGE II aerosol extinction retrievals averaged from 2000 to 2005 in the tropics 20°S to 20°N and northern mid-latitudes 45°N to 70°N . Both sets of model output compare well to SAGE II observations between 20 and 30 km. This suggests that sulfates dominate aerosol extinction in this region. However, above 30–35 km the two models diverge beyond the standard deviation of the observations in the mid-latitudes. The model including the smoke source much more closely resembles the observations above 30–35 km. The model without smoke diverges from the SAGE II observations at a lower altitude in mid-latitudes than in the tropics. The southern hemisphere follows similar trends to the northern hemisphere, but is on average 15% lower in the amount of extinction caused by aerosol.Globally averaged model aerosol extinction profiles 525 nm are compared to aerosol extinction profiles total extinction profiles with Rayleigh scattering subtracted from Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment SAGE II satellite retrievals at a wavelength of 525 nm. The SAGE data are averaged from years 2000–2005. Simulations are 10-yr averages. WACCM data points have been converted from a vertical model pressure grid to geometric altitudes using model derived temperature profiles for the comparison. The Rayleigh scattering lines are shown as a comparison for the amount of scattering caused by the molecular atmosphere. In Figure 4 , modeled aerosol backscatter coefficients and derived lidar aerosol backscatter coefficients are compared to demonstrate how neglecting the impact of meteoritic smoke can lead to an underestimate of the scattering due to aerosols. The aerosol backscatter is determined by subtracting the Rayleigh backscatter from the total observed backscatter. We have included a model derived Rayleigh backscatter profile to demonstrate the total amount of backscatter expected in an aerosol-free atmosphere. The lidar profiles are mean profiles taken from data spanning from 2000 to 2010 with major volcanic influences filtered out. Modeled profiles come from an average of ten years of model simulation.Comparison of the NOAA Mauna Loa, HI lidar aerosol backscatter total backscatter minus Rayleigh backscatter averaged from 2000 to 2010 to mean aerosol backscatter profiles derived from 10 years of model simulations, with and without the meteoritic smoke source, taken from the model grid box closest to Mauna Loa. Error bars represent 1σ standard deviation. The arrow represents the altitude where an 8% adjustment to the calibration scattering ratio was made to the original lidar data to account for the presence of meteoritic smoke. and is in wide use within the lidar community. The method uses an altitude range near the top of the raw lidar backscatter profile determined by a trade off between signal strength and where aerosol impacts were thought to be negligible to provide a reference point for a molecular density profile derived from a model or other observations. The adjusted Rayleigh profile is then projected down through the lower altitudes of the backscatter profile and any deviations of the actual lidar profile from the calibrated Rayleigh profile may be attributed to aerosols. suggest an increase in aerosol to Rayleigh ratio in the tropical stratosphere that ranges from 2-12% with an average of 6%. Based on these observations and model results, we apply an 8% adjustment to the calibration region between 35 to 40 km. and  While we have concentrated in this paper on discussing the role of meteoritic smoke above 30 km on lidar observations, suggest that differences between models and observations from SAGE II and lidar in the section of the profile from the tropopause to 20km could be due to the exclusion of carbonaceous aerosols in model. Carbonaceous aerosols have tropospheric sources and may account for a significant fraction of the total aerosol in this region., we assume the error in backscatter from improperly calibrating lidar data is on the order of 8-12%. This value also corresponds to the amount of adjustment in the recalibration of the lidar profile in Figure 4 needed to match the modeled aerosol. This change in scattering suggests that if the results of [2011] had used the unadjusted CALIPSO data the amount of cooling attributed to extinction from the stratosphere since 2000 would have been reduced by ∼5% ∼0.01W/m 2 . Possible solutions to achieve more accurate calibration include calibrating instruments within regions of the atmosphere in which information about the extinction of meteoritic aerosol is known and may be included within retrievals. SAGE and other similar observations including lidar observations after addressing the concerns described in this work above about 30 km altitude reflect the behavior of meteoritic smoke, and could be mined to learn more about temporal trends and latitudinal behavior of meteoritic smoke as well as its impact upon the sulfate aerosol layer."
77,climate atmosphere,"Shortwave radiative closure experiment and direct forcing of dust aerosol over northwestern China. Modeled and observed solar diffuse fluxes at the surface usually have unacceptably large discrepancies. It is necessary to address and resolve these discrepancies in order to accurately calculate a reliable aerosol direct radiative forcing DRF . We present and compare two methods of deriving dust aerosol optical properties from the MFRSR Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer observations and the AERONET products. The single-scattering albedo SSA values from MFRSR are found to be 10% less than those from the AERONET. This difference is mainly due to the different imaginary part of refractive index retrieved by the MFRSR compared to AERONET. These two sets of dust aerosol optical properties are used in the SBDART model to simulate the shortwave fluxes that are compared with the surface observations to perform the radiative closure experiment. The diffuse simulations using the AERONET-derived aerosol SSA may have significant discrepancies compared with the observed diffuse irradiances. The DRFs at the top of atmosphere TOA simulated with the MFRSR-derived aerosol optical properties are positive while the DRFs with the AERONET are negative. The sign of the DRFs at the surface and in the atmosphere using the MFRSR is the same as those using the AERONET while the magnitudes from the MFRSR are much larger. It indicates that dust aerosols with higher absorption as derived from the MFRSR heat the aerosol layer but cool the surface much more than those based on the AERONET, which may have an important impact on the boundary layer processes.

Lett., 38, L24803, doi:10.1029/2011GL049571. . The aerosol DRFs have been derived based on direct observations, remote sensing retrievals and radiative transfer model simulations, which are further used to assess the potential influence of aerosol on climate. The key parameters for determining aerosol DRF are the wavelength-dependent aerosol optical properties including aerosol optical depth reported that the closure experiments for both direct normal and diffuse broadband shortwave fluxes can be improved by better quantification of the input parameters and by better measurements of the solar irradiances.. Would one observe the similar discrepancy or not in the region of Northwest China? How different are the aerosol optical properties retrieved from different methods and how do these differences affect the closer experiment? What is the difference of aerosol DRF if the closure experiments can or cannot be achieved? These questions motivated the efforts presented in this study. The measurements which we use in this paper are from two intensive field campaigns at sites located in Northwest China Zhangye and Minqin, see the map in Figure 1 . In 2008, the ARM Ancillary Facility AAF was established at Zhangye 39.082° N, 100.276° E, 1461m elevation , which is at the southern edge of the Gobi desert and in the semi-arid area of Northwest China, during the period of late April to mid June. The broadband total irradiance was measured with a Black and White Pyranometer B&W, Eppley Laboratory, Newport, Rhode Island, USA and the diffuse flux was obtained by a CM21 Pyranometer Kipp & Zonen Inc., Delft, Netherlands . The direct normal irradiance was measured with two independent instruments which are a Normal Incidence Pyrheliometer NIP, Eppley Laboratory and CH1 Kipp & Zonen Inc. , respectively. Column aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo and asymmetry factor were derived from a CIMEL sun photometer and MFRSR. The case of April 24 case1 was identified as a totally cloud-free day.Geographic location of the two field experiment sites and HYSPLIT back trajectories analysis dashed lines at 3 km for the two cases. The Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer SBDART, version 2.4 model with a 4-stream method is used for calculations of plane-parallel radiative transfer in our study. The SBDART considers scattering and absorption processes that affect ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiation fields, which is flexible and could be readily adapted to our needs.. We used the MFRSR measurements to retrieve aerosol optical properties. The detailed retrieval method is presented by , we compare the volume-size distributions derived from the CIMEL and MFRSR in Figure 2 and the i k in Table 1 . The dominance of the large particle mode 0.4 to 15 μ m is a common feature Figure 2 from the two retrievals in both cases. The MFRSR-derived particle volume concentrations and median radii of both the fine and coarse modes are only slightly different from those retrieved by AERONET. To examine whether the different size distributions or the different refractive indices contribute to the differences in ω , we recalculated the Mie integrals using the MFRSR aerosol physical and optical properties but substituted the CIMEL-derived i k values. The bulk single-scattering albedos are 0.93 and 0.94 which are exactly the same as the CIMEL results for case 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, we can conclude that the difference in ω between our MFRSR retrievals and AERONET results are due to the different i k derived in the retrievals. The i k from the AERONET are 0.0035-0.0036 at 0.67 μ m, which are much smaller than 0.010 from our retrievals based on the MFRSR observations. Note that the i k value of dust aerosol given in the HITRAN database is 0.08, which is also more than twice as large as i k from AERONET. Larger i k values from MFRSR lead to smaller SSAs, indicating that dust aerosol can absorb more solar energy than those estimated by the AERONET.Volume-size distributions derived from MFRSR and CIMEL via inversion algorithms. For case 1, the simulated direct normal irradiances obtained by using the aerosol optical properties from both the CIMEL and MFRSR agree well with the observations from sunrise to sunset. The daylight-averaged value of observed direct normal irradiance is 691.0 W/m 2 . The fractional differences between simulations and observations are −0.4% and 0.6% for the CIMEL and MFRSR, respectively. For case 2, the simulated direct normal irradiances also agree well with observations. The fractional differences are within ±1% for both the CIMEL and MFRSR. These agreements between simulated and observed direct normal irradiances validate the dust aerosol optical depth retrievals from both CIMEL and MFRSR. For the total irradiances, the daylight-averaged value is 607.0W/m 2 for the case 1. The simulations from MFRSR are slightly smaller than the observations while the modeling results from CIMEL are larger than the observations at noon. For the case 2, the daytime-averaged total irradiance is 645.6 W/m 2 . The modeling results from MFRSR are close to the observations throughout the day while the simulations from CIMEL are larger during the afternoon.. Figure 4 shows the dust aerosol DRF at the TOA, surface and in the atmosphere by considering different aerosol optical properties from the MFRSR and AERONET for both cases. For case 1, dust aerosol DRF at the TOA is 2.1 W/m 2 using the aerosol optical properties derived from the MFRSR. However, the DRF at the TOA using the AERONET derived aerosol optical properties has a negative value of −3.5 W/m 2 . This is not surprising, because the aerosol can have a positive DRF at the TOA when the SSA is small, and a negative TOA DRF when the SSA is large for given surface albedo. The surface DRFs derived by the MFRSR and AERONET are both negative, which are −20.2 and −13.1 W/m 2 , respectively. The surface DRFs are much larger than the TOA DRFs, and thus large positive DRFs within the atmosphere occur as a consequence for both using the MFRSR and AERONET derived aerosol optical properties. The DRF results of case 2 are consistent with those of case 1. In case 2, The TOA DRF is +3.3 W/m 2 for the MFRSR and −1.8 W/m 2 for the AERONET. Dust aerosols reduce the solar fluxes reached at the surface and induce negative surface forcings of −17.7 and −9.1 W/m 2 for the MFRSR and AERONET, respectively. The MFRSR derived atmosphere DRF is 21 W/m 2 which is more than twice of that estimated by the AERONET.Summary of direct aerosol radiative forcing modeling results for both field study cases and measurements methods.[16]  From the two cases, we can see that the sign of the TOA DRFs derived by the MFRSR and AERONET is opposite due to the different imaginary refractive indices and SSAs of the derived aerosol optical properties. The sign of the DRFs at the surface and in the atmosphere derived by the MFRSR is the same as those derived by the AERONET; however the magnitude of the surface and atmosphere DRFs from the MFRSR is much larger than that of the AERONET. It indicates that the main effect of dust aerosol is to heat the aerosol laden layer in the atmosphere but cool the surface, which may have impact on the boundary layer vertical mixing. Micro-pulse lidar measurements at the Zhangye and Minqin sites shown that the dust layer was largely confined between the surface and 4km; thus the majority of the atmospheric heating was in that layer.[17]  The ARM ancillary Facility and SACOL Mobile Facility were deployed to Zhangye and Minqin in Northwestern China in 2008 and 2010, respectively. In this paper, we present and compare two methods of observing and deriving aerosol optical properties of dust by remote sensing for two cases. One is retrieved from MFRSR observations while the other is from the AERONET products. Our MFRSR-retrieved τ and g at 0.67 μ m and the Ångström exponents are consistent with those from the AERONET products. Both the MRSR- and AERONET-derived bimodal aerosol size distributions are dominated by large particles that have similar particle volume concentrations and median radii. However the ω values from MFRSR are 10% less than those from the AERONET. This difference is mainly due to the different i k values retrieved by the MFRSR compared to AERONET. The i k of the AERONET are 0.0035–0.0036 at 0.67 μ m. Our retrieved i k values are 0.01 which is more than twice as large as i k from AERONET.[18]  We used these two sets of dust aerosol optical properties as input to the SBDART model to simulate the shortwave flux reaching the surface and compare the simulations with the direct surface observations to perform the radiative closure experiment. The simulated direct normal irradiances from both the CIMEL and MFRSR agree within ±1% overall with the observations for the two cases. However, the diffuse simulations using the AERONET derived aerosol ω have significant discrepancies compared with the observed diffuse irradiances.[19]  The differences of ω from the CIMEL and MFRSR can also cause quite different aerosol DRFs. The computation of the dust aerosol DRFs show that the TOA DRFs derived by the MFRSR are opposite in sign compared to the AERONET. However, the sign of the DRFs at the surface and in the atmosphere derived by the MFRSR is the same as that derived by the AERONET but the magnitude of the surface and atmosphere DRFs from the MFRSR are larger than that of AERONET values. It means that dust aerosol, in our MFRSR study, has higher absorption and stronger effects on heating the aerosol layer but cooling the surface than those estimated by the AERONET. The potential effects of dust aerosol on the thermodynamic structure and development of boundary layer are under investigation."
78,dust ocean,"Surface water dissolved aluminum and titanium: Tracers for specific time scales of dust deposition to the Atlantic?. Surface water distributions of dissolved Al dAl and dissolved Ti dTi were investigated along a meridional Atlantic transect and related to dust deposition estimates. In the zone of Saharan dust deposition, highest dAl concentrations occurred in the tropical salinity minimum and suggest increasing Al dissolution from Saharan aerosols with wet deposition. By contrast, the dTi distribution is not related to precipitation but agrees with the pattern of annual dust deposition. In the zone of Patagonian dust deposition, elevated dTi concentrations contrasted with decreased dAl concentrations, indicating excess dAl scavenging onto biogenic particles in surface waters. Estimated residence times range from months to years for dAl and are similar to 10 times higher for dTi. This suggests that dAl reflects seasonal changes in dust deposition, while dTi is related to longer temporal scales. However, spatial variations in input and removal processes complicate the quantification of dust deposition from surface water concentrations. Citation: Dammsh user, A., T. Wagener, and P. L. Croot 2011 , Surface water dissolved aluminum and titanium: Tracers for specific time scales of dust deposition to the Atlantic?, Geophys. Res. Lett., 38, L24601, doi: 10.1029/2011GL049847. , yielding a better understanding of dust dissolution processes and surface water residence times. However, dust deposition to the open ocean is still poorly constrained and restricted to few direct observations and estimates based on model outputs. Dissolved Al dAl concentrations have been introduced as tracer to assess the supply of dust particles to the surface ocean. By contrast, very little is known about the potential application of dissolved Ti dTi concentrations to trace dust input. The utilization of a certain element as a tracer for dust supply requires some estimations of its input, depending on the dust composition and solubility in surface seawater, and of its removal from the surface ocean. Surface water residence times constrain the time frame of dust deposition that can be inferred from the trace metal concentrations. Both Al and Ti are abundant, relatively invariant components of the earth's crust and are predominantly delivered to the open ocean by dust deposition. In seawater, dAl and dTi have scavenging type distributions and so far are not known to have essential biological functions. However, both elements also behave specifically in their dissolution from dust and have different residence times in the surface ocean. Therefore, Al and Ti may provide complementary approaches to assess the dust deposition to the surface ocean.. The detection limit was 9 pM and the blank value 24 ± 3 pM for dTi. Supporting oceanographic data were obtained from continuous thermosalinograph measurements and the CTD system and are available in the Pangaea data management system.. Dissolved Al concentrations gradually increased from 5 nM in the Malvinas Current MC and the Canary Current CC towards 30 nM in the tropical salinity minimum TSM , in agreement with previous observations. Dissolved Ti concentrations showed two maxima, with concentrations of up to 90 pM in the MC and 110 pM in the CC at 15°N. Lowest concentrations of dTi ∼30 pM occurred in the South Atlantic Gyre SAG . Few other studies report surface water concentrations of dTi in the Atlantic Ocean. Our results lay in the same range as earlier observations in the western North Atlantic.Surface seawater concentrations of dAl, dTi, salinity and temperature over the cruise transect. Dotted lines define the hydrographic regions encountered during the cruise MC: Malvinas Current, BMC: Brazil Malvinas Confluence, SAG: South Atlantic Gyre, SEC: South Equatorial Current, TSM: Tropical Salinity Minimum, CC: Canary Current . Exact values and station locations are given in Table S1 in the auxiliary material .. The additionally elevated concentrations of dAl at 33°N can be attributed to the propagation of Al-rich subtropical mode water from the western Atlantic basin. Maximum concentrations of dTi occurred north of the highest dAl concentrations and are more in line with the location of highest annual dust deposition. In the South Atlantic, elevated dTi concentrations indicate the input of dust from Patagonian sources. However, in this region dAl concentrations were decreased, with exception of elevated concentrations in the confluence of the Brazil and the Malvinas Currents BMC that can be attributed to the delivery of Al-rich equatorial waters with the Brazil Current BC . Overall, our data suggest that specific input and/or removal processes determine the distribution of dAl and dTi in the different regions., assuming that over the Atlantic transect this estimate adequately reflects the spatial and temporal variations in dust deposition. The soluble flux was calculated assuming dust fractions of 8.04% and 0.41% for Al and Ti and solubilities of 5% and 0.1% respectively. The elemental fractions in the dust are well established, however, the solubilities are key uncertainties in the residence time calculation. For Al, the solubility estimate is based on average values reported for the Atlantic. For Ti, an intermediate value was chosen based on results in seawater incubations with Saharan dust auxiliary material and aerosol filter leachings with deionized water. The observed variations in the Ti solubilities may reflect higher Ti solubility in deionized water, specific properties of aerosol and dust samples, or the experimental setup., the North Pacific and from modeling approaches. For dTi, to our knowledge these are the first residence time estimates in Atlantic surface waters. The residence times of dTi clearly exceed those of dAl, on average by a factor of around 10. This generally indicates higher reactivity of dAl in the surface ocean. Specific differences occurred in the MC and the TSM, and could be related to spatial variations in both inventories and/or atmospheric fluxes of dAl and dTi in these regions. and solubility experiments by . Suspended material may be transported offshore with surface currents, however, previous studies showed only small release of dTi through sediment resuspension compared to considerable release of dAl. Similarly, pore water profiles indicate the benthic supply of both metals to bottom waters. The supply of excess dTi over dAl in the MC is thus unlikely, suggesting that the deviating distributions and residence times of dAl and dTi rather result from the preferential removal of dAl over dTi. The removal of dAl is strongly influenced by surface adsorption on biogenic particles and/or biological uptake, and is thus coupled to biological productivity. Observations in sediment cores indicate that dTi is less susceptible to such removal than dAl. SeaWiFS images show high chlorophyll a concentrations in the MC in the two months preceding the sampling auxiliary material . This suggests that the removal with biogenic particles may indeed have resulted in excess removal of dAl over dTi. The high reactivity of dAl would also explain why dAl concentrations in April do not reflect the Patagonian dust deposition that occurs predominantly in austral summer. for both the annual and the sampling period April-May average. For dAl the correlation improves if the seasonal dust deposition is considered Figures 2a and 2b , suggesting that dAl concentrations are stronger related to integrations of the dust deposition over shorter time scales. By contrast, dTi concentrations are reasonably correlated with both the annual and the seasonal dust deposition estimate Figures 2c and 2d . These observations support the idea that dAl concentrations reflect seasonal variations in the dust deposition, whereas dTi concentrations rather reflect interannual variations in the dust deposition. This suggests that dAl and dTi concentrations may serve as tracers for dust deposition variations over different time scales. However, in addition to the general relationship, dAl and dTi distributions show specific spatial variations over the Atlantic transect see data points from MC in Figure 2 . As discussed above, additional differences between both metals can be attributed to the excess removal of dAl in the MC and to the elevated supply of only dAl with wet deposition in the TSM. Previous studies suggested the simple estimation of dust inputs from dAl concentrations with the assumption of invariant values for both residence times 5 years and soluble dust fractions of Al 1.5–5% . However, our data indicate variations in both factors in different regions of the Atlantic Ocean. Considering the observed residence times Table 1 , such calculation would likely overestimate dust inputs in the SAG dAl residence times >5 years and underestimate inputs in the MC, TSM and CC dAl residence times <5 years . Similarly, underestimated solubilities of dust Al in regions with strong influence of wet deposition would result in overestimated dust inputs.Dissolved Al and dTi concentrations versus average dust deposition estimates from the model composite by  Despite the common source of dAl and dTi we observed distinct differences in the distributions of both metals in Atlantic surface waters. Patagonian dust input was only reflected in dTi concentrations, most likely due to fast removal of dAl onto biogenic particles. In the North Atlantic, highest dAl concentrations indicate the increased dissolution and supply of dust derived Al with wet deposition. By contrast, the distribution of dTi was not related to wet deposition but reflected the pattern of the average annual dust deposition. Residence time estimates and the relation between surface water concentrations and dust deposition suggest that dAl concentrations may serve to trace seasonal variations in the dust deposition, whereas dTi concentrations may serve to trace variations in the dust deposition over longer time scales. However, our data also indicate spatial differences in supply and removal processes of dAl and dTi in the surface ocean. Variations in solubilities and residence times have to be considered if the dust deposition is assessed from surface water concentrations of dAl and dTi."
79,particles atmosphere aerosol,"Glaciation temperatures of convective clouds ingesting desert dust, air pollution and smoke from forest fires. Heavy aerosol loads have been observed to suppress warm rain by reducing cloud drop size and slowing drop coalescence. The ice forming nuclei IFN activity of the same aerosols glaciate the clouds and create ice precipitation instead of the suppressed warm rain. Satellite observations show that desert dust and heavy air pollution over East Asia have similar ability to glaciate the tops of growing convective clouds at glaciation temperature of Tg < similar to -20 degrees C, whereas similarly heavy smoke from forest fires in Siberia without dust or industrial pollution glaciated clouds at Tg <= -33 degrees C. The observation that both smoke and air pollution have same effect on reducing cloud drop size implies that the difference in Tg is due to the IFN activity. This dependence of Tg on aerosol types appears only for clouds with r e-5 < 12 mu m r e-5 is the cloud drop effective radius at the -5 degrees C isotherm, above which ice rarely forms in cloud tops . For the rest of the clouds the glaciation temperature increases strongly with r e-5 with little relation to the aerosol types, reaching Tg> similar to -15 degrees C for the largest r e-5 , which are typical to marine clouds in pristine atmosphere. . Precipitation in convective clouds with aerosol-induced suppressed coalescence is initiated by nucleation of ice crystals that form ice hydrometeors that collect the supercooled cloud water. These ice particles are nucleated by ice forming nuclei IFN aerosols, which can also serve as CCN that nucleate cloud drops before freezing them. Greater IFN activity of the ABC aerosols means formation of more ice hydrometeors at higher temperatures lower in the clouds, potentially compensating to some extent for the suppression of precipitation by the CCN activity of the ABC. stated that “certainly, natural mineral particles dominate the atmospheric nucleation of ice in the conditions of low temperatures of −12° to −15°C or less.”. The observations in Beijing showed that average IFN concentrations in pollution haze exceed by up to a factor of two the average IFN in dust, especially at the higher temperatures Figure 1 . The same observational procedure and method were used in the same season and location in 1995. The IFN for heaviest dust and air pollution with visibilities ∼1km in 1995 showed much greater overall concentrations, but air pollution and heavy desert dust had still comparable IFN activity, with desert dust exceeding the pollution activity by a factor of 2 at −15°C. The reported concentrations of IFN in China increased by a factor of 5 to 10 between 1980 and 2000. This cannot be explained by natural causes, leaving the increasing levels of air pollution as the main suspected cause.IFN concentrations in pollution haze and dust in Beijing. The data of 1 and 2 in the legend are the average IFN concentrations from 4 blowing dusts and 6 pollutions in 1963 and the IFN from heaviest dust storm and air pollution with visibilities of ∼1 km during 1995 observation period, respectively. The broken black line shows the average IFN concentration for the whole observational period in 1995. Both measurement sets show the same dependency of IFN on T, but with higher concentrations at the latter set.. This method examines the statistical relation between the satellite-retrieved pixel values of T and r e at the tops of a cloud ensemble in an area that contains the growing clouds of a convective cluster. The 30 th percentile of r e is taken for all the 1-km pixels having T of 1°C interval. The ensemble approach is equivalent to tracking the evolution of cloud top microstructure as it grows to lower T. The r e increases with height i.e., with decreasing T , until full glaciation is reached. At greater heights and lower T r e remains constant or decreases., and for which MODIS measurements of aerosol optical thickness AOT were available. Seven cases with visibly obvious heavy dust storms that did not coincide with the CALIOP were added, for better representation of such situation., and consisted of Pristine maritime, Desert dust, Polluted dust and Pollution. The latter contains the CALIOP classifications of Polluted continental, clean continental and Smoke. The CALIOP distinction between Desert dust, Polluted dust and Polluted continental is based mainly on the lidar depolarization ratio. Polluted dust can be misclassified as Polluted continental if heavily coated with pollution. Another type of pollution-free smoke from forest fires in remote areas of Siberia was added, defined as visibly thick smoke emanating from fires seen as “hot spots” in the satellite imagery. The MODIS “Deep Blue” AOT was used for the dust and polluted-dust aerosol types, and the 550 nm AOT was used for the other aerosol types. Back trajectory analysis of the air masses between 0 and 1000 m above ground was done using HYSPLIT for identifying cases that have air mass in source regions of desert dust during the past 96 hours. This was used for identifying the Polluted continental cases that might contain some desert dust. A similar analysis was done for identifying marine cases that might contain some aerosols emitted form land or island areas. The back trajectory analysis did not show any apparent difference between the cases that had suspected other sources and the pure cases see Figures 4b and 5 , giving more credibility for the CALIOP aerosol classification.. This was ascribed mostly to the ice multiplication mechanism shown operative in the laboratory in clouds containing drops >12 μ m in radius and at temperatures between −3 and −8°C. Another mechanism for enhancing glaciation of large cloud drops is their larger chance to contain or contact IFN. These mechanisms do not explain fully the observed fast glaciation in deep convective clouds with large drops, which is typical for tropical maritime conditions. There are still wide gaps in our understanding of the processes that glaciate clouds. According to our present knowledge, cloud drop size appears to dominate Tg at r e-5 > 12 μ m, where r e-5 is the cloud drop effective radius at the −5°C isotherm.. Thirty eight cases had r e-5 ≥ 12 μ m. The remaining 109 cases were defined as r e-5 < 12 μ m. They include 15 cases with highest observed cloud base temperature <−5°C. The geographic distribution and the types of cases are given in Figure 2 .The geographical locations of the cases analyzed in this study. The color marks the aerosol type according to CALIOP, as shown in the legend. The Siberia Smoke was determined independently of CALIOP. Triangles mark cases where r e > 12 μ m at the −5°C isotherm, indicating favorable conditions for secondary ice nucleation. Circles mark the rest of the cases, where glaciation due to the primary ice nucleation activity of the IFN is more likely. Hollow symbols have possible contributions from other sources O.S. . Hollow red circles mark cases of polluted aerosols that a 4 days back trajectory comes from the dust source regions, which are delimited by the black line. The hollow triangles mark maritime cases with back trajectories originating over land or islands. The large difference in Tg between the maritime and continental aerosols highlights the importance of cloud drop size and its relevance to the determination of Tg. This was looked into by relating Tg to r e-5 , which captures the cloud drop size just below the isotherm where cloud drops can start glaciating. Indeed Tg is correlated positively with r e-5 . Furthermore, the range of Tg narrows for larger r e-5 Figure 4a . The clouds with the largest drops always glaciate at Tg > −20°C, whereas clouds with the smallest drops can glaciate at any temperature between −10° and −38°C. This means that there is much more room for IFN to determine Tg in clouds with smaller drops, whereas the IFN activity in clouds with large drops is amplified greatly by secondary ice forming processes, causing Tg to increase with r e . Observations of clouds with extremely low Tg = −37.5°C and the simulation of the sensitivity of their Tg to CCN concentrations show that high CCN concentrations are necessary for allowing the very low Tg. The CCN nucleate larger concentrations of smaller drops that have reduced probability of freezing because they have less chance to contain or contact IFN and do not support secondary ice forming processes. Therefore, occurrence of high Tg in clouds with small drops can be explained by large concentrations of IFN that overcome the tendency of these small drops to freeze at low temperatures.The dependence of the glaciation temperature of the cloud drop effective radius at the −5°C isotherm, plotted for a all aerosol types, and b by aerosol type, as shown in the legend. The legend of Figure 4b denotes by one asterisk slopes with statistical significance of P < 0.05, and two asterisks for P < 0.01.. Ash from pyro-Cb was observed to produce ice at −15°C, but it was in layered flying ash that stayed for long time at the −15°C isotherm. This underlines the fact that the calculated Tg in this study pertains to the tops of growing convective clouds.The dependence of the glaciation temperature of the various aerosol types on the aerosol optical thickness, for a cloud with small drops, in which mostly primary ice nucleation on IFN is expected to form, and b for clouds with drops r e < 12 μ m at −5°C, where most ice is expected to form by secondary ice nucleation processes. Best fit lines of Tg with the logarithm of AOT are plotted only for classes with at least 4 cases. The legend denotes by an asterisk slopes with statistical significance of P < 0.05. that reduce cloud drop size and hence lower Tg. In attempt to disentangle these opposite effects, the dependence of Tg on AOT is shown in Figure 5 separately for smaller and larger drops with respect to r e-5 = 12 μ m. In agreement with these considerations, Tg is observed to increase with AOT for clouds with small drops Figure 5a and decreases with AOT for the clouds with large drops Figure 5b . The significance level of the slope for all the points combined in Figure 5b is P = 0.07.. According to Figure 5a the pure dust has narrower range of Tg values compared with pollution or polluted dust, probably because their composition is more variable than the composition of the pure dust. Until now, the smoke and pollution aerosol effects on precipitation have been recognized mainly through their impact on cloud drop size and suppression of drop coalescence. Here we show that, in heavy aerosol loads, the suppression of warm rain processes allows the IFN activity to become dominant in the precipitation forming processes. Furthermore, we show that the industrial air pollution over East Asia has comparable IFN activity to that of desert dust there, in agreement with previous IFN measurements in China. This means that the IFN activity of air pollution might restore at least some of the precipitation that is suppressed by the CCN activity of the same aerosols in deep convective clouds. Adding IFN for restoring suppressed precipitation is in fact the objective of glaciogenic cloud seeding for rain enhancement. This means that glaciogenic seeding is superfluous in an atmosphere that contains large amounts of industrial pollution and/or desert dust aerosols, as was already previously suspected. On the other hand, clouds ingesting pristine air with relatively small aerosol concentrations develop large drops that allow efficient warm rain processes and high Tg even without large IFN concentrations. This leaves only lightly polluted clouds as having the potential for very low Tg, where glaciogenic seeding has the potential to increase Tg and possibly enhance precipitation or suppress hail.[18]  More generally, the results show that IFN have a major role in potential buffering of the rain suppression effects of aerosols. This study provides unique measurements that are necessary for quantifying the IFN effects of various aerosol types in glaciating convective clouds at different cloud drop sizes. This kind of quantification can be used in parameterizing these aerosol effects in cloud and climate models."
80,dust aerosol ocean,"Further evidence for significant smoke transport from Africa to Amazonia. Polarization-Raman-lidar observations of vertical aerosol profiles were performed 60 km north of Manaus, Brazil, in the Amazon rain forest during Amazonia's wet season from January to May 2008. Very clean background conditions with a mean AOD 532 nm of 0.03 +/- 0.02 were frequently found. However, in about one third of all lidar measurements advection of smoke and dust aerosol from Africa were observed. The contribution of African smoke and Saharan dust particles to the total backscatter and extinction coefficient was determined by means of the measured particle depolarization ratio. A decreasing contribution of smoke particles to the total particle extinction coefficient from values around 60%-80% in January and February 2008, to values of 0%-50% in May 2008 was observed. Smoke-related extinction coefficients and optical depths up to 80 Mm -1 and 0.15 at 532 nm, respectively, were recorded. Citation: Baars, H., A. Ansmann, D. Althausen, R. Engelmann, P. Artaxo, T.

Recent studies suggest that even biomass burning aerosol BBA is advected from Africa toward the Amazon Basin during the wet season. These studies corroborate satellite observations presented by and AMAZE-08 Amazonian Aerosol Characterization Experiment 2008 . Vertical profiles of the particle backscatter coefficient at 355, 532, and 1064 nm, of the extinction coefficient at 355 and 532 nm, and of the depolarization ratio at 355 nm were measured with the automated, multiwavelength polarization-Raman lidar Polly . Thus, based on these observations, we use  Vertical aerosol profiles could be obtained for 53 lidar observations days during the wet season 2008. The aerosol optical depth AOD at 532 nm for these 53 observations is shown in Figure 2 . The AOD was obtained by integrating the vertical profile of the particle extinction coefficient. For the height range up to 750 m agl at which extinction coefficients were not available, a well-mixed atmosphere with a height-independent extinction coefficient equal to the extinction at the lowest reliable lidar profile height was assumed. This assumption leads to errors of 10–20% in the determination of the AOD as comparison with AERONET sun photometer measurements during the dry season showed.Temporal evolution of the AOD at 532 nm during the wet season 2008. Error bars indicate the uncertainty due to the applied lidar ratio. AOD values below the red line indicate background aerosol conditions. In the following, we assume that an AOD > 0.05 indicates long-range transport of particles. This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that situations with AOD > 0.05 typically lasted for several days and were usually characterized by an enhanced particle depolarization ratio, which is indicative for Saharan dust. An AOD > 0.05 together with an enhanced particle depolarization ratio were observed for 17 lidar measurements in the wet season 2008 32% of the 53 lidar sessions . , and the third one was recorded from 8–11 May 2008. Another period with strongly enhanced AOD occurred mid March. Rarely, advection of African aerosol for one day only was observed.Vertical profiles of the particle extinction coefficient at 532 nm and the corresponding dust fraction 355 nm for nine selected days. The legend indicates the date of the observation in 2008 and the measured AOD at 532 nm.. The opposite decreasing lidar ratio with increasing wavelength is observed for local smoke and urban haze.. The authors state that aerosol from outside the Amazon Basin occasionally influences the aerosol population. Marine aerosol and African smoke are suggested to be good candidates for that out-of-Basin aerosol. The advection of marine aerosol can not be ruled out. However, the analyzed optical properties do not indicate a significant influence of marine aerosol to the total optical properties. Particles of marine origin have lidar ratios well below 30 sr. Such low lidar ratios were never observed with the EUCAARI lidar in Amazonia in 2008. To quantify the contribution of dust and smoke particles to the aerosol conditions in Amazonia, the dust-related and smoke-related AOD was computed from the vertical profiles of the dust fraction and the particle extinction coefficient. Figure 4 shows the results for the 17 cases of long-range transport. We subtracted an AOD of 0.03 from the smoke-related AOD to account for the local, natural impact background AOD in Amazonia . From Figure 4 one can conclude that the 532 nm AOD was between 0.05 and 0.15 for African BBA particles during the 8–15-February-period. The BBA contribution to the AOD was up to 0.1 for the period end of February and between 0.06–0.09 for the mid of March period. A strong Saharan dust event was observed only on one day 8 May 2008 with a dust-related AOD value up to 0.18. The absolute smoke contribution to the AOD was highest in February 2008 with values up to 0.15.Smoke and dust AOD for the 17 observation cases in 2008 indicating the advection of African aerosol toward Amazonia. The measured total particle optical depth is obtained by adding 0.03 to the shown AOD full green-orange bar .[20]  Episodes of long-range transported African aerosol smoke and dust can significantly disturb the Amazonian aerosol background conditions, expressed by an AOD of 0.03 ± 0.02 at 532 nm. For the first time, a vertically resolved documentation of African smoke transport was performed based on long-term lidar observations in the Amazon Basin in 2008. Dust and smoke contributions to the measured optical properties were separated by means of the measured particle depolarization ratio. In about one third 32% of all lidar observations during Amazonia's wet season, African aerosol predominantly smoke and dust were detected. In about half of these cases, African smoke particles contributed to more than 50% to the total AOD. The smoke transport from Africa toward Amazonia occurs predominantly between January and April when the fire activity in Central Africa is highest. Saharan dust–laden air masses are enriched by the fire smoke particles when these air masses cross the fire areas in Africa from northeast to southwest."
81,ocean,"Luxury uptake of aerosol iron by Trichodesmium in the western tropical North Atlantic. Dust transported from North Africa carries micronutrient iron Fe to the western tropical North Atlantic WTNA which may significantly influence the metabolism of the N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria, Trichodesmium. For the first time, we conducted shipboard incubation experiments using freshly collected aerosol, seawater, and Trichodesmium colonies. Trichodesmium assimilated significant amount of aerosol Fe up to 14 times higher than the control. The uptake amount increased proportionally to the P: Fe ratio that Trichodesmium initially contained and to the aerosol Fe added and leached to the incubation solution. Trichodesmium assimilated more aerosol Fe than needed for its maximum growth 0.14 d -1 demonstrating a high capacity of luxury uptake of Fe from the dust. Citation: Chen, Y., A. Tovar-Sanchez, R. L.

Nonetheless, the results still clearly show the large capacity of luxury uptake of aerosol Fe by the Trichodesmium in the WTNA."
83,aerosol,"Atmospheric bioaerosols transported via dust storms in the western United States. Measurements are presented showing the presence of biological material within frequent dust storms in the western United States. Previous work has indicated that biological particles were enhancing the impact of dust storms on the formation of clouds. This paper presents multiple case studies, between April and May 2010, showing the presence of and quantifying the amount of biological material via an Ultraviolet Aerodynamic Particle Sizer during dust events. All dust storms originated in the Four Corners region in the western Untied States and were measured at Storm Peak Laboratory, a high elevation facility in northwestern Colorado. From an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, the mean dust particle size during these events was approximately 1 mu m, with number concentrations between 6 cm -3 and 12 cm -3 . Approximately 0.2% of these dust particles had fluorescence signatures, indicating the presence of biological material. Citation: Hallar, A. G., G. Chirokova, I. McCubbin, T. H. Painter, C. Wiedinmyer, and C. Dodson 2011 , Atmospheric bioaerosols transported via dust storms in the western United States, Geophys. Res. Lett., 38, L17801, doi: 10.1029/2011GL048166.  and albedo decreases; and indirectly through their role as either cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei. The role of aerosols on clouds represents the largest uncertainty in climate change models and predictions. Current estimates of the effect of aerosols on clouds −1.8 to −0.3 W m −2 remain uncertain because of our inability to accurately estimate the spatial and temporal distributions of aerosol concentrations, size, and composition, and effect on both water and ice clouds. Specifically, . One potential explanation for this discrepancy may be the role of bioaerosols as ice nuclei. Bioaerosols are defined as organic aerosols that are alive, carry living organisms, or are released from living organisms. Examples of bioaerosol include bacteria, fungi, viruses, pollen, cell debris, and bio-films, ranging in size between 10 nm and 100. These increasing dust storms have large implications for the regional snowpack in the Upper Colorado River Basin and its runoff by shortening seasonal snow coverage. This study provides a direct link between these regional dust storms and bioaerosols traveling with the dust.; an example of this instrumentation is the Ultraviolet Aerodynamic Particle Sizer UV-APS . To better constrain our understanding of the transport mechanisms of bioaerosols within dust storms in the western United States, a UV-APS was deployed at Storm Peak Laboratory from late winter through early summer of 2010. We describe these results below., and Huffman et al .. SPL is situated on a 70 km long north-south mountain barrier, oriented generally perpendicular to the prevailing westerly winds. The facility is located on a peak with limited upwind vegetation or topography to create local turbulence under normal airflow conditions. SPL experiences transport from distant continental sources including urban areas, power plants, and wildfires, along with intercontinental dust from Asia. As standard at mountain top locations, SPL experiences upslope winds typically mid-day and clean nighttime conditions. Particles at SPL are sampled from an insulated, 15-cm diameter manifold within approximately 1 m of its horizontal entry point through an outside wall. The 4 m high vertical section outside the building is capped with a heated inverted can. This aerosol manifold has approximately a flow of 500 L min −1 and a 50% cut-off at a particle size of 5 microns. Both the APS and UV-APS instruments were attached to the aerosol manifold using 0.75 in conductive tubing and had a 1 L min −1 sample flow rate. Both the APS and UV-APS were placed at the same point on the aerosol manifold and care was taken to avoid any horizontal tubing between the aerosol manifold and the instruments., number size distributions of fluorescent aerosol particles dN f/ dlogD were calculated for each size bin from the sum of the particle number concentrations in fluorescence channels 3-64. This methodology represents a lower limit for the actual abundance of primary biological aerosol particles. All analysis of the APS and UV-APS includes size bins 2-64; the first bin representing particles below 0.54 μ m was not included. Below, we present three case studies that occurred between April 12 and May 24, 2010. These illustrate that dust storms originating in the Four Corners region in the western United States intersection of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona contain bioaerosols. All dust cases occurred during the nighttime hours, when it is expected that the air masses at the SPL are more regional, and thus less impacted by the local boundary layer. These events at SPL are consistent with dust events D5 April 12–13 , D7 May 9 , and D9 May 22 that were documented at Senator Beck Basin Study Area in the San Juan Mountains, Colorado by the Center for Snow and Avalanche Studies www.snowstudies.org as part of the Colorado Dust on Snow monitoring program. It should be noted that there is a potential fluorescence signatures from Kaolin, yet as shown by aeolian dust from the Four Corners region has only traces of Kaolin 1.7 ± 0.9 percent by weight . and Cahill and Wakabayashi , although the total particle concentration reported here is much higher. The Huffman et al .  Aerosols larger than 6 μ m were observed on May 10 with an event centering on 02:00 MST. As shown in Figure 2a , dust was observed at SPL between 19:00 MST on May 9 and 08:00 MST on May 10. The mean number concentration for the APS was 6.3 ± 5.2 cm −3 during this period. The mean diameter of these aerosols, during this period was 1.06 ± 0.09 μ m. Simultaneously, the UV-APS also observed a florescence signal indicating the presence of biological material, as shown in Figure 2b . The UV-APS mean number concentration was 0.01 ± 0.01 cm −3 , representing approximately 0.2% of the total aerosol concentration. Similar to case 1, the wind direction was steadily shifting in direction from the south to the west Figure 2c . A 48-hour back trajectory for this case Figure 2d was created using HYSPLIT. Air from the southwest consistently, as shown by the convergence of the ensemble, reaches SPL at 24:00 MST on May 9 07:00 UTC on May 10 . The back trajectory shown in Figure 2d indicates that the air is in contact with the ground surface in the vicinity of northern Arizona approximately 23 hours before reaching SPL.Figures 2a–2c represent a times series of data covering case study 2. a The APS particle size distributions as a concentration matrix, with the x-axis representing the particle size and the colors represent the normalized concentration dw/dlogDp . b Fluorescence biological particle size distribution from the UV-APS, also as a concentration matrix. c The meteorological conditions pressure and wind direction during the case study. d An ensemble HYSPLIT backtrajectory from SPL for the center 00:00 MST of this event. The time averaged size distributions were similar for cases 1, 2, 3, as illustrated in Figure 4 . Additionally, these times periods are distinct from nominal conditions observed at SPL.Illustration of the aerosol size distribution from the APS for all three events described shown with the dashed lines , and are clearly distinct from nominal conditions shown with the solid line .. The corresponding elevated concentrations of bioaerosols and dust provide evidence that bioaerosols are lofted in conjunction with dust particles to the atmosphere. Soils in the Four Corners region were known to be covered by cryptobiotic crust containing cyanobacteria, fungi, lichen, and moss. However, the vast land disturbance of the late 1800s to present day has eliminated much of the mature state of cryptobiotic soils and replaced it with less stable surfaces with depleted nutrients. Because dust can act as ice nuclei, and further, some bioaerosols have been shown to also act as ice nuclei, the elevated concentrations of these atmospheric constituents could have important impacts on cloud formation and characteristics in the atmosphere. The evidence from these observations are consistent with others, and suggests the need to better characterize the biological component of larger particles in the atmosphere, and further, their impact of aerosol-cloud processes., water and land managers in the region are pursuing mitigation of dust emission to reduce this impact. Critical to this effort however is the capacity to better identify dust sources and in turn connect them to the associated disturbance, whether previous or ongoing. The capacity to detect varying concentrations of bioaerosols may provide additional capacity to identify provenance and contributing processes."
84,dust clouds,"Contrasting the impact of aerosols at northern and southern midlatitudes on heterogeneous ice formation. Three cloud data sets, each covering four months of observations, were recently recorded with a lidar at Punta Arenas 53 degrees S , Chile, at Stellenbosch 34 degrees S, near Cape Town , South Africa, and aboard the research vessel Polarstern during three north-south cruises. By comparing these observations with an 11-year cloud data set measured with a lidar at Leipzig 51 degrees N , Germany, the occurrence of heterogeneous ice formation as a function of cloud top temperature for very different aerosol conditions in the northern and southern hemisphere is investigated. Large differences in the heterogeneous freezing behavior in the mostly layered clouds are found. For example, <20%, 30%-40% and around 70% of the cloud layers with cloud top temperatures from -15 degrees C to -20 degrees C, showed ice formation over Punta Arenas, Stellenbosch, and Leipzig, respectively. The observed strong contrast reflects the differences in the free tropospheric aerosol conditions at northern midlatitudes, that are controlled by anthropogenic pollution, mineral dust, forest fire smoke, terrestrial biological material and high southern midlatitudes with clean marine conditions.

Rohwer 2011 , Contrasting the impact of aerosols at northern and southern midlatitudes on heterogeneous ice formation, Geophys. Res. Lett., 38, L17802, doi:10.1029/2011GL048532. , used to predict future climate change, properly reflect aerosol effects on ice formation and the subsequent impact on the production of rain in different clean to heavily polluted areas around the globe. The lidar study presented here is motivated by the question: Can we provide observational evidence for a strong impact of continental aerosols on heterogeneous ice formation? . In addition biological material pollen, bacteria, leaf fragments may contribute to efficient ice nucleation. At high southern latitudes over remote oceanic areas >50°S , continental aerosol particles are widely absent and even if present the most favorable large IN may already be removed by dry and wet deposition. Clean marine conditions prevail here. An approach to contrast cloud observations at high northern and southern midlatitudes was performed in the framework of the INCA Interhemispheric Differences in Cirrus Properties from Anthropogenic Emissions project that focused on cirrus evolution and properties.. Compared to spaceborne active remote sensing, ground-based systems have the advantage that cloud virgae can be studied to unambiguously identify heterogeneous ice nucleation. This information is essential, but can hardly be provided when using lidar platforms above the cloud layers because of strong multiple scattering effects and the frequent attenuation of the lidar beam by optically thick liquid-water layers above these virgae.. Recently, the impact of volcanic ash was investigated. We already found large differences in the heterogeneous freezing temperatures for Cape Verde and Leipzig. An unambiguous conclusion regarding the role and interaction of meteorological effects and aerosol-related effects could however not be drawn from these measurements alone. already indicated similar meteorological conditions in the free troposphere at these high midlatitudes north and south of the equator. Thus, a possible impact of aerosols on the initiation of ice nucleation should become visible by contrasting the cloud observations at Leipzig and Punta Arenas.RV indicates that our method provides a trustworthy view on cloud phase statistics.. The respective cloud top temperature for each observed cloud was calculated from GDAS1-data that are based on the global data assimilation system GDAS Global Data Analysis System, http://www.arl.noaa.gov/gdas.php . The analysis of the model-derived temperatures and temperatures from rarely launched nearby radiosonde ascents show deviations of the order of 1.5 K or less in the height range from 2 to 10 km. As can be seen in Figure 2 , the depth of liquid clouds was mostly below 1 km at both sites and the top heights of the liquid-water clouds mostly ranged from 1–6 km height. Cloud top heights of the mixed-phase clouds not presented show a broad distribution from typically 2–8 km height. Most of mixed-phase clouds were 500–1000 m in depth and less than 3 km thick when considering the virgae layer in the cloud depth calculation. The broad distribution of cloud depths in the case of ice-containing clouds is caused by cirrus and the associated deep virgae layers. All in all, the similarity in the cloud characteristics at both sites point to similar atmospheric conditions during cloud formations at high northern and southern midlatitudes. . The strongest increase in the ice-containing cloud fraction with decreasing temperature, expressing most efficient heterogeneous ice formation, is observed over Leipzig. The weakest increase is found for Punta Arenas. The increase in the ice-containing cloud fraction with decreasing temperature is even weaker for Punta Arenas when all clouds of the four-month period are considered. Less than 10%, <20%, about 30%–40% and around 70% of the cloud layers with cloud top temperatures from −15°C to −20°C, showed ice formation over Cape Verde, Punta Arenas, Stellenbosch/. In contrast, the aerosol concentration in the free troposphere at high southern midlatitudes can be regarded to be rather low, and the main particle source is the ocean. Punta Arenas is situated in the Antarctic low pressure belt that causes westerly air streams during most of the year. Thus maritime air masses dominate aerosol conditions throughout the troposphere. Sources for favorable coarse mode IN are absent. This conclusion is in agreement with the shipborne observations of Bigg  With decreasing temperature, the immersion freezing mode becomes more and more efficient. However, if soluble sea salt and other marine, sulfate containing particles are inside the droplets, ice formation may be significantly suppressed. That may explain the likewise slow increase of the ice-containing cloud fraction with decreasing temperature at Punta Arenas.[19]  By contrasting liquid-water and ice-containing cloud data sets observed with polarization lidar at several places at northern and southern midlatitudes and aboard the RV Polarstern a clear north-to-south decrease in the efficiency of heterogeneous ice formation was found. This decrease is well correlated with the decreasing contribution of anthropogenic aerosols and mineral dust particles to the overall aerosol load in the free troposphere when going from northern to southern hemispheric sites in or close to the Atlantic Ocean. The study documents the significant role of aerosol particles in the glaciation of shallow cloud layers in the northern hemisphere."
85,particles dust aerosol,"Atmospheric non-spherical particles optical properties from UV-polarization lidar and scattering matrix. In this contribution, the optical backscattering properties of atmospheric non-spherical particles are analyzed after long-range transport with a highly sensitive and accurate UV-polarization lidar. Far from the source region, the aerosol cloud is considered as a mixture of spherical s and non-spherical ns particles. Aerosols UV-depolarization serves as an independent means to discriminate ns from s-atmospheric particles. Vertical profiles of aerosols backscattering coefficient beta a and UV-depolarization ratio d a are provided for two ns-particles case studies, on volcanic ash and desert dust, in the troposphere of Lyon 45.76 degrees N, 4.83 degrees E, France . Achieved polarization-sensitivity and accuracy allows tracing different atmospheric layers with a 75 m-altitude resolution. The depolarization ratio delta a of the mixed a = {s, ns} aerosol cloud is then analyzed in the frame of the scattering matrix formalism. Observed delta a -values, which range from a few to 38.5% 19.5% for volcanic ash desert dust particles, only equal the intrinsic depolarization ratio of ns-particles when there is no detectable s-particle, and in the presence of s-particles, delta a is always below delta a, ns . By coupling our accurate lidar measurements with scattering matrix, we retrieved vertical profiles of backscattering coefficient, specific to ash dust particles, which is new. This ash dust specificity is then discussed within our error bars. We hence developed a methodology giving access to the number concentration vertical profile of specific particulate matter in the troposphere. Citation: Miffre, A., G. David, B. Thomas, and P. Rairoux 2011 , Atmospheric non-spherical particles optical properties from UV-polarization lidar and scattering matrix, Geophys. Res. Lett., 38, L16804, doi:10.1029/2011GL048310. . During transport from a source region to a place where intrusion episodes occur into the troposphere, non-spherical particles experience chemical reactivity, including potential humidification, which may strongly influence their size and their shape. Hence, a significant part of these particles becomes spherical and after long-range transport, a mixture of highly dispersed spherical s particles and aged non-spherical ns particles appear. The vertical distribution of atmospheric particles is generally retrieved by performing elastic-backscatter lidar remote sensing experiments, which provide a fast, reliable and unique interpretation of in-situ particles optical properties. The particles non-sphericity can be addressed by performing lidar-polarization measurements, as the particles' ability to depolarize laser light is mainly governed by their shape. Polarization sensitive lidar experiments have thus been achieved with desert dust and volcanic particles. The chosen laser wavelength is often in the visible spectral range while in the UV spectral range-measurements are recent and seldom. The retrieval of particles microphysical properties from such a size and shape dependent-vertical profile is however still challenging. For this reason, in situ remote sensing measurements are often coupled with laboratory measurements or/and numerical simulations. Many references exist in the literature and  In this contribution, a highly sensitive and accurate UV-polarization lidar experiment is used to analyze the optical backscattering properties of atmospheric ns-particles after long-range transport. Two case studies, on volcanic ash and desert dust particles, are analyzed. Far from the source region, the aerosol cloud can be considered as a mixture of s and ns-particles. In our experiment, this partition {s, ns} is deduced from a sensitive and accurate UV-polarization measurement. Scattering from small-sized particles is enhanced by the choice for UV-light. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 , we derive the depolarization ratio /a 1 for size parameters ranging from a few to approximately 20 at To separate backscattering from s and ns-particles, we performed an accurate polarization-sensitive elastic-backscatter lidar experiment, which provides the aerosol backscattering coefficient. However, such a comparison needs to be done with care as our retrieved N dust -concentrations are dust-specific.[16]  In this contribution, we analyzed the optical backscattering properties of an aerosol cloud, considered as a mixture of spherical s and non-spherical ns particles after long-range transport. Ns-particles are distinguished from s-particles with a sensitive and accurate lidar UV-depolarization experiment. We traced different aerosols layers having different polarization properties, containing both s and ns-particles, with a 75 m-altitude resolution. Two case studies, on volcanic ash and desert dust particles, have been analyzed. The observed variations of the depolarization ratios [2010]. As our methodology is ash dust -specific, we believe it will lead to new studies on atmospheric processes linked to these ns-particles, while volcanic eruptions occur more frequently and dust episodes should occur more and more due to the consequences of climate change. In addition, possible presence of internally-mixed particles could be a very interesting stage to develop, as an interference term of the proposed partitioning between s and ns-particles."
87,dust,"Evaluating the impact of assimilating CALIOP-derived aerosol extinction profiles on a global mass transport model. Coupled two/three-dimensional variational 2D/3DVAR assimilation of aerosol physical properties retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS , Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer MISR and Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization CALIOP satellite-borne instruments is described for the U. S. Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System NAAPS global aerosol mass transport model. Coupled 2D/3DVAR assimilation for NAAPS is evaluated for 48-hr forecast cycles, computed four times daily in six-hour intervals, versus stand-alone 2DVAR assimilation of MODIS and MISR aerosol optical depths AOD . Both systems are validated against AERONET ground-based sun photometer measurements of AOD. Despite a narrow nadir viewing swath and more than 2700 km of equatorial separation between orbits, satellite lidar data assimilation elicits a positive model response. Improvements in analysis and forecast AOD absolute errors are found over both land and maritime AERONET sites. The primary impact to the model from 3DVAR assimilation is the redistribution of aerosol mass into the boundary layer, though the process is sensitive to parameterization of vertical error correlation lengths.

Lett., 38, L14801, doi:10.1029/2011GL047737. , numerical forecast models of global aerosol distribution now benefit from data assimilation. For example, the first operational aerosol data assimilation system, the  NAAPS is a 1° × 1° global aerosol mass transport model that computes 6-day forecasts of smoke, dust, sulfate, sea salt and SO 2 mass concentration every six hours. NAAPS is driven by dynamic fields generated by the for sea salt, and for dust. Descriptions of the 2DVAR data assimilation system and its impact on system performance are given by , exhibit accuracies comparable to that of satellite retrievals. NAAPS forecasts are improved by 20–40% for both over land and over ocean AOD assimilation.; convert into a first-guess 3D analysis of aerosol mass concentration and extinction coefficient.. and over-land AOD products and Version 1 of an assimilation-grade MISR AOD product have been described. CALIOP-derived 0.532 μ m aerosol extinction coefficient profiles with corresponding uncertainties are generated during Step 2 using one-degree along-track averages of cloud-cleared signal profiles collected between 60°S–60°N that are assigned to the closest NAAPS grid point. An ‘observed’ aerosol extinction coefficient profile is iteratively derived from these data using a numerical inversion technique that is constrained by the model AOD solved at Step 2 AOD 2DVAR . Hence, this ‘observed’ profile and the first-guess extinction coefficient profile from the model for the same grid point have the same value of vertically-integrated extinction i.e., AOD 2DVAR . Derivation of the “lidar ratio” the layer-mean aerosol extinction-to-backscatter ratio , a by-product of the numerical inversion, allows for screening questionable ‘observations’ that are likely cloud contaminated.. L varies as a function of altitude, time e.g., season , and location e.g., land versus ocean . Secondary experiments and investigation of model sensitivity to L are described in Section 3 . Fixing L = 0.015 was found during testing to yield the most stable performance for primary model assessment. Shown in Figure 1b are cloud-cleared CALIOP one-degree along-track averaged signal profiles, described above and solved as part of Step 2, now scaled between 0.0 and 8.0 km MSL. Superimposed on these data are layer boundaries derived using a feature-finding algorithm that discriminates particulate i.e., aerosol particle scattering from that of the molecular atmosphere. Shown in Figure 1c is the NAAPS 00-hour model analysis at 0000 UTC 18 May 2007 of the 550 nm aerosol extinction coefficient from 1000.0 to 100.0 hPa, corresponding with the CALIPSO coordinates in Figure 1a . The model predicted a dust layer from 20°–35°N, but failed to resolve the near-surface layer between 27°–13°N. Shown in Figure 1d are CALIOP-derived retrievals of the aerosol extinction coefficient, again from Step 2. Conversion between 550 and 532 nm is done using a simple Angstrom exponent relationship predicated on the spectral AOD solved within NAAPS. Calculations of the pre-cursor “lidar ratio” step are shown in the inset of Figure 1d . The NAAPS reanalysis of 550 nm extinction coefficient is shown in Figure 1e after 3DVAR assimilation in Step 3. The vertical redistribution of aerosol particle mass is apparent, and represents a more accurate depiction of the layers profiled by CALIOP. The relative offset in absolute errors solved at the 12 and 36-hr steps for each of the profiles shown in Figure 2a is due to the non-linear influence of two inherent system processes. The first involves the 180° phase difference between data availability in one global quadrant of the model for assimilation at 00-hr where the sun is overhead MODIS, MISR, and CALIOP versus these specific forecast validation times when AERONET data become available but whose sectors were shroud in darkness at initialization CALIOP data assimilated only . Second, differences in AERONET AOD data availability and instrument distributions within the quadrants cause systematic variability in derived errors.. As shown in Figure 1 , and discussed further below, coupled 2D/3DVAR assimilation primarily causes particle redistribution from the free troposphere into the boundary layer, where deposition occurs. Therefore, mass is increasingly subject to removal from the model over the forecast interval, which is depicted as an increasing offset over time.. After assimilating CALIOP data however, mass concentrations near the surface layer are increased. A bi-modal structure is seen in the coupled 2D/3DVAR O-A profile. Use of a fixed setting for L is the primary deterministic factor influencing this result. However, secondary factors also impact this finding. First, a single assimilation step yields only intermediate convergence to a given CALIOP observation. Second, differences in resolution between the lidar profile and the depth of the sigma levels used within the model, which increase with height, can bias the vertical redistribution of aerosol mass caused by assimilation. a Two month June–July 2007 averaged CALIPSO minus NAAPS analysis extinction profiles O-A for both 2DVAR red and green lines , and coupled 2D/3DVAR grey and black lines cases, over both land and oceans see inset . b Similar to Figure 3a, but for the six-hour forecast O-F . c Similar to Figure 3a, but for O-A using a variable vertical background error correlation length. d Similar to Figure 3b, but for O-F using a variable vertical background error correlation length.  Figure 3c depicts coupled 2D/3DVAR system O-A profiles solved where L is varied from 0.015 at the surface and increasing to 0.045 by 450 hPa. Less fluctuation and improved convergence to zero are found throughout the model column, compared with corresponding results derived with a fixed L in Figure 3a . Similar improvement is found from the coupled 2D/3DVAR O-F analysis Figure 3d . It is physically realistic for L to increase with altitude. Applying a fixed L, however, aside from simplicity, still represents a reasonable model option. Since CALIOP-derived extinction profiles are constrained by AOD 2DVAR , they are correlated with NAAPS extinction profiles solved at Step 1. Therefore, varying L may induce a loss of aerosol mass, as larger values are assigned to high altitudes where aerosol concentrations are low. Second, L very likely varies with region particularly with respect to land versus ocean and diurnal cycle, for which a robust parameterization is presently unavailable. These findings ultimately indicate, however, how the model, and its apparent improvement, are sensitive to L, for which we conclude a more thorough assessment and 3D prognostic error model be considered as part of future model upgrades.. Nevertheless, the results described from Figure 2 illustrate that even with the limited CALIOP sensor swath, and with parameterized 3D error correlation lengths i.e., not solved using ensemble and/or Kalman filter techniques , a positive impact is made on the model. This is an encouraging result, which will only improve with future satellite lidar monitoring activities. Missions featuring high-spectral resolution measurements and a direct retrieval of the aerosol extinction coefficient would simplify the coupled 2D/3DVAR paradigm. Furthermore, a 3D prognostic error model is being developed for the coupled 2D/3DVAR NAAPS system using ground-based lidar validation that will optimize error correlation settings. The attention of mission planners, science teams and investigators tasked with raising the visibility of satellite lidar aerosol datasets for global aerosol visibility forecasting is vital to ensuring that these endeavors are pursued until operational status is attained. This paper represents a demonstration of potential, viability and system development necessary to achieve this goal."
55,dust impact climate aerosol,"Satellite observations of desert dust-induced Himalayan snow darkening. The optically thick aerosol layer along the southern edge of the Himalaya has been subject of several recent investigations relating to its radiative impacts on the South Asian summer monsoon and regional climate forcing. Prior to the onset of summer monsoon, mineral dust from southwest Asian deserts is transported over the Himalayan foothills on an annual basis. Episodic dust plumes are also advected over the Himalaya, visible as dust-laden snow surface in satellite imagery, particularly in western Himalaya. We examined spectral surface reflectance retrieved from spaceborne MODIS observations that show characteristic reduction in the visible wavelengths 0.47 mu m over western Himalaya, associated with dust-induced solar absorption. Case studies as well as seasonal variations of reflectance indicate a significant gradient across the visible 0.47 mu m to near-infrared 0.86 mu m spectrum VIS-NIR , during premonsoon period. Enhanced absorption at shorter visible wavelengths and the resulting VIS-NIR gradient is consistent with model calculations of snow reflectance with dust impurity. While the role of black carbon in snow cannot be ruled out, our satellite-based analysis suggests the observed spectral reflectance gradient dominated by dust-induced solar absorption during premonsoon season. From an observational viewpoint, this study underscores the importance of mineral dust deposition toward darkening of the western Himalayan snow cover, with potential implications to accelerated seasonal snowmelt and regional snow albedo feedbacks.  due to snow darkening, i.e., reduction of snow albedo due to enhanced solar absorption. Climate modeling simulations indicate absorbing aerosols, such as dust and black carbon BC , as major snow darkening agents leading to enhanced climate warming and accelerated snowmelt in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in Eurasia including the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau HTP . In addition to triggering snow albedo feedback processes, absorbing aerosols are also suggested to cause accelerated glacier retreat in the HTP, coinciding with increased BC emissions in south and east Asia in recent decades., accelerated snowmelt over the HTP, as well as perturbations to the Asian summer monsoon rainfall—partly due to enhanced solar absorption by natural and anthropogenic aerosols. Both the absorbing aerosol deposition and aerosol-induced atmospheric warming over snow are suggested to be important factors toward accelerated snowmelt in the HTP, particularly during the premonsoon season May–June . Prior to the onset of the summer monsoon, westerly wind-blown mineral dust from southwest Asian deserts and as far as from the Arabian Peninsula is transported over south Asia in multiple dust events each year. As a result, the aerosol loading peaks over northern India, during the transition of spring to summer months, with episodic dust influence observed to extend over the Himalaya, particularly in western Himalaya WH . Mixed with anthropogenic pollution, mineral dust forms a widespread vertically extended haze against the southern slopes of the Himalaya. Episodic dust plumes are also advected over the Himalaya, leading to dust-laden snow surface, as observed in satellite imagery Figure  1 . a Satellite image of a major dust outbreak over south Asia, on 9 June 2003 from Terra/MODIS, indicating visibly dust-laden snow surface in the western Himalaya WH ; b zoom-in over WH on 15 June 2003; c daily AOD variations over the foothills, south of the WH snow cover; d MODIS spectral surface reflectance on 15 June indicating the VIS-NIR gradient for WH 30°N–34°N, 76°E–80°E , with error bars of ±1σ representing pixel-level variability.. A recent study demonstrated the capability of satellite-derived estimation of dust radiative forcing in snow and showed large forcings over the Himalaya, from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS . The southern edge of the HTP, especially western Himalaya, is close to dust source regions; yet the possible effects of mineral dust deposition on snow albedo in the Himalaya is not well understood due to lack of observations. In this paper, we focus on the role of mineral dust toward snow darkening in the Himalaya. From an observational viewpoint, this study utilizes spaceborne measurements of reflectance over the Himalayan snow cover to infer the reduction of snow albedo by dust-induced solar absorption.. Reflectances from MODIS land bands in swath format, at seven wavelengths from 0.47 to 2.1 µm, were mapped onto a 0.01° × 0.01° spatial resolution ~1.2 × 1.2 km pixel size . In order to focus over snow surface, MODIS snow cover fraction SCF product was used as an indicator of fractional snow cover available within a MODIS footprint, at a spatial resolution of 500 m. Daily SCF swath data were also gridded to ~1.2 km pixel size for consistent colocation with reflectance data. The MODIS SCF is derived from the normalized difference snow index with overall accuracy of snow cover swath products reported as above 90%. A recent study, however, suggests that the MODIS SCF has lower accuracy than previously reported with an RMSE of 0.23. The SCF data set was further filtered and only considered for pixels with >99% snow fraction, in order to constrain our analysis for highly snow covered regions. An additional threshold of 0.3 was introduced, for R 0.47μm below which all spectral reflectance values are not considered in the analysis , to minimize subpixel contamination of snow with, e.g., vegetation/bare soil in inferring the role of dust absorption toward reduction of reflectance. The anomalous high aerosol loading, associated with the dust plume, is shown in Figure  1 c from daily variations of Terra/MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth AOD over a 1° × 1° region 31°N–32°N, 77°E–78°E south of the snow cover aerosol retrievals over snow are not available from MODIS . The aerosol loading is generally low AOD ~ 0.2–0.3 prior to the dust outbreak 5–7 June and sharply increases thereafter during the dust outbreak resulting in fourfold increase causing highest AOD on 9 June. The uncertainty of MODIS AOD over land is reported to be within ±0.05 ± 0.15*AOD. After the passage of dust storm, the AOD significantly reduced to lower values during 13–20 June. The persistence of darkening is further observed on 15 June, i.e., few days after the dust event Figure  1 b . The background conditions appear to be relatively clean on 15 June over the IGP and the mountain valley as indicated by lower AOD, see Supplementary Figure  1 , compared to 9 June; however, the WH snow cover still appears to be darkened due to probable dust deposition. have shown that dust particles effectively reduce snow albedo, especially around 0.4 µm, thus causing a significant gradient in the VIS-NIR spectrum. The shorter visible wavelengths are most sensitive to light-absorbing impurity, and therefore, the possibility of dust-induced absorption and related feedback processes toward accelerated snowmelt cannot be ruled out, especially with the VIS-NIR gradient over WH, as shown here.. Additionally, snowmelt along with exposure of glacier ice is also characterized by reduced albedo 0.5–0.6 in VIS-NIR as indicated by field-based spectral measurements. However, snow at higher elevations would remain dry and new snowfall can occur; therefore, the observed lower reflectance is a likely indicator that aged/contaminated snow dominates the satellite observed region of WH 30°N–34°N, 76°E–80°E . In addition, the MOD09 surface reflectance product, used here, is an apparent surface reflectance product, assuming a level surface—therefore, the dynamic range of the signal is affected by topography., thus suggesting increased dust deposition in late premonsoon relative to winter-spring over the western Himalaya. We also found even lower values of reflectance 0.37 ± 0.06 for MODIS band 8 0.412 µm during the dusty period 1–15 June indicating a stronger VIS-NIR gradient. However, R 0.412 µm is not available for bright snow pixels in the selected WH region, as this MODIS channel saturates for bright snow/clouds, and therefore, the reported R 0.412 µm is biased low. a Seasonal variations of spectral surface reflectance from February to June , shown as 15 day averages over WH snow cover error bars denote ±1σ standard deviation . b Absolute difference of surface reflectance between 0.47 and 0.86 µm, averaged for 6–15 June 2003. Positive difference is generally found over the Karakoram, while dust-laden WH and southern Hindu-Kush region are characterized by negative differences. Shaded region in gray represents no data/non-snow-covered regions. To further illustrate the effect of dust deposition leading to reduced snow reflectance, we modeled the reflectance of snow mixed with varying concentrations of dust impurity. We use the analytical bidirectional reflectance distribution function model of snow reflectance, which is particularly suited to multispectral remote sensing observations, and accounts for sensitivity to snow grain size and impurity in snow. The snow reflectance model and its various inputs are described in the supplementary material. One of the inputs to the model is imaginary part m im of the complex refractive index of ice, which is obtained from Warren and Brandt . This model input m im is modified to represent the imaginary part m imd of the complex refractive index of ice contaminated with dust by the following procedure. First, the absorption coefficient k for dust-contaminated snow was calculated using the formulation described in Yasunari et al ., which includes inputs of dust mass absorption coefficients shown in Supplementary Figure  3 and mass concentration of dust impurity in snow, as shown using different levels of impurity concentration in Figure  3 a. The imaginary part m imd of the complex refractive of ice, contaminated with dust, is then obtained from the absorption coefficient k of dust-contaminated snow using the general approximation by Wiscombe and Warren : Model sensitivity calculations of reflectance of a pure snow mixed with varying levels of dust impurity at solar zenith, viewing zenith, and relative azimuth angles of 30°, 20°, and 140°, respectively, and b reduction of TOA reflectance due to dust above clean snow, with VIS-NIR gradient shown as ratio of reflectance between 0.47 and 0.86 µm secondary y axis ., compared to that of mineral dust which is strongly absorbing in the blue bands 0.4–0.47 µm . With respect to the strong spectral gradient observed over WH Figures  1 and 2 , we infer that this is associated with a dust-dominated deposition scenario in the premonsoon season. Black carbon is relevant toward snow darkening and may amplify the overall albedo reduction, but from a remote sensing approach that we show here, dust-induced snow darkening seems to have a more dominant signal with reference to the spectral shape of reflectance. was used to calculate the radiative impact of dust overlying snow. The same dust optical model, corresponding to dust impurity in Figure  3 a, is used as input to the dust-overlying snow RTM calculations, in order to be consistent between the two scenarios. The aerosol single scattering albedo SSA at 0.47 µm is ~0.91, averaged for four dust size bins within 0.1–10 µm, representing moderately absorbing dust shown in Supplementary Figure  3 . In comparison to the shorter wavelength, reflectance at 0.86 µm is not very sensitive to dust loading resulting in the simulated gradient associated with enhanced absorption at 0.47 µm at higher optical depths, as indicated by the ratio 0.47 µm/0.86 µm  < 1 secondary y axis in Figure  3 b . This is due to the weakly absorbing property of the dust model SSA at 0.86 µm is 0.97 used here. The darkening at the shorter wavelength is caused due to multiple reflections, leading to enhanced absorption, between a bright surface snow in this case and the overlying absorbing aerosol layer dust above snow . Here the VIS-NIR gradient at TOA, is largely a function of aerosol optical properties e.g., SSA and the underlying snow surface characteristics pure vs. aged/contaminated snow , and its detection would depend on these two factors. Regarding the efficacy of dust-induced reduction, we think that, in comparison to dust above snow, dust deposition would have larger snow albedo reduction during premonsoon period. This is because once dust is deposited given there is less new snow accumulation during the premonsoon snowmelt season , it may induce a longer-term reduction of snow albedo by darkening and in turn lead to a positive feedback toward accelerated snowmelt. On the contrary, dust above snow could have measurable instantaneous radiative warming; however, once the dust layer is advected away or deposited, the atmospheric forcing significantly reduces.. Nonetheless, detailed ground-based measurements of partitioning of snow impurities and atmospheric aerosol composition, particularly dust and BC, as well as coincident snow albedo characterization in the western Himalaya are required to quantify the aerosol-snow radiative coupling in order to further understand effects of snow darkening. In addition to the critical role of deposition in snow darkening, associated with increasing anthropogenic emissions in south and east Asia, our study further suggests that naturally occurring transported dust can also potentially influence seasonal snow albedo feedback processes during the premonsoon period on an interannual scale. With reference to the monsoon, climate modeling has suggested several absorbing aerosol-mediated pathways in perturbing the monsoon circulation. Thus, the role of mineral dust deposition, in influencing seasonal warming over the Himalaya, may also contribute toward the overall absorbing aerosol impact on the summer monsoon circulation over southern Asia. Of particular importance and with relevance to dust influx is the western Himalaya—source of two major rivers Indus and Ganges , which provide major freshwater resource to the downstream population of southern Asia."
63,aerosol,"Quantifying the impact of dust on heterogeneous ice generation in midlevel supercooled stratiform clouds. Dust aerosols have been regarded as effective ice nuclei IN , but large uncertainties regarding their efficiencies remain. Here, four years of collocated CALIPSO and CloudSat measurements are used to quantify the impact of dust on heterogeneous ice generation in midlevel supercooled stratiform clouds MSSCs over the 'dust belt'. The results show that the dusty MSSCs have an up to 20% higher mixed-phase cloud occurrence, up to 8 dBZ higher mean maximum Z e Z e _max , and up to 11.5 g/m 2 higher ice water path IWP than similar MSSCs under background aerosol conditions. Assuming similar ice growth and fallout history in similar MSSCs, the significant differences in Z e _max between dusty and non-dusty MSSCs reflect ice particle number concentration differences. Therefore, observed Z e _max differences indicate that dust could enhance ice particle concentration in MSSCs by a factor of 2 to 6 at temperatures colder than -12 degrees C. The enhancements are strongly dependent on the cloud top temperature, large dust particle concentration and chemical compositions. These results imply an important role of dust particles in modifying mixed-phase cloud properties globally. Citation: Zhang, D., Z. Wang, A. Heymsfield, J. Fan, D. Liu, and M. Zhao 2012 , Quantifying the impact of dust on heterogeneous ice generation in midlevel supercooled stratiform clouds, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L18805, doi:10.1029/2012GL052831. . Dust particles have been widely recognized as efficient IN and as one of the major IN sources from various remote sensing observations, field campaigns and laboratory measurements. Model simulations also show that ice particle number concentrations in mixed-phase clouds are largely impacted by the compositions and size distributions of dust particles. Although the major dust source regions are located over the ‘dust belt’, including the North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and East Asia, dust particles can be ejected into the free troposphere and transported around the globe; thus, these dust particles have a global impact. Therefore, understanding the impact of dust on ice generation plays an important role in disentangling the complicated relationships between aerosols and IN concentrations in clouds.. . Thus, more observations are needed to understand and resolve these uncertainties. Thus far, observations of the impacts of dust on ice generation on a global scale are still scarce, and no IN parameterizations used in current climate models have been developed or evaluated using satellite measurements. In this letter, we present a quantitative estimation of the impact of dust on ice generation in midlevel supercooled stratiform clouds MSSCs over the ‘dust belt’ by employing four years of collocated CALIPSO and CloudSat measurements.. . The close flying formation of CloudSat and CALIPSO provides almost simultaneous radar and lidar measurements globally. As illustrated by . MSSCs represent a “natural laboratory” for studying ice generation in clouds because of their less-complex dynamic environments and well-defined vertical thermodynamic structure. A thin, supercooled liquid-dominated in both concentration and water content mixed-phase layer usually less than ∼500 m is generally located at the upper part of MSSCs, and falling ice crystals are located below.. Therefore, we must rely on the dust layer being detected between clouds or surrounding clouds to infer whether MSSCs are affected by dust particle. If dust layers are detected near either one side or both sides of an MSSC system and the dust layers extend up to the height of the MSSC layer, this MSSC layer is considered to be affected by dust particles and is referred to a dusty MSSC. Figures 1a–1d present a dusty MSSC case with a cloud top at ∼6 km and a temperature of ∼−10°C. Based on the CALIPSO measurements, given in Figures 1a and 1b , elevated dust layers are detected on both sides of MSSCs, with the top and bottom layers located at approximately 6 km and 3 km, respectively. CloudSat Z e measurements, given in Figure 1c , show conspicuous ice virga below the mixed-phase layer.An example of dusty MSSC: a CALIOP TAB profiles at 532 nm; b CALIOP depolarization profiles at 532 nm; c CloudSat CPR radar reflectivity profiles; d identified dust layers and MSSC; e global distribution of dusty MSSCs in terms of numbers of profiles in 2.5° × 2.5°grid boxes from four years of collocated CALIPSO/CloudSat measurements. Dust particles from different source regions may have different ice nucleating abilities because of their different chemical compositions and size distributions. Therefore, the dusty MSSCs are separated into four sub-regions for further analyses based on the regional source of the dust and the transported distance, as indicated in Figure 1e . Region 1 represents long-range transported dust, which might be coated with soluble materials during the transportation and have reduced IN capability. The dust particles in region 2 and region 3 are near both the Saharan and Saudi Arabian dust source regions. Dust particles in region 4 are transported over eastern China from the Gobi desert and may interact with pollutant aerosols, which could change their dust ice nucleating ability. Non-dusty MSSCs in the ‘dust belt’ might still be influenced by background dust particles that are difficult to detect by CALIOP. Therefore, we also include MSSCs in the same longitude and latitude ranges in the Southern Hemisphere for comparison. These areas are referred to as the ‘South Regions’ Figure 1e . In total, ∼2.6 × 10 6 ‘South Regions’ MSSC profiles are identified.. Below the liquid-dominated mixed-phase cloud layer, ice crystals continue to grow and fall until they reach the level below the ice-saturation condition. This simple ice generation and growth pattern in MSSCs offers opportunities to use Z e measurements to quantitatively infer the ice concentration. Under similar meteorological conditions in terms of CTT and liquid water path LWP , ice crystal growths in MSSCs are expected to be statistically identical. offered collocated Z e and ice size distribution measurements. Wyoming Cloud Lidar WCL and Wyoming Cloud Radar WCR measurements Figures 2a and 2b show a typical MSSC we are interested in and the aircraft flew below the clouds to measure ice crystal size distributions. Figure 2c shows that all ice particle size distributions normalized by the correspondent total ice concentration and binned with Z e _max were similar to each other. Figure 2d compares Z e calculated using measured particle size distributions and the mean normalized particle size distribution, with the same total concentration. It indicates that usage of the same normalized size distribution in this MSSC only causes approximately 0.3 dB biases of Z e , with a standard deviation of 1.7 dB. There are few data points with more than 2 dB differences, which could be caused by the lower LWP compared with the rest of the cloud. Considering possible fluctuations caused by small 2D-C sampling volume, this case confirms that it is appropriate to assume the same ice distribution shape for similar MSSCs. a A MSSC system detected by WCL during ICE-L on December 10th, 2007, the lidar power is uncalibrated attenuated backscattering; b Z e structure from WCR and the white line in the middle indicating aircraft level; c normalized ice particle size distributions from 2D-C measurements and binned with Z e _max; d calculated Z e using measured ice particle size distributions and mean normalized ice particle size distribution. The dashed lines are ±2 dB lines.. However, at temperatures warmer than −10°C, Z e _max might also be affected by supercooled drizzles near the cloud top, but it is less likely a problem for these MSSCs because they are geometrically thin. When ice particles are detected based on the Z e thresholds, the MSSC is regarded as being in a mixed-phase state. The mixed-phase fractions, defined as the fractions of ice containing MSSCs to all MSSCs, increase with decreasing CTT for all three groups, as shown in Figure 3d . The mixed-phase fractions for ‘South Regions’ compare pretty well with those from . Approximately 98% of dusty MSSCs are in the mixed-phase when the cloud top temperature was ∼−15°C, while the non-dusty and ‘South Region’ cases only reach this magnitude of mixed-phase fraction below a CTT of ∼−30°C Figure 3d . However, the supercooled liquid cloud layers without detectable ice could persist down to temperatures as low as −30°C, especially in the ‘South Regions’. a The occurrence of dusty MSSCs in terms of CTT and Z e _max within the TAB value of 0.31–0.45 sr −1 km −1 ; b for non-dusty MSSCs; c for ‘South Regions’ MSSCs. d Mean mixed-phase occurrence at given CTT for dusty, non-dusty and ‘South Regions’ MSSCs. e Same as Figure 3d, but for the mean Z e _max of mixed-phase MSSCs. f Same as Figure 3d, but for the mean IWP of mixed-phase MSSCs.. The local minima of mean Z e _max at ∼−10°C and ∼−20°C are caused by the slow growth of an isometric habit, and the maximum mean Z e _max at ∼−15°C corresponded to the rapid growth of dendritic habit. For the ‘South Regions’ and non-dusty cases, the increasing mean Z e _max as CTT decreases from ∼−20°C reflects the general behavior of increasing ice number concentration as temperatures decrease due to slow ice growth at colder temperatures. For each group, MSSCs have a wide range of Z e _max at a given CCT, which could be due to different ice concentrations linked to different aerosols or the different life stages of MSSCs. However, the systematically higher mean Z e _max for dusty cases relative to the other two groups indicates that dust contributes to the high ice concentrations in MSSCs under similar meteorological conditions, as further discussed below., from the radar-detected cloud top to its base. Although random errors of IWCs from the relationship could be large, the statistic mean errors are small and similar for the three groups of MSSCs. The IWP increases significantly with decreasing CTT for three groups. The mean IWPs of dusty MSSCs are statistically larger than those of the non-dusty and ‘South Regions’ cases when the CTT was colder than −12°C. Overall, the mean IWP for the dusty, non-dusty and ‘South Regions’ cases are 23.4, 19.7 and 11.9 g/m 2 , respectively, which means that the mean IWP for dusty MSSCs is ∼19% higher than that of the non-dusty cases and ∼97% higher than that of the ‘South Regions’ cases. The 3.7 g/m 2 increase of IWP between dusty and non-dusty and 11.5 g/m 2 increase between the dusty and ‘South Regions’ MSSCs could cause a significant change in the cloud radiative forcing CRF , based on the previous studies.. Considering similar or higher dust concentrations at warmer temperatures, the decreasing Z e _max difference indicates that the effectiveness of dust acting as IN decreases as the CTT increases when the CTT is warmer than −20°C. For MSSCs with a CTT colder than −20°C, the Z e _max differences decrease as the CTT decreases. This could be a result of decreasing dust concentration with height and/or increasing IN effectiveness of background aerosols at cold temperatures. a Z e _max differences between dusty, non-dusty and ‘South Regions’ MSSCs in terms of CTT. b Z e _max differences between dust and ‘South Regions’ MSSCs for the four sub-regions as shown in Figure 1e ., to Kaolinite is generally higher in dust from Asia than that from Africa. [2009] also showed that the ice-nucleating ability of dust particles is deactivated when they are coated with soluble materials after long-range transportation, as is the case in region 1.[17]  Four years of collocated CALIPSO lidar and CloudSat radar measurements are used to quantitatively estimate the impact of dust on heterogeneous ice generation in MSSCs. This large dataset provides robust evidence that statistically supports the assertion that dust particles are efficient IN at temperatures colder than −10°C. We show that dusty MSSCs are more likely to produce ice particles and contain an up to 20% higher mixed-phase cloud occurrence under similar meteorological conditions. Dusty MSSCs also have a higher IWP of up to 11.5 g/m 2 than that of the ‘South Regions’ cases, which could result in a significant change of the cloud radiative forcing of MSSCs'. Because the Z e _max differences among similar MSSCs primarily reflect the ice particle number concentration differences, observed Z e _max differences indicate that dust can enhance ice concentration in MSSCs by a factor of 2 to 6, compared with background aerosol conditions. The ice concentration enhancements are strongly dependent on the CTT and dust particle properties, such as their size and chemical compositions. Our ongoing studies are refining an approach using CloudSat and CALIPSO measurements to better determine dust concentrations and correlate them with the ice generation in MSSCs. Because of the high sensitivities of liquid-phase properties in mixed-phase clouds on IN concentration, these results indicate that reliable simulations of dust impacts on ice generation in climate models are critical to capturing aerosol-cloud-radiation-dynamics feedback."
67,clouds aerosol,"Biomass burning as a potential source for atmospheric ice nuclei: Western wildfires and prescribed burns. The sources, abundance and nature of atmospheric particles that serve as ice nuclei IN for cold cloud formation remain some of the most important, yet poorly-characterized, features of aerosol-cloud interactions that indirectly affect climate. Although a great deal of effort has focused on characterizing the ice nucleating ability of mineral dusts, less is known about carbonaceous particles. A primary source for carbonaceous IN is from biomass combustion. Here we report new measurements of IN activity at -30 degrees C and above water saturation from biomass burning generated particles from prescribed burns and wildfires in the western US. These measurements suggest a range of IN activity, with variability largely dependent on the intensity of the fire. Although the fraction of particles generated during burns which serve as IN is quite small, the large numbers of particles generated in fires make biomass burning a potentially important source of IN to the atmosphere.

In mixed-phase clouds, primary ice formation occurs via heterogeneous nucleation involving aerosol particles that catalyze ice formation ice nuclei or IN . Biomass burning emissions and are a potentially prolific source of IN, and represent a significant contribution to ambient levels of organic fine particulate matter by mass, even after dilution during transport. Although not all smokes have been found to impact ice nucleation, remote sensing provides further evidence that some types of biomass burning particles impact cloud ice formation. An increase of IN, coupled with more water transport into the freezing regime in smoke plumes, could have a dramatic effect on cloud extent and precipitation processes... Particles were processed above water saturation at −30°C. Under these conditions, the CFDC directly measures IN activating by condensation/immersion freezing. For these processing conditions, ambient background IN number concentrations are often ≤10 L −1 . We made measurements during five fires in Colorado and Wyoming, and in one case of smoke from long range transport. All measurements were conducted during daylight hours, except for the Medano wildfire, which extended to 10 PM local time. Details of each sampling period are given in Table 1 ."
60,dust climate,"Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia. The Kimberley region of northwest Australia contains one of the World's largest collections of rock art characterised by two distinct art forms; the fine featured anthropomorphic figures of the Gwion Gwion or Bradshaw paintings, and broad stroke Wandjina figures. Luminescence dating of mud wasp nests overlying Gwion Gwion paintings has confirmed an age of at least 17,000 yrs B.P. with the most recent dates for these paintings from around the mid-Holocene 5000 to 7000 yrs B.P. . Radiocarbon dating indicates that the Wandjina rock art then emerged around 3800 to 4000 yrs B.P. following a hiatus of at least 1200 yrs. Here we show that a mid-Holocene ENSO forced collapse of the Australian summer monsoon and ensuing mega-drought spanning approximately 1500 yrs was the likely catalyst of this change in rock art. The severity of the drought we believe was enhanced through positive feedbacks triggered by change in land surface condition and increased aerosol loading of the atmosphere leading to a weakening or failure of monsoon rains. This confirms that pre-historic aboriginal cultures experienced catastrophic upheaval due to rapid natural climate variability and that current abundant seasonal water supplies may fail again if significant change in ENSO occurs. Citation: McGowan, H., S. Marx, P. Moss, and A. Hammond 2012 , Evidence of ENSO mega-drought triggered collapse of prehistory Aboriginal society in northwest Australia, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L22702, doi:10.1029/2012GL053916.  , Norse Greenland and Anasazi North America .. The most dramatic legacy left by these early inhabitants are thousands of rock art figures known as Gwion Gwion or Bradshaw paintings Figure 1 . Luminescence dating of mud wasp nests overlying Gwion Gwion paintings indicate an age of at least 17,000 yrs B.P., which is supported by their depictions of the marsupial lion Thylacoleo carnifex which is known to have become extinct in the late Pleistocene. The most recent dates are from the mid-Holocene 5000 to 7000 yrs B.P. . The emergence of the broad stroke Wandjina rock art Figure 1 is then recorded occurring around 3800 yrs B.P. following a hiatus in painting of rock art of at least 1200 yrs. These two vastly different forms of rock art have led to conjecture and controversy that Gwion Gwion paintings are a legacy of a culture predating present day Aboriginal inhabitants, and that their demise is recorded in their rock art as images of conflict, possibly over dwindling resources. However, the cause of their disappearance and the emergence of Wandjina rock art more than 1200 yrs latter had remained unknown until now.Examples of a Gwion Gwion rock art and b Wandjina rock art photographs courtesy of Kimberley Foundation Australia ., and a climate more arid than present during the last glacial maximum 18,000 to 24,000 yrs B.P. , that transitioned to humid conditions around 14,000 yrs B.P.. Intense monsoon seasons followed through the early to mid-Holocene which resulted in the establishment of a perennial Lake Mulan in the southern Kimberley at levels thought to be higher than under the modern climate regime. Northeast Australia then appears to have become drier during the mid to late Holocene with studies drawing a possible link to the emergence of enhanced ENSO conditions around 5000 yrs B.P.. However, the climate of the remote Kimberley region of northwest Australia during this period has remained unknown. which confirmed that this section of core overlapped with the disappearance of Gwion Gwion rock art and the emergence of Wandjina rock art.Errors for 14 C calibrated dates represent 68.2% probabilities estimated using OxCal.. Rates of dust and fluvial sediment deposition to the mound spring were determined using a trace element provenance model. This approach uses the concentration of trace elements found to behave conservatively in the mound spring and during transport and deposition. In the Black Springs core 18 elements Cs, Rb, Th, La, Ce, Pr, Nb, Li, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Sc, Dy, Y, Ti and Ga were found to demonstrate conservative behaviour and were therefore used to provenance the sediment. In this study sediment deposited in the mound spring was assumed to be sourced from one of two end-members groups; either aeolian dusts or local fluvial sediments, or an admixture of the two.. The outputs of this were used to calculate the deposition rates of dust and fluvial sediment in the core through time Figure 2 .Pollen and charcoal record developed from analysis of the Black Spring core.. A pollen diagram was then produced using TG View and was divided into zones based on the results of a stratigraphically constrained classification undertaken by CONISS Constrained Incremental Sums of Squares cluster analysis . and a corresponding increase in population. Deposition by fluvial processes of local sediments in the mould spring was minimal 0.2 – 2.2 g m −2 from the start of the record to about 3000 yrs B.P. A small increase in fluvial sedimentation between approximately 4600 to 4200 yrs. B.P. is coeval with a pronounced increase in Triglochin dubia Figure 2 indicating an enhanced hydrology and wetter climate. Fluvial sedimentation increased from around 3000 yrs. B.P. to approximately 7.8 g m −2 corresponding to increase in the presence of ferns and aquatics, followed by a decrease coeval with increased deposition of long travelled dusts. This indicates that anticyclonic weather patterns became more frequent over central and northern Australia again directing dry south-easterly winds over the Kimberley. Collectively, these results confirm that the climate of the Kimberley became much drier at this time Figure 2 until around 1300 to 1100 yrs. B.P. when it transitioned abruptly to conditions similar to today. This is shown in our record with the establishment of the contemporary vegetation assemblage Figure 2 and increased fluvial sedimentation reflecting an enhanced hydrology of the mound spring Figure 3 as a result of increased summer monsoon rainfall.. For example, Haberle . Concurrent with the onset of this arid phase which we confirm affected the Kimberley are the most recent and possibly last Gwion Gwion paintings. The artists of these elegant anthropomorphic figures therefore appear to have abandoned the Kimberley concurrent with an increasingly arid climate as the monsoon became less reliable and possibly failed for long periods.. In the language of the Wunambul, Wororra and Ngarinyin people of the Kimberley, “Wandjina” is the Rain Spirit, perhaps used by them to signify return of monsoonal rains sometime around 4000 yrs B.P. following 1500 yrs of drought and unreliable monsoon rains. A more arid period followed around 2400 to 1300 yrs. B.P. which is coeval with ENSO variability reaching or exceeding modern values. Only after this arid phase is there unequivocal evidence of a transition to the modern summer Australian monsoon climate. This was associated with a pronounced increase in charcoal in the sediment core indicating increased presence of fire in the landscape, possibly as a result of a larger Aboriginal population and increase in woody vegetation. The pollen record shows that this was coeval with a pronounced increase in aquatics such as Triglochin dubia confirming a significant and reliable water supply Figure 2 .. The trigger of such a strong response that resulted in a weakened or intermittent northwest Australian monsoon from around 6000 yrs and, again from 2400 to 1300 yrs. B.P., we believe was the onset of modern ENSO periodicities and increase in intensity and/or frequency of ENSO. Palaeo-environmental evidence from across the tropical Pacific of ENSO forced changes in climate around these times are supported by coupled ocean–atmosphere climate modelling studies. ENSO triggers a complex chain of land-ocean–atmosphere interactions that may suppress monsoon activity through disruption of positive moisture-advection feedback. We believe that this occurred in the mid to late Holocene as a result of reduced latent heat flux transfer to the troposphere over the cooler ENSO west Pacific Warm Pool northwest of Australia.. Further positive feedback would come from reduced soil moisture and higher land surface albedo due to vegetation dieback. The associated suppression of convection would reduce onshore moisture advection, thereby increasing aridity. Our research shows that the rapid onset of these conditions in the Kimberley in the mid-Holocene most likely lead to the demise of the Gwion Gwion artists.. This is contrary to the conventional view that Australian Aboriginals lived a highly sustainable hunter-gather existence in which their knowledge of the landscape meant they adapted to climate variability with little impact.[17]  Here we have shown the first evidence of significant rapid change in the monsoon over northwest Australia during the mid- to late Holocene. This was linked to enhanced ENSO and associated breakdown of positive moisture-advection onto the Kimberley region, thereby allowing the Southern Hemisphere subtropical ridge to extend further north. Palynological and sedimentological evidence from the Black Springs site confirmed that the failure of the monsoon resulted in prolonged aridity coeval with major change in rock art. We conclude that ENSO forced change of the northwest Australian monsoon lead to change in artists of the Kimberley rock art."
61,dust impact aerosol ocean,"The influence of the SAL and lightning on tropospheric ozone variability over the Northern Tropical Atlantic: Results from Cape Verde during 2010. We present results for multiple Saharan Air Layer SAL events and their relationship to tropospheric ozone mixing ratios that were observed in the Eastern Atlantic during the summer of 2010 using ozonesondes. In particular, 5 SAL events are sampled during 2010 in Cape Verde indicting a reduction of ozone mixing ratios throughout much of the SAL layer, except near the base of the SAL. In this layer of enhanced ozone mixing ratio, we find increases of 20-30 ppb in some cases between non-SAL and SAL conditions. In addition, ozone concentrations are enhanced above the SAL layer, with trajectories suggesting enhancements by lightning from the middle/upper troposphere with outflow from Africa. Additional aircraft measurements are required to examine the chemical and aerosol distributions from the Marine Boundary Layer MBL through the upper troposphere to determine the heterogeneous chemical processes related to reduced ozone mixing ratio, and further quantify elevated ozone mixing ratios at the base of the SAL and above the SAL.

Lett., 39, L20810, doi:10.1029/2012GL053532. . In the upper troposphere lightning can produce NO X LNOx which can increase ozone mixing ratios. There is strong evidence to support the cross-equatorial transport of enhanced ozone mixing ratios from biomass burning in the Southern Hemisphere to the Guinea region. During the wet season, June, July and August JJA , there is a north-south gradient of ozone mixing ratio in the lower troposphere with higher values found in the Sahelian region North and lower ozone mixing ratios in the guinea region south . is also likely to influence tropospheric ozone during individual dust events. The transport of dust from the African Continent across the Tropical Atlantic during JJA occurs in the lower to middle troposphere within the Saharan Air Layer SAL . The SAL is associated with dry, stable air in the lower to middle troposphere along with elevated dust loadings... However, entrainment from the free troposphere and elevated NO X mixing ratios that are transported from the African continent can lead to the enhancement of ozone mixing ratios.; d examine elevated ozone mixing ratios just above the top of the SAL. and the Worldwide Lightning Location Network WWLLN data are used to characterize the wind flow in 400 hPa and identify lightning strikes during the period of 25 June to 8 July 2010. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer MODIS sensors provide aerosol optical thickness AOT on daily basis, which is averaged over the area between 16–18°N and 26–23°W. Ground-based estimates of AOT at 550 nm are provided by Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET which is located at Sal, Cape Verde 16.7°N, 22.9°W . The SAL vertical profile of relative humidity shows that it is drier throughout most of the atmosphere when compared to non-SAL conditions, but especially in the lower troposphere between 925–750 hPa and again in the middle troposphere near 450 hPa Figure 1c . The top of the SAL is located at approximately 500 hPa, where there is an increase in relative humidity. In these locations, the relative humidity is lower by 20–40%, with the lower tropospheric reduction fitting the conventional model of the SAL. The vertical profile of ozone shows that there are larger ozone mixing ratios up to 5 ppb from the surface through 800 hPa followed by smaller ozone mixing ratios through 500 hPa for SAL conditions Figure 1d ., a moistening at the top of the SAL layer is found near 500 hPa followed by a drying in the upper troposphere for nearly all of the ozonesondes launches.Vertically averaged 500-meter columns of: a relative humidity and b ozone mixing ratio for all ozone profiles 26 June–17 July . Units are in percent for relative humidity and ppb for ozone mixing ratio., and the observed low ozone mixing ratios in the presence of the SAL between 850–500 hPa are consistent with aircraft measurements of  The vertical profile of temperature at Cape Verde shows a strong temperature inversion on 28 June, which is 4–5°C warmer than the inversion on 26 or 30 June and larger than the average profile Figure 3a . The warm air associated with the SAL is also considerably drier on 28 June relative to 26 and 30 June. The driest air associated with the SAL event is near 900 hPa with RH values less than 10%. In fact the entire 925–600 hPa column on 28 June is drier than 26 June as the SAL enters the region. A moistening of the atmosphere near the top of the SAL is found with RH values recovering to near 70% at 550 hPa, followed by another dry layer above 450 hPa Figure 3b . The SAL is replaced by a humid air mass on 30 June, with relative humidity values in the 60–95% range from the surface through approximately 500 hPa.Vertical profiles of: a temperature; b relative humidity; c ozone mixing ratio for case study 1 26, 28 and 30 June . Vertical profiles of: d temperature; e relative humidity; f ozone mixing ratio for case study 2 30 June, 1, 2, 3 July .. In the middle and upper troposphere ozone mixing ratios approach 100 ppb on 28 June near 400 hPa with lower ozone-mixing ratio values of 60–65 ppb found on 26 and 30 June. Similar to Case 1 an increase in ozone mixing ratio is found near 925 hPa with values of 35–40 ppb in this shallow layer. Ozone mixing ratios double from 15 ppb on 30 June to 30 ppb on 1 July and further increase to 37 ppb on 3 July. In contrast ozone mixing ratios from 900–500 hPa ozone mixing ratios decrease from 25–30 ppb 30 June to near 15 ppb on 2 July once again implying ozone destruction Figure 3f . Above the SAL layer, ozone mixing ratios values increase from approximately 40–50 ppb on 1,2 July and 60–70 ppb on 3 July.. This SAL event is associated with very strong winds near the surface and may have several source regions Mauritania, Mali in addition to the primary source region in Algeria. Visible satellite images show the heavy dust layer reaching Cape Verde during the afternoon of 8 July. Figure 4a shows the vertical profile of temperatures from Cape Verde, with the temperature inversion being lifted from near 950 hPa on 6 July to 850 hPa on 8 July.Vertical profiles of: a temperature; b relative humidity; c ozone mixing ratio for case study 3 6, 7, 8 July . Similar to the earlier cases where the SAL was present, there is an increase in ozone mixing ratios near the base of the SAL, with values increasing from 25 ppb on 6 July to near 50 ppb on 7 July. On 6 and 7 July there is a decrease in ozone mixing ratio above the base of the SAL to 500 hPa with lower values on 7 July, relative to the average ozone mixing ratio profile. However, unlike the earlier case studies, there is a large increase in ozone mixing ratio on 8 July from 850–500 hPa relative to the prior two days when the SAL was present. This increase in ozone mixing ratio corresponds to a very high dust loading which was elevated in height as seen in Figure 1a and noted by  We present the first published ozonesondes study of tropospheric ozone variability associated with the SAL from Cape Verde. We present 3 case studies where AOT values indicate that dust was present within the SAL layer. Our findings show that the vertical profiles of ozone are significantly altered in the presence of the SAL with lower tropospheric flow coming from Africa. In particular we find: a an increase in ozone mixing ratios at the base of the SAL in each case study, which was not present under non-SAL conditions. b A reduction in ozone mixing ratio from 850–500 hPa under SAL conditions when compared to non-SAL conditions, except for 8 July when there is an increase in ozone mixing ratio between 900 and 500 hPa when compared to 6–7. The loss of ozone may have occurred through heterogeneous chemical reactions on aerosol surfaces, the formation of nitrate particles leading to a loss of nitrogen or the reduction of important radicals associated with ozone production. c Above 500 hPa, the ozone mixing ratios rapidly increased with a range of 60 to nearly 100 ppb in the 400–300 hPa layer which is most likely linked to production of LNO X over West Africa and transported westward towards Cape Verde. The production of LNO X leading to an increase in downstream O 3 mixing ratios over the tropical Atlantic is consistent with Global Chemical Transport Model GCTM results.. They suggest the possibility of denitrification by water stressed microbes on Saharan and Sahelian aerosols in the presence of higher water vapor amounts. Higher water vapor amounts could be vertically exchanged between the top of the moist MBL and the base of the SAL, through diffusion or turbulent fluxes, leading to an increase in NO X and the production of O 3 . There is evidence of higher surface NO X and O 3 when during the winter season when the air masses are coming from Africa although it is not clear what role individual dust events in day-to-day variability.[24]  This work implies that additional tropospheric aircraft observations are required to characterize and quantify the distribution of aerosols, O 3 , NO and other O 3 precursors over the Sahara and Eastern Atlantic. Such measurements will help to define the processes that influence tropospheric ozone variability as it relates to the SAL, dust aerosols and lightning. The variability in tropospheric mixing ratios also implies that important factors must be taken into account for GCTMs and regional chemistry models. These factors include: surface sources of dust, heterogeneous chemistry, halogen chemistry and lightning parameterizations."
62,particles aerosol,"Impacts of chemical reactivity on ice nucleation of kaolinite particles: A case study of levoglucosan and sulfuric acid. Changes in the ice nucleation properties of mineral dust particles due to soluble coatings are still not well understood. Here we show that the reactivity with soluble materials deposited on the surfaces of kaolinite particles is an important factor affecting the ice nucleation properties of the particles. Using kaolinite particles treated with levoglucosan or H2SO4 i.e., non-reactive and reactive materials, respectively , we investigated the fraction of particles capable of nucleating ice at temperatures ranging from -34 degrees C to -26 degrees C. Below water saturation, both the levoglucosan and H2SO4 coatings similarly reduced the ice nucleating ability of kaolinite particles. Above water saturation, however, only the H2SO4 coatings reduced the ice nucleating ability of the particles, particularly at warmer temperatures. We suggest that the absence or presence of surface chemical reactions plays an important role in determining the number concentrations of ice crystals formed from mineral dust ice nuclei under mixed-phase cloud conditions. Citation: Tobo, Y., P. J. DeMott, M. Raddatz, D. Niedermeier, S. Hartmann, S. M. Kreidenweis, F. Stratmann, and H. Wex 2012 , Impacts of chemical reactivity on ice nucleation of kaolinite particles: A case study of levoglucosan and sulfuric acid, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L19803, doi:10.1029/2012GL053007. . Two major possible pathways for heterogeneous ice nucleation involving mineral dust particles are deposition ice nucleation ice formation on the surfaces of insoluble nuclei from ice-supersaturated water vapor and immersion/condensation freezing ice formation during or following the condensational growth of aqueous droplets containing insoluble nuclei . Typically, the former mechanism begins to be activated at ice-supersaturated conditions below water saturation, and the latter ensues above water saturation, although it may occur in solution droplets at sufficiently low temperatures to overcome the freezing point depression effects of solutes., and their ice nucleation properties can be modified depending on the conditions of the particle surfaces. Laboratory studies have shown that a wide variety of soluble materials can alter the ice nucleating ability of mineral dust particles below water saturation. On the other hand, the impacts of such materials on the immersion/condensation freezing processes above water saturation may be more complicated. For example, recent experiments at −30°C with different preparations of Arizona test dust ATD particles have suggested that the uptake of HNO 3 has no apparent impact on their ice nucleating ability in the immersion/condensation freezing regime, while the uptake of H 2 SO 4 can reduce their ice nucleating ability.. Levoglucosan is known as a tracer for biomass burning and is derived from combustion of cellulose. Atmospheric SO 2 emitted from natural/anthropogenic sources can be oxidized to SO 4 2− on particle surfaces during atmospheric processing. Both levoglucosan and H 2 SO 4 form aqueous solutions even at a few percent relative humidity. Regarding ice nucleation behaviors of kaolinite particles coated with aqueous solutions, our expectation was that deposition ice nucleation would be shut off in the regime below water saturation, but only H 2 SO 4 could additionally react with kaolinite particles to potentially influence freezing of soluble coatings and activated cloud droplets. The levoglucosan and H 2 SO 4 coatings used here serve as surrogates for non-reactive and reactive coatings that have impacts on initial ice nucleation involving mineral dust particles in the atmosphere. We do not consider additional physical and chemical impacts on ice nucleation that may exist during actual cloud processing.. Kaolinite particles Fluka were generated in a fluidized bed generator and then passed through a self-built corona discharger and a 85 Kr neutralizer. Subsequently, the particles passed through a heated vapor diffusion tube containing a reservoir of levoglucosan or H 2 SO 4 . The tube was surrounded by a thermostatically-controlled water jacket. The amounts of soluble materials deposited on the particle surfaces were controlled by the temperature of the water jacket. In this study, we set the temperature to 93°C for levoglucosan and to 70°C for H 2 SO 4 . According to soluble mass estimates based on the measured aerosol hygroscopicity data not reported here and previously described methods, it is expected that most of individual kaolinite particles after passing through the tube took up an amount of levoglucosan or H 2 SO 4 enough to form several monolayers on the particle surfaces H. Wex et al., manuscript in preparation, 2012 . Note that these estimates are based on the assumption that the particles are spherical and that the soluble materials are deposited on the particle surfaces uniformly. Water uptake is certain to aid coating by aqueous solutions during the freezing experiments. Particles with an electrostatic mobility diameter of 300 nm or 700 nm were selected in a differential mobility analyzer for the use of various experiments.. The CFDC uses a temperature gradient to produce well-defined ice-supersaturated conditions in a focused by sheath flow and flowing aerosol lamina between two ice-covered walls. The CFDC has a particle nucleation/growth section, followed by a droplet evaporation section where only ice saturation exists the wall temperature gradient is almost zero . Since cloud droplets cannot survive through the evaporation section unless the relative humidity with respect to liquid water RH w in the particle nucleation/growth section exceeds ∼108%, only particles that nucleate ice and grow to super-micron sizes are counted as IN with an optical particle counter at the outlet. In this study, the IN number concentrations at temperatures of −34°C, −30°C and −26°C were determined as a function of RH w by scanning the selected experimental conditions from ice saturation to about 107%RH w . Simultaneously, the total particle number concentrations were also measured using a condensation particle counter to determine the fraction of particles serving as IN i.e., IN fraction = the ratio of the IN number concentrations to the total particle number concentrations . Typical background IN counts were <1.0 L −1 . Given typical total particle number concentrations of 10–100 cm −3 , the background IN counts lead to IN fractions of <10 −4 –10 −5 . In this study, we regard the IN fraction of 10 −4 as the quantification limit of our experiments..Fraction of 300 nm kaolinite particles that nucleated ice at −34°C, −30°C and −26°C as a function of RH w . a Untreated kaolinite particles, b kaolinite particles treated with levoglucosan at 93°C, and c kaolinite particles treated with H 2 SO 4 at 70°C. Dashed lines indicate liquid water saturated conditions. Error bars indicate standard deviations. The results for 300 nm kaolinite particles treated with H 2 SO 4 are shown in Figure 1c . After the treatment with H 2 SO 4 , ice nucleation was hardly detected below water saturation, similar to the results after the treatment with levoglucosan Figure 1b . However, Figure 1c shows that the IN fractions of the particles treated with H 2 SO 4 were lowered even above water saturation, particularly at temperatures warmer than −34°C. For example, after the treatment with H 2 SO 4 , the IN fractions of kaolinite particles above water saturation at 104%RH w at −34°C decreased from about 0.14 to 0.079 at 104%RH w , while those at −26°C dropped from about 3.5 × 10 −3 to below quantification limit see also Figure 1a and Table S1 . These results suggest that the H 2 SO 4 coatings caused a large loss of the ice nucleating ability of kaolinite particles in the immersion/condensation freezing regime, especially at warmer temperatures.. We investigated the changes in the IN fractions of 700 nm kaolinite particles before and after the treatment with levoglucosan and H 2 SO 4 . The results indicate that both the levoglucosan and H 2 SO 4 coatings reduced the ice nucleating ability of 700 nm kaolinite particles below water saturation, but only the H 2 SO 4 coatings efficiently altered their ice nucleating ability above water saturation, particularly at temperatures warmer than −34°C see Figure 2 . This tendency corresponds to that found for the 300 nm particles, but the IN fractions of the 700 nm particles tended to be higher than those of the 300 nm particles even after the treatment with levoglucosan or H 2 SO 4 see also Figure 1 and Table S1 .Same as Figure 1 , but for 700 nm kaolinite particles.. A more detailed discussion concerning the impacts of the hygroscopic behaviors and thicknesses of soluble coatings on ice nucleation will be performed in an accompanying paper H. Wex et al., manuscript in preparation, 2012 . In the immersion/condensation freezing regime of very dilute solutes above water saturation , only the H 2 SO 4 coatings reduced the ice nucleating ability of kaolinite particles, while the levoglucosan coatings had little or no impact on the ice nucleating ability of the particles. The reduction of the ice nucleating ability in the immersion/condensation freezing regime induced by the uptake of H 2 SO 4 tended to be stronger for the experiments at temperatures warmer than −34°C.: During this reaction, the fraction of SiO 2 in the parent kaolinite clay increases since Al 2 SO 4 3 can easily be dissolved in water. We speculate that the morphology and composition of kaolinite particle surfaces can be modified as a result of chemical reactions with H 2 SO 4 , as for reaction 1 . One of the reasons why kaolinite particles are good IN is thought to be related to the structure of water adsorbed on kaolinite surfaces with trench-like defects. Destruction of ordered water structures at the water/mineral interfaces caused by high concentrations of H 2 SO 4 may also act to reduce the ice nucleating ability of kaolinite particles, although this mechanism is assumed to be activated mainly in the ice nucleation regime below water saturation. Further work will be necessary to understand how chemical reactions affect the ice nucleation properties of mineral dust particles in the immersion/condensation freezing regime at different temperatures.. For example, although both HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 can react with alkaline carbonates e.g., CaCO 3 , the products of the reactions may have different solubilities e.g., Ca NO 3 2 and CaSO 4 are highly and slightly soluble salts, respectively . Therefore, such reaction products may cause the observed difference in the ice nucleation properties of ATD particles above water saturation. However, it should be noted here that carbonates are likely to be a minor component and hence distributed between individual ATD particles heterogeneously. Also, given that HNO 3 cannot effectively react with aluminosilicates that are a major component of ATD, only a small impact of the reactions with HNO 3 on the ice nucleation properties of ATD particles in the immersion/condensation freezing regime may be expected. On the other hand, the uptake of H 2 SO 4 can effectively reduce the ice nucleating ability of ATD particles in the immersion/condensation freezing regime, particularly at temperatures warmer than −35°C. In this regard, the present experiments with kaolinite particles support the idea that the reduction of the ice nucleating ability of ATD particles in this regime is mainly due to the reactions between aluminosilicates and H 2 SO 4 , such as reaction 1 .. Considering that desert dust storms are occasionally mixed with biomass burning smokes during their long-range transport, the mixing of levoglucosan and/or other non-reactive soluble organics with mineral dust particles is assumed to occur in mixed dust/smoke plumes. Our results suggest that the ice nucleating ability of mineral dust particles i.e., the number concentrations of mineral dust IN can be maintained under mixed-phase cloud conditions even if they are coated with such non-reactive compounds. On the other hand, the mixing processes of desert dust storms with natural and anthropogenic emissions containing reactive compounds e.g., H 2 SO 4 or its precursors may play an important role in reducing the number concentrations of mineral dust IN under mixed-phase cloud conditions. Further work will be needed to incorporate such considerations into atmospheric models and to validate such effects occurring in the atmosphere."
65,dust aerosol,"Record heavy mineral dust outbreaks over Korea in 2010: Two cases observed with multiwavelength aerosol/depolarization/Raman-quartz lidar. We report on two strong events of transport of mineral dust from Central Asia across Korea. The events took place in March and November 2010. The November case is important as fall is not a typical time for strong dust outbreaks in East Asia. We observed the dust with a multiwavelength aerosol/depolarization/Raman quartz lidar. The record PM-10 concentration of nearly 1600 mu g/m 3 in March 2010 exceeds the record value of 1470 mu g/m 3 measured in Seoul in March 2002. The event in November was the strongest case of dust transport ever observed over Korea in fall. We find up to 360 mu g/m 3 dust in heights above 250 m which is significantly different from the ground-based PM-10 observations. Citation: Tatarov, B., D. Muller, Y.-M. Noh, K.-H. Lee, D.-H.

When the dust plumes reach the continental rim the maximum particle concentrations usually do not exceed 500 report on the mixing of dust with anthropogenic pollutants during transport across China. The observations were performed at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology GIST 35.2°N, 126.8°E , South Korea. The lidar is described by and . We obtained the molecular optical profiles on the basis of routine radiosonde observations carried out at the Gwangju airport which is located approximately 13 km away from GIST. The PM-10 data are taken from the web site of KMA http://web.kma.go.kr/eng/weather/asiandust/timeseries.jsp . We computed backward trajectories with the HYSPLIT model Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory http://www.arl.noaa.gov/HYSPLIT_info.php . We used satellite images from OMI Ozone Monitoring Instrument for identifying dust over East Asia during the time period reported in this contribution. during one day of the Saharan Mineral Dust Experiment SAMUM which took place in Morocco in May/June 2006. Aside from this large value, PM-10 concentrations were at maximum 1000   Figures 2a–2g show dust optical properties. The depicted time period is the time of highest backscatter signals and nearly highest PM-10 concentration. The lidar return signals in all channels were nearly fully attenuated above 3 km altitude because of the high dust load. This attenuation makes it impossible to calibrate the lidar profiles at altitudes near the tropopause region. The calibration was performed using the nearest in time available data in a clear particle-free portion of the atmosphere and without changing the system parameters. a–f Dust optical properties measured from 11:15 to 13:15 UTC on 20 March 2010 and g–l measured from 16:15 to 18:15 UTC on 11 November 2010. We show the particle backscatter coefficient Figures 2a and 2g , the particle extinction coefficient Figures 2b and 2h , and the lidar ratio at 532 nm green and 355 nm blue , respectively Figures 2c and 2i . We show the linear volume depolarization ratio at 532 nm black and the particle depolarization ratio green Figures 2d and 2j , the extinction-related black and the backscatter-related Ångström exponent green at 355/532 nm Figures 2e and 2k and the mineral quartz concentration at 546 nm green and 360 nm blue Figures 2f and 2l . Error bars denote one-standard deviation statistical noise..  Published literature shows varying lidar ratios for mineral dust plumes over East Asia. The variation may be due to the fact that mineral dust very often occurs in mixtures with urban haze external mixtures and/or coating of dust , the distance to the source regions, and different chemical and physical properties of the dust source regions. We find values of 49 ± 9 sr 355 and 43 ± 7 sr 532 nm as possible lower limit. The upper limit seems to be around 56 ± 10 sr 355 nm and 51 ± 6 sr. The data are from observations in the free troposphere, which likely describe mineral dust that is the least contaminated with urban aerosols. For comparison, lidar observations of pure Saharan dust show lidar ratios of around 50–55 sr at 355 and 532 nm. Mineral dust does not contain 100% silicon dioxide which serves as tracer of the Raman quartz lidar signals. Literature on the chemical composition of East Asian dust observed in Uzbekistan, China and Mongolia, and East Siberia shows that silicon dioxide makes up for 59–77% of the composition of dust grains. If we use these numbers we obtain approximately 250 μ g/m 3 dust, which is considerably lower than the dust concentration inferred from the PM-10 measurements. Note that a direct comparison of lidar and ground-based in-situ measurements is impossible, as we do not measure PM-10 with lidar. The particle backscatter coefficients were nearly constant with height. The extinction coefficients slightly decreased with height. The volume and the particle depolarization ratios slightly decreased from 25% at 0.4 km to approximately 20% at 2 km height. The column mean values of the Ångström exponents were 0.1 for the backscatter-related and 0.4 for the extinction-related Ångström exponent, which are higher values compared to the numbers we obtained for 20 March 2010. We presented two case studies 20 March and 11 November 2010 of unusually strong Asian dust events observed with a multiwavelength Raman lidar in South Korea. Ground-based PM-10 measurements carried out by the Korea Meteorological Administration showed values of more than 1000 μ g/m 3 . Since 2004 only 6 more events were recorded that exceed this threshold value. The optical depth of the particle plume observed in March 2010 was so strong that the lidar return signals were totally attenuated above the height of 2.5 km above surface. We estimated the optical depth of the plume to a minimum value of 3.5 at 532 nm. The case study of November reports for the first time a dust event which exceeds a PM-10 value of 1000 μ g/m 3 at ground level over Korea. The maximum mineral dust concentrations above 250 m height above ground are 250 μ g/m 3 on 20 March 2010 and 360 μ g/m 3 on 11 November 2010. This altitude is the minimum overlap height of our lidar. These value are significantly lower than the ground-based, average PM-10 values reported for the lidar measurement times. Differences in particle extinction coefficients, lidar ratios, and quartz-backscatter coefficients could be caused by a varying chemical composition of the mineral dust plumes observed on the two days. The air mass backward trajectories point at different source regions. A more detailed interpretation of the data has to be left for investigations with, e.g., dust transport models or data from observatories that monitored dust in Central China and Mongolia. Another reason for the different optical properties of the dust could be the mixing of dust with urban haze over China, as this is nearly always the case in East Asia."
69,aerosol climate clouds,"Effect of spectral-dependent surface albedo on Saharan dust direct radiative forcing. Direct radiative forcing DRF due to mineral dust has quite large uncertainty. Surface albedo is one of the most important factors affecting dust radiative forcing and climate. Here we investigate the effect of spectral-dependent surface albedo on dust DRF over the Saharan desert region using MODIS surface albedo data and a size-resolved global aerosol model. In one simulation, surface albedo in 7 wavebands from MODIS-retrieved data is interpolated to the corresponding 4 solar wavebands of the radiation transfer model case 1 . In another simulation, surface albedo for visible wavebands is applied to all 4 solar spectral-bands case 2 , which was previously used by many global model simulations. Our results show that the annual averaged DRF for all sky over the Saharan dust is -2.4 W m -2 and -5.6 W m -2 at TOA, and -9.9 W m -2 and -12.9 W m -2 at surface for cases 1 and 2, respectively. Such a large difference highlights the importance of using accurate spectral-dependent surface albedo, and implies that previous studies employing only visible-band surface albedo might have significantly overestimated the dust cooling effect over the Saharan dust.

Due to the complexity in factors such as dust emission, size distribution, optical properties and surface conditions, the direct radiative forcing DRF of mineral dust and its climate effect remains to have large uncertainties and great efforts have been made in the past to improve the representation of mineral dust in the model..

The model has been extended by including a look-up table Mie code, to calculate aerosol optical properties, and a radiation transfer model to estimate radiation fluxes.. The APM model, incorporated into GEOS-Chem by  The 1D radiation transfer model of the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis CCCma has been adapted and incorporated into the GEOS-Chem-APM, to calculate shortwave fluxes over four solar bands 0.20–0.69, 0.69–1.19, 1.19–2.38, 2.38–4.00 μ m and longwave fluxes over 9 infrared spectral intervals 4.0–4.5, 4.5–5.5, 5.5–6.5, 6.5–9.0, 9.0–10.0, 10.0–12.5, 12.5–18.5, 18.5–27.9, 27.9–40.0 μ m . The model includes molecular Rayleigh scattering, gas absorption, cloud effects, and aerosol scattering and absorption. This radiation model is a correlated k-distribution scheme for gaseous transmission. For shortwave radiation, water vapor, CO 2 , O 3 , CH 4 and O 2 are considered for gaseous transmission. For longwave radiation, water vapor, CO 2 , O 3 , CH 4 , N 2 O, CFC 11 and CFC 12 are considered for gaseous transmission. In the present study, the atmospheric vertical profiles of pressure, temperature and water vapor mixing ratios are provided by GEOS-Chem meteorological fields. O 3 concentration is taken from GEOS-Chem simulation. The solar zenith angle, cloud cover and cloud water content both liquid and ice are also taken from GEOS-Chem. The cloud optical properties: specific extinction, single scattering albedo and asymmetry parameter, are parameterized for each band as a function of cloud size and concentration. The effective radius for liquid cloud and ice cloud are taken from CERES satellite data. With the cloud water contents and effective particle sizes, the cloud optical properties for each band are computed for liquid cloud particles at solar and infrared wavebands and for ice cloud particles at solar and infrared wavebands.. These studies show that the MODIS albedo data are reasonably accurate, with typically less than 5% absolute error. Figure 1 shows the area-averaged surface albedo over Saharan regions 10°–25° N, 10° W–30° E at 7 wavebands from MODIS datasets. It is clearly shown that surface albedo is strongly dependent on waveband, with the lower surface albedo at visible bands bands 1, 3 and 4 and higher at near-infrared bands. The spatial distribution of surface albedo at band 3, band 5, and the ratio of band 3 to band 5 are presented in Figure 2 . It is seen that surface albedo at band 3 is generally lower than 0.3, while at band 5 it is higher than 0.5, so the ratio is around 0.2 to 0.3. This indicates that using visible surface albedo, which is commonly applied in many previous studies, may not be appropriate and may cause the bias in predicted radiative forcing and climate. The surface albedo in the different seasons January, April, July and October is also shown in Figure 1 . No significant seasonal variability in the region is found since dust covers the surface in the whole year. In this study, the surface albedo in the MODIS bands 1–7 have been interpolated to the 4 bands corresponding to those used in the radiation transfer model and updated every 8 day.MODIS-retrieved surface albedo over the Saharan dust region at 7 wavebands in 2006.MODIS-retrieved annual mean surface albedo over the Saharan dust region at a band 3, b band 5, and c the ratio of band 3 to band 5. data used here is the monthly level-3 product with a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°. Annual averaged AOD at 555 nm green band for the year 2006 is applied for comparison with the model simulation. MODIS Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AOD data is taken from the monthly level-3 product from Aqua MYD08_M3.051 with 1° × 1° degree resolution, and combined with the deep blue product, which is a separate product specifically retrieved for the AOD over desert regions. The annual averaged AOD at 550 nm is used for comparison. It should be noted that the AOD values from satellite retrievals are the total extinction caused by all types of aerosol particles, but the model simulated AOD shown in the Figure 3b is just for dust particles. However, the dominant aerosol particles in the region are from dust. Overall, the spatial distribution and seasonal change of the simulated AOD are quite consistent with the satellite retrievals. a GEOS-Chem-APM simulated dust burden in mg m −2 , b dust optical depth AOD at 550 nm, c AOD from MISR at 555 nm, and d AOD from MODIS at 550 nm in January and July. AOD values from satellite retrievals are the total extinction caused by all types of aerosol particles, while the modeled AOD shown in Figure 3b is just for dust particles.  Figure 4b shows the clear sky DRF at surface for the case 1 top plot , case 2 middle plot , and their difference bottom plot . These results present that the net shortwave SW radiation at surface due to dust particles is less negative in case 1 than in case 2. This is because the more incoming solar radiation is reflected by the higher surface albedo see Figure 1 , and thus less incoming radiation available for dust particles. Therefore the reflected radiation by dust particles decrease and DRF at surface becomes smaller. The magnitude and spatial distribution of difference in DRF at TOA Figure 4a , bottom is almost the same as that of the difference in DRF at surface for clear-sky Figure 4b , bottom , indicating that the DRF at TOA is mostly determined by the reflected radiation at surface, which is controlled by surface albedo.. We can see from Figure 4c that the annual averaged atmospheric absorption due to dust is generally higher than 2 W m −2 , and up to 8 W m −2 in the majority of the region. The atmospheric absorption in the case 1 top plot is a bit higher than in the case 2 middle plot since high-albedo surfaces lead to enhanced absorption of reflected radiation, so the difference bottom plot is slightly positive. The annual averaged vertical profiles of relative solar heating rates due to dust also show figure omitted that the solar heating rate with the spectral-dependent surface albedo is slightly higher than that with the visible-wavelength surface albedo. shows that desert surface albedo is dependent on solar zenith angle. We used a simple one-parameter formulation to consider the dependence of albedo on solar zenith angle, and the difference of all-sky DRF at TOA between the test simulation and the original one is within 10%. In this study, two sets of surface albedo data are used in the GEOS-Chem-APM model, to examine the DRF due to dust particles, particularly the effect of surface albedo on DRF overt the Saharan desert. One simulation uses a spectral-dependent surface albedo, while the other uses the visible-band surface albedo, which has also been used in most previous studies. Our study shows that the surface albedo plays a significant role in modulating DRF over the Sarahan dust. If only the visible-band surface albedo is taken into account, the DRF at TOA is always negative. However, a spectral-dependent surface albedo used in the study gives less negative DRF values, or even positive in part of the region. This is because the surface reflects more incoming solar radiation due to the high surface albedo for the spectral-dependent case, so the dust particles scatter less. It can be concluded that previous studies which used a visible-band surface albedo overestimated the reflected solar radiation and DRF at TOA over the Saharan region. To predict the dust DRF more accurately, it is necessary to take a spectral-dependent surface albedo into account."
66,dust climate aerosol,"Dust transport from non-East Asian sources to the North Pacific. It is generally thought that East Asia dominates the supply of eolian dust to the North Pacific. Here we show the first data-based evidence of dust primarily from non-East Asian sources even during March 2010 when a super dust storm from East Asia struck the western Pacific. Chemical characteristics of aerosol samples collected at a high-mountain site in Taiwan show variable inputs from eolian dust and biomass burning. From backward trajectory analyses, satellite observation and model simulation, dust origins can be traced to the Middle East and North Africa, suggesting an integrated source from the global dust belt. Our global model results demonstrate that dust deposition in the North Pacific is primarily contributed by non-East Asian sources with an eastward decrease along the Westerlies. Citation: Hsu, S.-C., et al. 2012 , Dust transport from non-East Asian sources to the North Pacific, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L12804, doi:10.1029/2012GL051962. .. However, East Asia contributes a relatively small portion ∼4% of the global dust emission ∼2500 Tg/year . Therefore, it is debatable whether East Asia alone can constitute a sufficient source for dust deposition in the North Pacific as has been generally thought. Model simulations often suggested a substantial provenance from North Africa and Central Asia, accounting for larger than half of the total dust deposition over the North Pacific, although most models still cannot accurately catch the spatial pattern in the tropical North Pacific.  The HYSPLIT trajectory model driven by the NCEP GDAS was used to trace the origins of air masses. The WRF/Chem Ver.3.1 tracer model was employed to simulate long-range transport of episodic dust originated from areas recorded in the SYNOP surface synoptic observations reports. The tracer concentration was assigned to 50,000 units per day at each reported dusty location during 3–5 March 2010 Figure S2 . The meteorological initial and boundary conditions were obtained at 6-hour intervals and run for ten days from 00 UTC 3–13 March, 2010. Source apportionment studies, where only one source is activated, were conducted using the Model of Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry MATCH forced by NCEP/NCAR winds with the Dust Entrainment and Deposition Module. Horizontal resolution is 2.2° in latitude and longitude T62 , with 28 vertical levels. This modeling framework has been compared to observations. Each source area is allowed to be active alone for 7 source areas North Africa, Middle East/Central Asia, East Asia, Australia, North America, South America, South Africa ; this simulation is conducted for 15 months, with the first three months used for spinup of the aerosols. The CALIPSO Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations satellite with Orthogonal Polarization CALIOP has horizontal resolution of 333 m along the track and longitudinal spacing of 2000–2500 km along the orbit track at mid latitudes http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/PRODOCS/calipso/table_calipso.html . Level 1B CALIOP data provide profiles of the volume depolarization ratio DPR at 532 nm, which is employed to identify non-spherical dust particles in the present study. and it correlates highly with EC R = 0.97 and OC R = 0.93 , this parameter is a definite indicator of biomass burning. On the other hand, Al is tightly coupled to Ca R = 0.97 and they have been widely accepted as indicators of mineral dust aerosols. We suggest the observed time series can be explained by variable contribution of aerosols from mineral dust and biomass burning. We shall deal only with the transport of dust component below.Time-series of aerosol composition at Mt. Lulin: a 210 Pb and biomass burning potassium K BB , b 7 Be and aluminum. Also shown in Figure 1a are daily mean O 3 and CO, hourly relative humidity gray curve/area and in Figure 1b daily rainfall yellow bars . The likely sources and transport pathways of various aerosols were analyzed using seven-day air-mass backward trajectories derived from the HYSPLIT model of NOAA driven by the NCEP GDAS. The modeled trajectories at 3 km Figure S4 , top and 6 km a.s.l. Figure S4 , bottom during the sampling period can be divided into three groups; those responsible for the seven high-Al samples are shown in Figure 2a . Also indicated are dusty sites Figure 2a recorded by SYNOP report during March 1–25, 2010. Obviously, trajectories of Al-enriched air masses can be traced to the Middle East and even farther to North Africa. a Seven-day air-mass backward trajectories at 3 and 6 km a.s.l. for seven high dust days during our sampling period. Starting dates are indicated at the beginning of each trajectory. Sites with surface dusty phenomena based on daily SYNOP weather reports during March 1–25, 2010 are indicated by circles. Circles in different colors represent siting in different 5-day intervals. b A still image of the simulated distribution of tracer concentration at 650 hPa at 06:00 UTC 11 March 2010. Taiwan is marked by a dashed circle.. The temporal pattern of Al and its covariation with 7 Be Figure 1b strongly suggest that the transport of eolian particles is likely associated with the stratospheric and upper tropospheric folding and subsidence in the springtime. When the time series of 7 Be and Al is compared with that of relative humidity Figure 1b , it reveals the association of higher 7 Be and Al with the upper dry air mass, and that of lower 7 Be and Al with the lower wet air mass, especially during intense rainfall. Indeed, backward trajectory analysis reveals the invasion and upward transport of moist and dust-free maritime air mass from the south, arriving Mt. Lulin on the low- 7 Be and low-Al days.. This explains why the super dust event sourced from north China was recorded at lower altitudes around Taiwan but not at the high-mountain site in central Taiwan. Therefore, we argue the dust signals observed in this study primarily came from remote areas other than the Asian continent. This is the first data-based report of such a pathway for dust delivered to the East Asia region.. To further demonstrate the transport of the dust-loaded air, the WRF/Chem tracer model was employed to simulate air transport during selected dusty days. The model was run based on the timing and places of dust emission determined by the satellite observations and driven by the WMO prescribed atmospheric and meteorological conditions Figures S2 and S5 . Figure 2b shows that, on March 11, 2010, dense dust plumes at 650 hPa extended from the North Africa and the Middle East across much of the Asia Continent to Eastern China and our sampling site Taiwan , which is very consistent with the NAAPS global aerosol modeling results of US Navy http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/aerosol_web/ . As revealed by the analysis of a yearlong CALIPSO lidar data, the dust was often uplifted to an elevation of ∼6 km or higher over the source regions, facilitating the transport across the Tibetan Plateau, followed by eastward transport in the prevailing westerlies toward our sampling site. This explanation agrees well with the fact that the heights over the dust sources traced by the modeled trajectories were often up to 5 km or even higher Figure 2a . To further validate our model simulation, we also ran the forward trajectory using the HYSPLIT model Figure S6 and assuming the dust source was located somewhere in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where dust events had been recorded. The results were consistent with our tracer model simulation. Recently, Saharan dust is suggested to be another possible dust source to the Greenland besides Asian dust. Here we present a more modern record to substantiate the notion that transport of dust around the globe can be more effective and extensive than traditionally thought. This is also supported by our recent investigation on the transport of Fukushima radiation clouds across the Northern Hemisphere., collected by the CALIPSO satellite during March 4–14, 2010. From a series of 2D sections of DPR Figure 3 , it can be seen that North Africa was covered by heavy dust columns ∼5 km in height on March 4. Entrained in the westerlies, the core of the dust plume moved to the Arabian Peninsula on March 5, and further on to the Thar Desert on the Indian Subcontinent on March 6, likely with an uncertain addition of local dust. This observation corroborates the model simulation described above and once again demonstrates the global dust belt as an integrated source for the dust transported to the North Pacific. When the dust reached eastern China on March 10 and the northwestern Pacific, its lidar signal was significantly reduced by dense cloud cover. However, dust can still be identified thereafter, even in the open North Pacific 180°E , suggesting that the area in the northwestern Pacific influenced by dust aerosols may very well be more extensive than that identified by CALIPSO lidar.Two-dimensional sections of DPR collected by CALIPSO lidar during March 4–14, 2010. Clouds are screened out and shown as blank area. Dust plumes in the last three sections are marked in red ovals.. All the major dust sources around the globe are considered in the simulation, including North Africa, Arabian Peninsula, East Asia, and miscellaneous sources. From the annual mean Al concentration of 255 ng/m 3 measured at Mt. Lulin in 2010 Figure S7 and assuming Al content in the mineral dust is 8%, the dust concentration is 3.2. The evidence presented here suggests that dust sourced from the North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia must be taken into account along with the East Asian source to better understand dust deposition in the North Pacific. While observed dust fluxes were normally higher in the western part than the eastern part of the equatorial Pacific, models often yielded an inconsistent flux gradient. The largely ignored distant source can probably explain the underestimation and inconsistency of east-west dust deposition gradient of the modeled dust fluxes in the equatorial Pacific. Without taking this additional input into account, neither the paleoclimate retrieved from the North Pacific pelagic sediments nor the transport and deposition of dust to the North Pacific can be reliably determined.Results from the MATCH model showing a total annual dust deposition fluxes, and b fraction of the total deposition attributable to East Asian sources over the North Pacific.[14]  The impact of long-range transport of aerosols is so profound that regional models may have difficulty fully studying aerosol-climate interactions if the sources and pathways of aerosols are not well characterized. This study points to the need of a long-term observation of the upper tropospheric aerosols at key locations in the subtropical Asian areas, such as Mt. Lulin, Taiwan, and the northern regions such as Japan and Korea, to the North Pacific."
59,dust,"Assessment of error in aerosol optical depth measured by AERONET due to aerosol forward scattering. We present an analysis of the effect of aerosol forward scattering on the accuracy of aerosol optical depth AOD measured by CIMEL Sun photometers. The effect is quantified in terms of AOD and solar zenith angle using radiative transfer modeling. The analysis is based on aerosol size distributions derived from multi-year climatologies of AERONET aerosol retrievals. The study shows that the modeled error is lower than AOD calibration uncertainty 0.01 for the vast majority of AERONET level 2 observations, similar to 99.53%. Only similar to 0.47% of the AERONET database corresponding mostly to dust aerosol with high AOD and low solar elevations has larger biases. We also show that observations with extreme reductions in direct solar irradiance do not contribute to level 2 AOD due to low Sun photometer digital counts below a quality control cutoff threshold.

The Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET provides the largest AOD dataset resulting from multi-year observations at more than 500 locations all over the world. The observations of transmitted solar radiation at 340, 380, 440, 500, 675, 870, 940 and 1020 nm nominal wavelengths; extended wavelength versions additionally have 1640 nm are performed by CIMEL Sun photometers which have field-of-view FOV of 1.2°. also estimated the relative AOD error due to aerosol forward scattering to be ∼0.7% for coarse mode only dust aerosol with effective radius 1.75need to be multiplied by cosine of SZA before calculating the relative error for AOD - see Section 2 for details. Much larger uncertainties are reported for 80° SZA. The errors estimated in  The effect of aerosol forward scattering for 1.2° FOV was the subject of several research studies. However no estimations were reported for very large AOD and SZA. For example, the approach used in can create a misconception about the accuracy of AOD measured by AERONET; therefore a realistic assessment of the forward scattering effect for the AERONET data base is important. In this paper we present results of aerosol forward scattering effect modeling for wide ranges of both AOD and SZA using both Junge distributions as well as realistic ASDs based on AERONET aerosol retrievals. We also assess how cases with large AOD and low solar elevations are represented in the variability of AOD observed by AERONET. Our analysis is primarily focused on coarse mode dust aerosols which exhibit a strong forward scattering pattern. A less detailed consideration for fine mode aerosols is also presented.. Radiative transfer calculations were performed using the code of , the Angstrom exponent calculated directly from computed spectral AOD is different from 0.2 and equals ∼0.3.. Therefore, ASDs based on multi-year 2000–2011 climatologies of AERONET aerosol retrievals for selected dust dominated sites were used in modeling of the FOV effect along with the Junge ASD. The climatologies were developed for observations with 440 nm AOD ranging from 0.5 to 0.6..Aerosol size distributions used in FOV error analysis: the Junge ASD with computed Angstrom exponent of 0.3 and ASDs based on aerosol retrievals for three AERONET sites dominated by dust. All ASD's are normalized to have the same AOD at 440 nm. exhibit the largest AOD uncertainties.Errors in 440 nm AOD due to diffuse radiation scattered into the Cimel instrument FOV modeled for dust aerosols for four SZAs: a 40°, b 60°, c 70°, and d 75°. The low count threshold of 10 counts indicated at 70° and 75° was not reached for the 40° and 60° SZA simulations. In general much smaller contributions to aerosol forward scattering effects from fine mode aerosols is expected. Figure 4 shows results of simulations for 440 nm obtained using ASD based on AERONET aerosol retrievals for the GSFC site 1997–2009; 440 nm AOD ∼0.5 and refractive index of 1.4-0.005i. As can be seen, Δ τ estimates at 440 nm are smaller than ∼0.01 for the majority of solar elevations considered reaching the maximum value of ∼0.025 for 60° SZA and AOD of 3.5. For longer wavelengths not shown the errors are always lower than 0.01.Same as in Figure 3 for 440 nm only, but for fine mode aerosols, utilizing the AERONET GSFC site ASD. For longer wavelengths not shown the errors are always lower than 0.01.. The percentage of AOD measurements in the Level 2 data with FOV bias greater than 0.01 was estimated to be ∼0.47% 0.46% for dust; 0.01% for fine mode aerosols , meaning that the great majority of AERONET AOD retrievals have FOV error smaller than 0.01.[16]  In this paper the error in AOD, estimated from 1.2° FOV Sun photometer observations, due to the aerosol forward scattering effect has been evaluated. Analysis was performed using radiative transfer modeling employing both a Junge ASD and ASDs based on AERONET aerosol retrievals. Using the Junge ASD in radiative transfer modeling resulted in considerable overestimates of modeled AOD error as compared to more realistic AERONET based ASDs which were used in subsequent analysis. The analysis found that 99.53% of the AERONET AOD data have 440 nm bias errors due to FOV effects much lower than the AERONET AOD estimated uncertainty of 0.01. Only ∼0.47% of the AERONET Level 1.5 and Level 2 data corresponding mostly to dust aerosol with high AOD and low solar elevations have AOD error larger than 0.01. We also showed that observations with extreme reductions in direct solar irradiance and potentially large AOD errors do not contribute to Level 1.5 and Level 2 AOD due to low Sun photometer digital counts that are below the AERONET threshold. Potentially AOD retrievals with FOV error larger than 0.01 and the signal level above the digital counts threshold can be flagged as diffuse light contaminated. These AOD retrievals could be corrected using radiative transfer modeling for a set of representative ASDs."
57,impact aerosol,"Size-resolved adjoint inversion of Asian dust. We expanded the variational assimilation system of a regional dust model by using size-resolved inversion. Dust emissions and particle-size distributions of a severe dust and sandstorm DSS in April 2005 were inversely optimized with optical measurements by the National Institute for Environmental Studies lidar network. The inversion results successfully compensated underestimates by the original model and increased the Angstrom exponent around the DSS core by 13-17%, shifting the particle-size distribution to finer. The a posteriori size distribution was distinctly different between eastern and western source regions. In the western regions, dust emissions in the 3.19 and 5.06 mu m size bins increased considerably, and the peak size shifted from 5.06 to 3.19 mu m, whereas in the eastern regions, emissions of finer particles bins 0.82-2.01 mu m increased. Differences in vegetation and soil type and moisture between eastern and western regions might explain the characteristics of the inverted size distribution. Citation: Yumimoto, K., I. Uno, N. Sugimoto, A. Shimizu, Y. Hara, and T. Takemura 2012 , Size-resolved adjoint inversion of Asian dust, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L24807, doi: 10.1029/2012GL053890. . Recently, novel satellite measurements, widely distributed observation networks, intensive field campaigns, and several numerical modeling studies have enhanced our understanding of the dust life cycle i.e., its emission, transport, and deposition . However, significant uncertainties and many challenges remain.. Particle-size distribution is one of the most important and also one of the most uncertain factors, because it affects the emission, lifetime, optical properties, and deposition of dust.  We used the RAMS/CFORS-4DVAR RC4 model and data assimilation system. RC4 consists of a forward dust transport model RAMS/CFORS , its adjoint model, and an optimization process. Size-resolved inversion was applied to the severe DSS of 26–28 April 2005. The basic set-up of the experiment was the same as that used by Y2007 . The simulation domain was centered at 37.5°N, 115.0°E on a rotated polar stereographic system, and covered all of China, Mongolia, and Japan. The model domain comprised 180 × 100 horizontal and 40 vertical grid cells with a horizontal resolution of 40 km. RC4 has 12 dust particle size bins whose effective radii , and we also examined environmental parameters topography, vegetation, and soil properties in the dust source regions. We summarize our results as follows. 2. In the Y2007 result, the Ångström exponent was little modified compared with a priori result, whereas in the a posteriori result the Ångström exponent increased by 0.15–0.25 13–17% around the DSS core, indicating that the size-resolved inversion produced a finer particle-size distribution.[24]  3. A posteriori dust emission fluxes showed distinct differences in particle-size distribution between eastern and western source regions. In western regions, the inversion considerably increased emissions of the 3.19 and 5.06 μ m fractions, and the peak emission shifted from the 5.06 to the 3.19 μ m fraction. In the eastern region, the 0.82–2.01 μ m fractions were considerably increased, and the overall size distribution was finer. In the easternmost region, in particular, the dust emission flux of the 5.06 μ m fraction decreased considerably, and the distribution was flattened. Dust emissions in mountainous regions were decreased in the inversion result.[25]  4. There were distinct differences in soil group and NDVI between the western and eastern regions. The dominant soils in the western and eastern regions were classified in Calcisols and Gypsisols, respectively. NDVI tended to decrease from northeast to southwest, and denser vegetation was indicated in the eastern regions. These differences might explain the differences in the size distribution in the a posteriori dust emission. Moreover, the soil moisture content was the lowest in the easternmost region 10% drier than soils in region III , which might account for the flattened size distribution there.[26]  Despite limited observational constraints, the inversion results were promising, demonstrating the feasibility of the method. To make the inversion system more robust, in a future study additional observational constraints should be applied e.g., multispectral observational constraints and the results should be validated by various observations in both downwind and source regions."
58,dust aerosol,"Soil-derived sulfate in atmospheric dust particles at Taklimakan desert. Dust-associated sulfate is believed to be a key species which can alter the physical and chemical properties of dust particles in the atmosphere. Its occurrence in the particles has usually been considered to be the consequence of particles' aging in the air although it is present in some crustal minerals. Our observation at the north and south edge of Taklimakan desert, one of the largest dust sources in the Northern Hemisphere, during a dust episode in April 2008 revealed that sulfate in atmospheric dust samples most likely originated directly from surface soil. Its TSP, PM10 and PM2.5 content was proportional to samples' mass and comprised steadily about 4% in the differently sized samples, the ratio of elemental sulfur to iron was approximately constant 0.3, and no demonstrable influence of pollutants from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning was detected. These results suggest that sulfate could be substantially derived from surface soil at the desert area and the lack of awareness of this origin may impede accurate results in any investigation of atmospheric sulfur chemistry associated with Taklimakan dust and its subsequent local, regional and global effects on the atmosphere. Citation: Wu, F., D. Zhang, J. Cao, H. Xu, and Z. An 2012 , Soil-derived sulfate in atmospheric dust particles at Taklimakan desert, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L24803, doi: 10.1029/2012GL054406. . They also modify the chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols, take part in hydrological processes in the air, link geographically distant ecosystems, and supply nutrients to remote terrestrial and marine biospheres.. Suspended in the air, dust particles can be changed by surface chemical reactions and the coagulation and coalescence with other particulate matter. In the downstream marine atmosphere, they were frequently coated with sulfate and nitrate and mixed with sea salt. It has been reported that sulfate coating on dust particles can lower their effective deliquescence RH, and may modify the particles in phase and size. These changes in turn feed back into many other chemical and physical processes that relate to radiative energy distribution within the atmosphere. Moreover, the presence of sulfate on mineral dust particles is able to increase the bioavailability of iron, which was supposed to be a key process for atmospheric dust to fertilize marine phytoplankton.. It was the consequence of reactive gases e.g., SO 2 adsorbed and oxidized on dust particles or the direct uptake of acidic gases, that was then fully or partially neutralized by alkaline components. This has been considered extensively in the assessment of sulfate formation in associated with dust, particularly for Asian dust.. The mass percentage of sulfate in surface soil 0–5 cm where salt lakes developed is usually larger than 1%, and up to 28.8% in cases, such as Ebinur Lake. In this regard, it has been suggested that surface soil could bring sulfate into the air as dust storms occur. S-containing dust particles were detected over the source and downwind regions of Asian dust in the continental atmosphere. S in particles with S/Ca ratio close to 0.8 was regarded as gypsum and distinguished from potentially secondary sulfate in the study of . Because of the surrounding mountains, dust from there is usually lifted over 5000 m and transported over a long distance to the Pacific Ocean and beyond, even around the globe. The desert continuously releases mineral aerosol to elevated layers and is considered to be an important source of atmospheric background dust in free troposphere over East Asia. Therefore, understanding sulfate in dust particles at the desert areas is expected to be particularly important for discussing the sulfur chemistry associated with Taklimakan dust on a local, regional and global scale in the atmosphere. Here, we report the results about the sulfate we observed, show the evidence of its soil origin, and discuss the potential importance of the results. Meteorological conditions including wind direction, wind speed, temperature, pressure, relative humidity, precipitation and visibility were automatically recorded within the observatories. A dust storm occurred at 13:00 on 17 April Local time and lasted to 26 April. Both observatories recorded the whole process almost simultaneously. At Aksu, the wind speed was weak less 2.5 m s −1 and the visibility was fine about 40 km before 17 April. At midday of April 17, the wind speed increased rapidly at the dust storm arrival. In the following two days 18–20 April , the air at the two sites was quite turbid and the visibility was 500–5000 m. After 14:00 on 20 April, the wind became weak and the visibility increased, but lots of fine dust particles were still suspended in the air. According to the guidelines on dust observation of the Meteorological Observing Criteria issued by the National Weather Bureau of China, the whole sampling period could be further divided into non-dust period ND period: before 18 April , dust storm period DS period: 18–20 April and floating dust period FD period: 21–26 April . It has to be noticed that the suspended particulate matters at the two observatories in all periods, including the ND period, were always dominated by mineral dust except for the large variation of the mass concentration under different dust conditions. and Mass . The sulfate in coarse dust particles diameter > 3 [1996]suggested investigating the correlation of S content with particle surface area and volume to identify if S appeared on the surface of or in dust particles. It was likely a probable approach for an extensive investigation of soil-derived sulfate in dust particles.[26]  Processing of dust particles in association with sulfate formation in the atmosphere is critical to their climatic and environmental effects. The results of this study warrant that sulfate in mineral dust particles at the downstream areas of the Asian continent could be from surface soil if the particles are from the Taklimakan desert. Thus it is not safe to attribute sulfate in atmospheric dust samples totally to secondary species in the elevated levels over the Northern Pacific and its marginal areas. The production of sulfate via particle surface reactions might be largely overestimated without evaluating its soil-derived part although how to investigate this issue is still a difficult task at the current stage. Since dust from the Taklimakan desert contributes largely to mineral particles in the free troposphere and frequently has an environmental effect from local to global scale, the lack of awareness of this origin may impede accurate results in any investigation of the sulfur chemistry associated with Taklimakan dust and the subsequent local, regional and global effects on the atmosphere."
56,dust,"The importance of the diurnal cycle of Aerosol Optical Depth in West Africa. High resolution atmospheric simulations with the AROME model coupled with a dust module over West Africa for the whole of June 2006 were used to calculate aerosol optical thickness AOT . Simulations showed a significant diurnal cycle of 0.2 in the dust AOT that could not be inferred from the MODIS Deep Blue retrievals due to their timings. Dust sources are mainly driven by the breakdown of the early morning low-level jet and by moist convection in the afternoon, leading to opposite diurnal cycles. Also, simulations show that cloud cover significantly prevents the observation of AOT. The under-sampling of the diurnal cycle by satellites plus the impact of cloud masks on the space-borne AOT retrievals induce an underestimation of 0.28 similar to 40% over the convective regions and an overestimation of 0.1 17% over morning source areas like Bodele. A combination of observations and high-resolution models could constrain bias and give a more realistic AOT climatology. Citation: Kocha, C., P. Tulet, J.-P. Lafore, and C. Flamant 2013 , The importance of the diurnal cycle of Aerosol Optical Depth in West Africa, Geophys. Res. Lett., 40, 785-790, doi: 10.1002/grl.50143. , and its indirect influence on microphysical cloud processes. These effects of dust depend on its chemical and physical properties, concentration and spatial and temporal distribution. However, these properties exhibit great, but scarcely documented, variability. Thus dusts are one of the major sources of uncertainty in the projection of climatic changes and their interpretation. The large quantities of aerosols emitted in these regions strongly modify the vertical stability of the atmosphere and the associated atmospheric processes. For these reasons, accurate distributions of dust need to be implemented in numerical weather predicting models to improve their forecasts. and can contribute to 50% of the dust production during June. There is now evidence that space-borne retrievals underestimate the AOT over the Sahara because i haboobs cannot always be observed below the often wide anvils of convective systems, and ii haboobs in West Africa generally occur in the afternoon and the evening, between the times when the most relevant satellite is passing over.. In particular, since parameterisations of moist convection are ineffective at generating cold pool outflows and propagating convective systems, models can underestimate the emission of dust on the order of 50% over West Africa. and high occurrence of deep convection. Our results raise some questions about the accuracy of current dust climatology used in atmospheric models, which is mostly based on satellite observations or GCM simulations. available from the Giovanni Web portal http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni . TERRA and AQUA orbit the Earth on heliosynchronous platforms that cross the equator at 1030 and 1330 local time, respectively. Comparisons between the Deep Blue and AERONET AODs are generally within 20–30% of each other, as demonstrated by Salustro et al . using AQUA collection 5.1 data from July 2002 to December 2008 over the Sahara and the Arabian Peninsula. The 1° x 1° pixels affected by clouds for more than 80% of the time and those for which the AOT standard deviation was greater than 2.5 were removed before computing the monthly mean for June 2006., which calculates dust fluxes from wind friction speeds, and with the lognormal aerosol model ORILAM. ORILAM represents the transport and the wet and dry deposition of three lognormal modes representing the fine, accumulation and coarse modes of desert dusts, which are derived from AMMA measurements. The refractive index of the dust aerosols was derived from AERONET. ORILAM calculates the radiative dust properties extinction coefficient, asymmetry factor and single scattering albedo coupled on-line with the ECMWF 2004 radiation scheme. More details and references are provided in Kocha et al .. The high resolution permit deep convection to be explicitly resolved and the dust lifting, transport and deposit to be correctly represented. For all of the 6-day forecasts performed for June 2006, Kocha has shown that, after the first day of simulation corresponding to the spin up time of the model , no model drift is detected for the following 5 days i.e. from Day 2 to Day 6 for each forecast . The present study used Day 2 to Day 5 of each forecast to cover the entire month of June. and for each day of June 2006, showing good agreement with observations from 7 AERONET stations and with Deep Blue daily mean AOTs.. In contrast, the simulated AOT was stronger than that retrieved by Deep Blue around mountainous areas such as the Western flanks of the Hoggar, the Adrar des Iforas and the Aïr. The dust detected by the brightness temperature difference from SEVERI suggests a higher occurrence of haboobs in these mountainous areas than over the Bodélé between June and August. This is consistent with the study by Mbourou et al . who have shown that, over the Western Sahara, the observed horizontal visibility in Timbuktu 16°43'N; 03°00'W , Hassi Messaoud 31°40'N; 06°09'E and Zouerate 22°41'N; 12°42'W has a strong diurnal cycle attributable to convection with the highest frequency ~53 days/year of visibility reaching less than 5 km around 1500 UTC and the lowest frequency ~22 days/year around 0600 UTC. and Bodélé. Figure  3 a shows the monthly mean of the diurnal cycle of the AOT over these two boxes. Deep Blue mean retrievals are represented by 2 black filled circles for the Adrar box and 2 white squares for the Bodélé box. The two data points in each box correspond to the TERRA 0930 UTC and AQUA 1230 UTC overpasses. The amplitude of the diurnal fluctuations of AOT is large, being about 0.2 peak to peak at both locations. The most striking feature is the phase opposition of the diurnal cycle between the two regions: the AOT is maximum at 1200 UTC over Bodélé while it is maximum at 22UTC over the Adrar region.Composite diurnal cycle averaged over June 2006 and plotted over 48 h for the Bodélé box. The 10-m wind speed reaches a maximum shortly before the maximum of dust-related AOT in the Bodélé box as winds are sufficiently strong to generate dust uplifts Figure  3 a . has diagnosed the occurrence of density currents by using the variance of the 10-m wind speed, 2-m humidity and 2-m temperatures inside 1° x 1° boxes. The fact that the large 10-m wind speed variance values are seen between 1500 and 1800 UTC in Figure  3 b strongly suggests that the maximum of variance is related to density currents or cold pools , and hence convection. Furthermore, the maximum of AOT in the Adrar box is seen at 2200 UTC, i.e. after the density currents have entered the region, and is consistent with the propagation of haboobs. Over Bodélé, the wind variance shows a weak maximum. It may also be that the soil granulometry in that region is not well represented, thereby making the 17% discussed above a conservative estimate. Overall, the effect of the limited sampling of the satellite explains ~0.1 of the 0.2 AOT offset between Deep Blue and model mean AOTs for the Bodele i.e. 50% . Commonly available AOT climatologies are generally based on polar-orbiting satellites with wide-field-of-view instruments on board that provide the highest possible horizontal resolution as well as the best coverage on a daily basis. However, high resolution simulations of dust emission and subsequent transport and scavenging with AROME performed for the whole month of June 2006 evidenced discrepancies up to 0.3 between the observations and the AOT fields output by the model., it can be assessed that non-convection-permitting models that do not explicitly resolve convection will probably underestimate dust emissions due to density currents in West and North Africa even if they have a built-in dust module . Today, the reliability of parameterizations and the increased computational capabilities of newly available high-resolution models give a better representation of the processes involved in dust formation and transport at the relevant scales. They can provide another quite realistic and complementary way to estimate the distribution of aerosols. Here, we stress that the diurnal cycle of dust concentration over West Africa is pronounced. Because dusts have a significant radiative forcing that can impact meteorological forecasts, the dust fields from both NWP and climate models need to be assessed against a realistic AOT climatology. We propose a combination of observations and convection-permitting models here to constrain bias and build a more realistic AOT climatology.[28]  MODIS deep blue aerosol optical depth used in this study were produced with the Giovanni online data system, developed and maintained by the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences GES Data and Information Services Center DISC .

88,particles aerosol climate clouds,"Recent increase in black carbon concentrations from a Mt. Everest ice core spanning 1860-2000 AD. A Mt. Everest ice core spanning 1860-2000 AD and analyzed at high resolution for black carbon BC using a Single Particle Soot Photometer SP2 demonstrates strong seasonality, with peak concentrations during the winter-spring, and low concentrations during the summer monsoon season. BC concentrations from 1975-2000 relative to 1860-1975 have increased approximately threefold, indicating that BC from anthropogenic sources is being transported to high elevation regions of the Himalaya. The timing of the increase in BC is consistent with BC emission inventory data from South Asia and the Middle East, however since 1990 the ice core BC record does not indicate continually increasing BC concentrations. The Everest BC and dust records provide information about absorbing impurities that can contribute to glacier melt by reducing the albedo of snow and ice. There is no increasing trend in dust concentrations since 1860, and estimated surface radiative forcing due to BC in snow exceeds that of dust in snow. This suggests that a reduction in BC emissions may be an effective means to reduce the effect of absorbing impurities on snow albedo and melt, which affects Himalayan glaciers and the availability of water resources in major Asian rivers. Citation: Kaspari, S. D., M. Schwikowski, M. Gysel, M. G. Flanner, S. Kang, S. Hou, and P. A. Mayewski 2011 , Recent increase in black carbon concentrations from a Mt. Everest ice core spanning 1860-2000 AD, Geophys. Res. Lett., 38, L04703, doi: 10.1029/2010GL046096. Black carbon BC, the absorbing component of soot produced by the incomplete combustion of biomass, coal and diesel fuels can significantly contribute to climate change by altering the Earth's radiative balance. BC in the atmosphere absorbs light and causes atmospheric heating, whereas BC deposited on snow and ice can significantly reduce the surface albedo, hasten melt, and trigger albedo feedback. BC is estimated to have 55% of the radiative forcing effect of CO 2 , yet BC remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in analyses of climate change.Records of BC mass concentration and spatial and temporal distribution in the atmosphere are needed to determine the role of BC in climate change. BC has a mean atmospheric residence time of several days, thus the global distribution is inhomogeneous and strongly correlated to sources. As a result, BC measurements are needed from many locations. Modern measurements of BC have been made on aerosol and precipitation samples, however historical records of BC are scarce. Thus, studies assessing the role of BC in climate change have relied on inventories of carbonaceous particle emissions based on wood and/or fossil fuel consumption data. However, many important BC sources such as residential emissions from cooking and heating are very difficult to estimate in the present, even more difficult to estimate for the past, and can vary greatly through time and with location. Thus, more quantitative measurements of BC emissions and atmospheric concentrations as a function of time are needed to estimate climate change related to BC forcing. Ice cores from ice sheets and mountain glaciers provide a means to reconstruct historical BC concentrations.Reconstructing BC concentrations in the Himalayas is particularly important because this region is influenced by some of the largest BC sources globally, with negative impacts on climate, water resources, agriculture and human health. Furthermore, it is estimated that the largest climate forcing from BC in snow occurs over the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau, and modeling studies suggest that BC is contributing to glacier retreat via atmospheric heating and BC deposition on glacier surfaces. Herein we present a high-resolution BC record from a Mt. Everest ice core spanning 1860–2000 AD. This provides the first pre-industrial to present record of BC concentrations from the Himalayas.In 2002 a 108 m ice core was collected from the col of the East Rongbuk glacier located on the northeast ridge of Mt. Everest 28.03 N, 86.96 E, 6518 m on the north slope of the Himalaya. The ice core was analyzed for BC using a Single Particle Soot Photometer SP2, Droplet Measurement Technologies , a BC analytical technique first applied to ice cores by. The SP2 uses laser-induced incandescence to measure the BC mass in individual particles quantitatively and independent of particle morphology and coatings with light scattering material. Specifically, the SP2 detects only the mass concentration of refractory black carbon sometimes referred to as rBC; the term BC is used here for simplicity , while other absorbing aerosol components such as brownish carbon or mineral dust are not detected by the SP2. The high sensitivity and small required sample volume enables ice cores to be analyzed at much higher resolution than thermal-optical methods. Additional information about the ice core processing, chemical analyses, dating, SP2 calibration and BC mass size distribution are discussed in the auxiliary material .The high-resolution BC data demonstrates strong seasonality, with peak concentrations during the winter-spring when atmospheric circulation is dominated by the westerlies, and low concentrations during the summer monsoon season, when southerly winds are dominant at the surface. The BC seasonality is illustrated by comparing the BC record with: 1 dust source elements e.g., Fe that peak during the winter and spring due to unstable atmospheric conditions and strong winds, and 2 the more negative hydrogen stable isotope ratio δ D due to strong monsoon activity during the summer Figure 1 . The ice core BC seasonality is consistent with previous findings, including: soot particles measured in snow pits at the same site; atmospheric measurements in the Khumbu Valley, Nepal 5079 m asl ; and other atmospheric measurements in the region. a High-resolution BC, Iron Fe and δ D from the Everest ice core spanning 1975–1985 AD. b BC emission data; Everest ice core BC including inset with logarithmic scale to show changes in background concentrations , and iron used as a proxy for dust . The Everest ice core data are re-sampled to 4 samples/year black due to differences in sampling resolution over time, and smoothed with a robust spline red .Factors controlling BC seasonality include variations in emissions, atmospheric transport, and precipitation. For example, in the Kathmandu valley brick kilns that utilize coal and other biofuels only operate in the dry months between December and April, and biomass burning emissions from regions in South Asia peak during spring. The winter-spring in this region of the Himalayas is particularly dry, thus the lifetime of BC and other aerosols in the atmosphere can be prolonged. Conversely, the majority of precipitation occurs during the summer monsoon season, resulting in the wet removal of BC and other aerosols from the atmosphere. As a result, summer precipitation in this region typically has low BC concentrations.To investigate changes in BC since 1860, the high-resolution data were re-sampled to 4 samples/year to correct for differences in sampling resolution with depth in the ice core. Average BC concentrations from 1860–1975 and 1975–2000 were 0.2 ± 0.3 μ g/L and .7 ± 1.0 μ g/L, respectively, indicating a threefold increase in BC concentrations from pre-industrial to industrial times Figure 1b herein reported BC concentrations and radiative forcing estimates represent lower limit values due to potential particle losses in the nebulizer . The increase is most apparent in peak BC concentrations maximum BC = 32 μ g/L in 1984 , however background concentrations also rise from ∼0.05 μ g/L prior to 1960 to ∼0.10 μ g/L post 1960. Higher BC concentrations in recent decades indicate that BC from anthropogenic sources is being transported to high elevation regions of the Himalaya.The increase in Everest BC during the 1970s is simultaneous with a rise in BC emissions as estimated from historical records of energy-related combustion in South Asia and the Middle East Figure 1b . Based on dominant atmospheric circulation patterns and previous back-trajectory research, these regions are likely sources of BC that is deposited at Mt. Everest. BC emissions in South Asia are substantially higher than the Middle East, particularly in recent decades, and northern regions of India may be a dominant source of BC transported to Everest via the westerlies. However, BC emissions from South Asia continue to increase throughout the record, whereas BC in the Everest record does not increase post ∼1990. The Everest BC record likely represents trends in BC emissions from both regional and long-range sources, potentially including the Former USSR and Eastern Europe, where BC emissions have decreased in recent decades Figure 1b . Western Europe and China are likely not important sources of BC transported to the Everest ice core site, as Western European sources peaked in 1960 and have since decreased, and BC emissions from China are downwind from the Himalaya. In addition to changes in BC emissions, deposited BC is also controlled by variations in the strength and pathways of winds that transport the BC from source regions to high elevations. Due to the extreme topography in this region, the mountain meteorology is complex and it is difficult to constrain inter-annual variability in vertical transport processes that allow BC from relatively low elevation source regions to be transported to the high elevation ice core drill site.BC deposited at Everest likely has both fossil and bio-fuel sources. BC fossil fuel sources include coal, petrol and diesel used in power generation, transportation, domestic uses and steel and cement manufacturing, whereas major BC bio-fuel sources include cattle manure, fuel wood, agricultural residue burning and forest fires. Previous attempts to apportion BC to biomass and fossil fuel sources have produced varying results depending on the approach used e.g., ratios of BC to total carbon; emission inventories based on fuel consumption , with recent radiocarbon measurements from India indicating that one half to two thirds of BC emissions result from biomass combustion.In addition to providing a record of historical BC concentrations in the atmosphere, the Everest BC and dust records supply information about absorbing impurities that can contribute to glacier melt by reducing the albedo of snow and ice. Notably, the Everest Fe record, used as a proxy for dust Figure 1b , and dust number and mass records do not show an increasing trend since 1860. This is significant because it suggests that if the recent retreat of glaciers in the region is due, at least in part, to the effect of impurities on snow albedo, the reduced albedo is more likely due to increased BC deposition rather than dust.BC is estimated to be fifty times more effective than dust at reducing the visible snow albedo, although dust absorptivity is highly variable. Due to the prevalence of dust in this region, the relative importance of BC versus dust in reducing snow albedo has not been clear. A recent modeling study estimated that the Eurasian spring radiative forcing RF from dust and BC in snow is 1.2 and 2.7 W/m2, respectively. We used the Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative SNICAR model to estimate the RF from BC and dust in snow. We assume that BC is internally mixed with scattering aerosol components and thus use a mass absorption cross section of 11.3 m 2 /g. Average 466 ppb and peak 3388 ppb dust mass concentrations and size distribution are from measurements made on the same ice core and dust optical properties are derived from. Surface RF measurements were calculated with varying snow effective radii, with 250 μ m representing a central estimate, and 100 and 1000 μ m bracketing the plausible range associated with variable snow grain size Table 1 .Surface radiative forcing based on SNICAR is due to BC in snow in the presence of dust, unless specifically noted as no BC, in which case the radiative forcing is due to dust in snow. Here r is snow effective radius; dust is dust mass concentration.Average based on 4 samples/year data.Based on high resolution data.The average spring March–April BC RF in the presence of average dust concentrations increased from 0.11 250 μ m 0.07 100 μ m ; 0.22 1000 μ m W/m 2 from 1860–1974 to 0.36 250 μ m 0.22 100 μ m ; 0.69 1000 μ m W/m 2 from 1975–2000, indicating a threefold increase in RF from BC in snow Table 1 and Figure 2a . Despite higher incoming solar radiation during the summer, the BC RF in snow is considerably lower during the summer monsoon season July–September due to much lower BC concentrations during this time Figure 2b . Nevertheless, average summer monsoon RF from 1975–2000 is twofold higher than 1860–1974. As mentioned previously, the 1860–2000 timeseries is re-sampled to 4 samples/year. This results in a smoothing of the record, precluding examination of RF from peak impurity concentrations. Thus, the high-resolution record from 1975–1985, representing the time period with peak impurity concentrations, was re-sampled at monthly resolution 12 samples/year to further examine BC RF peak values and seasonality. Monthly mean RF is highly seasonal, with a peak BC RF of 6.05 250 μ m 3.85 100 μ m , 11.46 1000 μ m W/m 2 occurring during the spring Figure 2c .BC radiative forcing W/m 2 in the presence of average dust mass concentration 466 ppb as determined using SNICAR for snow effective radii r = 150 blue ; 250 green and 1000 μ m from a March–April b July–September, and c monthly mean. Additional model parameters are discussed in the text.The previous analyses consider the BC RF in the presence of average dust levels. Because we are interested in the relative contributions of BC and dust to the RF and reductions in snow albedo, we also ran SNICAR for r = 250 μ m with BC and varying dust concentrations, and without BC. The average spring BC RF in the presence of peak dust concentrations 3388 ppb is less than that with average dust concentrations because the dust captures some of the solar absorption that the BC would receive under less dusty conditions Table 1 . Omission of dust results in the highest BC RF. Conversely, the dust RF in the absence of BC is highly dependent on dust concentrations, with a spring dust RF of .11 and .77 W/m 2 for average and peak dust concentrations, respectively. This peak dust RF is still considerably less than peak BC RF from the high-resolution record, supporting the conclusions from previous studies suggesting that a reduction in BC emissions would be the most effective means by which to reduce the impact of absorbing impurities on albedo and snow melt. Full snowpack/glacier modeling would be needed to assess impacts on snowmelt of specific BC reductions. Additionally, our current analyses do not address other absorbing impurities in the snowpack that also can contribute to reductions in albedo such as additional sources of light absorbing carbon colored organics from biomass burning, humic-like substances, snow algae and bacteria.Spatial heterogeneity in BC concentrations due to differences in BC sources and transport is evident when comparing the results of this study with BC ice core records from other regions of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau spanning ∼1950 to recent time: cores from the Tibetan Plateau have relatively high BC concentrations during the 1950s–1960s, whereas peak BC concentrations in a core from Zuoqiupu in the Eastern Himalaya occurred post 1990. The BC spatial variations, combined with differences in the amount and seasonality of precipitation and dust deposition, results in a heterogeneous pattern of snow and glacier melt across the region."
110,aerosol ocean,"Biogeochemical implications of increased mineral particle concentrations in surface waters of the northwestern North Pacific during an Asian dust event. Simultaneous observations were made in the marine atmospheric boundary layer and surface ocean during spring 2007 to investigate potential impacts of Asian dust on a semi-pelagic region of the northwestern North Pacific. The results suggest that mineral dust aerosols were scavenged by sea fog, and their deposition to the ocean increased the particle concentration in surface seawater. The atmospheric input of mineral dust to the ocean surface from this event was calculated to be 40 to 680 mg m -2 event -1 . A general relationship for the solubility of iron from dust particles led to an estimate of 20 to 330 mu g m -2 for the amount of bio-available iron delivered during the dust event. This input of bio-available iron is comparable to total dissolved iron added during an iron fertilization experiment in the northwestern North Pacific in which an enhancement of primary production was observed.

Lett., 38, L01604, doi:10.1029/2010GL045906. . The western North Pacific is one of the largest High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll HNLC areas of the world's oceans, accounting for 20 to 30% of the total ocean area where primary production is limited by iron. When mineral dust aerosols deposit onto the surface of HNLC waters, iron and other trace elements can dissolve into seawater and be utilized by phytoplankton as nutrients, thus enhancing primary production. Nonetheless, field observations made during sporadic Asian dust events are rather limited, and there are only a few studies that have investigated the impacts of atmospheric dust deposition on oceanic biogeochemical cycles.. Seawater sampling was also performed with a polyethylene bucket for surface 0 m samples and with Niskin bottles to obtain vertical profiles 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 m at ten hydrocast stations hereinafter abbreviated as Stns, Figure 1a . a Cruise tracks for the R/V Tansei-Maru KT-07-7 April 18–29, 2007 showing aerosol number concentrations. The gray and white circles mark SPM sampling stations during the Dust event and non-dusty periods, respectively. b Geographical distribution of accumulated dust deposition flux from 15 to 30 April 2007 simulated by a numerical model. Typical seven-day backward-in-time trajectories, with relative humidity conditions, for during the Dust event are also shown. The lines numbered 1 and 2 denote dusty air masses, and the lines numbered 3 and 4 indicate air masses with sea fog. The total dust deposition over the area encompassed by the brown line 36–44°N, east of 145°E; 812.8 × 10 3 km 2 was 176 Gg.., incorporating in it the dust extinction coefficient derived from the NIES Lidar network.. The concentrations of nitrate, a macronutrient for the phytoplankton, in surface water varied among the stations Table 1 . Warm water Stns 1, 2, 9, 11 and 12 had high nitrate 4.7 to 6.5 study was transported through intermediate waters 1000 to 2000 m depth , not the surface. On the other hand, Stns 5 and 6 are located near the coast of Hokkaido, Japan; and therefore at those stations, lateral advection may have provided significant quantities of lithogenic material, thus lessening the relative contribution of atmospheric deposition. Figure S2a of the auxiliary material . The relative abundances of Al-Si particles in surface water, during the Dust event and non-dusty periods were 30% and 15% by particle number, respectively; these values are much higher than the 3.6% that was observed during the summer, a low dust period, in a previous study. These results are further evidence that mineral dust aerosols deposited onto sea surface can be a major source of SPM MP . An iron fertilization experiment SEEDS II was conducted in a HNLC area of the northwestern North Pacific in the summer of 2004, and during that study an increase in phytoplankton standing stock in the iron-fertilized water was observed. The dissolved iron artificially added to the mixed layer led to an iron concentration of 13 reported a Fe/C molar ratio of 3.1 × 10 −4 to 2.1 × 10 −3 for sinking particles during iron fertilization experiments. If 1 the receiving waters are indeed iron limited, i.e., light, mixing and other factors do not control phytoplankton growth and 2 all of dissolved iron from a dust event is used by the phytoplankton, then 10 to 60 Gg of carbon would be exported from the surface to deep waters. This estimate for a single dust event an average of 29 days for Asian dust events has been observed in Japan during spring from 2000 to 2008; http://www.data.kishou.go.jp/obs -env/kosahp/kosa_data_index.html corresponds to about 0.004 to 0.02% of the net annual sink for CO 2 in the northern North Pacific 35 to 54°N , 2.6 × 10 5 Gg yr −1 . Our results therefore imply that Asian dust deposition could substantially influence the oceanic carbon cycle, and this effect would likely be even larger during dustier times."
361,impact,"Satellite observations cap the atmospheric organic aerosol budget. Limited understanding of the production and loss of organic aerosol OA to the atmosphere has resulted in poorly constrained source estimates ranging from 140 to 910 TgCyr -1 [Goldstein and Galbally, 2007]. We use satellite observations to quantitatively estimate the atmospheric burden of organic aerosol and the associated production. We find that attributing the mid-visible continental aerosol optical depth AOD observed by the MISR satellite entirely to OA implies a global source of 430 TgCyr -1 of sub-micron OA. We use a model GEOS-Chem to remove the contribution of inorganic aerosol, dust and soot from the observed AOD and derive a continental OA production of 150 TgCyr -1 equivalent burden of 2.5 TgC , with 80% uncertainty. This result significantly reduces the uncertainty in the global OA budget and provides an upper limit for the ""missing source"" of OA. Citation: Heald, C. L., D. A. Ridley, S. M. Kreidenweis, and E. E. Drury 2010 , Satellite observations cap the atmospheric organic aerosol budget, Geophys. Res. Lett., 37, L24808, doi:10.1029/2010GL045095. . However poor understanding of the formation and evolution of OA in the atmosphere, as well as limited measurements of organic aerosol throughout the troposphere, translate to large uncertainties on the global OA budget. Source estimates occupy a wide range of values from 140 to 910 TgCyr −1 . These estimates exceed sources included in current models e.g., 47 TgCyr −1 . While some field studies support a large missing source of OA in models, others report good agreement between simulated and measured concentrations. We use satellite observations to investigate whether there is evidence for a sizeable missing source of OA., which by scattering solar radiation acts to cool the Earth and counter some of the warming from greenhouse gases. The International Governmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that emissions of sulfur dioxide the precursor to sulfate will decline in coming decades with the implementation of control technologies and the use of cleaner fuels. While an aerosol clean-up has clear air quality benefits, it may accelerate some of the GHG warming “in the pipeline”. This potential effect intensifies the need to understand the budgets of aerosols in the atmosphere which share the scattering properties of sulfate.. . Regions which are overestimated in the model Figure 1 are generally associated with dust or dust transport , in common with many models. We use MISR AOD observations to constrain the global OA budget; comparisons with AERONET and MODIS are shown in Supplementary Materials Figures S2 – S4 . A detailed error analysis follows these estimates.Total aerosol optical depth for left winter and right summer 2008 as a measured by MISR at 555 nm and b simulated by the GEOS-Chem model at 550 nm without OA as sampled for the MISR overpass AERONET ground-based sunphotometer network observations at 550 nm overlayed in Figure 1a . c The difference and d the inverted surface concentrations when assuming a constant mixing ratio profile. If we assume that OA makes up the entire AOD and invert for the burden implied by the continental MISR observations, we estimate a source of 215 TgCyr −1 . This source must be doubled to account for the continental OA exported in outflow based on a GEOS-Chem model estimate that 40–60% of OA is exported over the ocean . The continental OA burden required to account for the AOD observed by MISR is therefore estimated at a maximum of 7.0 TgC associated source of 430 TgCyr −1 . This reduces the likely range of OA sources by more than half. A uniform vertical mixing ratio of OA was specified for simplicity when inverting the AOD. Such a profile seems unlikely given the efficient removal of OA in precipitating air masses, however additional production aloft may provide a compensatory source. There are few constraints on the vertical profile of OA in the atmosphere. For the purpose of calculating the OA budget we therefore invoke an intermediate vertical distribution: an exponentially decreasing profile characterized by the scale height of the atmosphere. When the same mass in the uniform profile is re-distributed to such a shape the global mean AOD increases by 15% due to additional water uptake near the surface. As a result, 15% less mass would be required to match the MISR observations. Our optimized continental OA source therefore totals 150 TgCyr −1 equivalent atmospheric burden of 2.5 TgC . Using AOD to constrain the OA source implies substantial uncertainties on the derived budget. Table 1 summarizes the factors contributing to these uncertainties estimated 95% confidence intervals . The most important factors are the OA optical properties used to convert from AOD to mass and the OA lifetime assessed to convert the burden to a global source.Unless RH > 90% in which case uncertainty is significantly large ∼50% . These dry refractive indices include values suggested by Jacobson . We also test the difference in mass extinction efficiency produced when the dry refractive indices determined for several types of HULIS or Suwannee River Fulvic Acid are employed. The calculated mass extinction efficiencies all fall within 20% of our standard values. Note that uncertainty associated with the organic refractive index is highest at low relative humidity, where organic material makes up more of the aerosol mass. The OA growth factor GF=D wet /D dry at 90% used here 1.6 is less than typical values for sulfate 1.7–1.8 , higher than environments characterized by biomass burning 1.2–1.3 , and at the higher end of GF observed in rural environments and is thus likely representative of well-aged OA. Given uncertainties regarding how mixing state and organic composition may affect the water uptake of organic aerosol, we estimate a 20% uncertainty in GF. We use volume mixing rules to calculate the resulting changes in refractive indices, and use these together with changes in size to calculate that the uncertainty in mass extinction efficiency due to the uptake in water is less than 10%. Uncertainties in relative humidity estimated at 5% translate to modest uncertainties in extinction efficiency for most continental regions, but can rival the uncertainty associated with optics and lifetime in very humid regions.. We expect uncertainties to be considerably lower for the seasonal averages used here, and estimate this at 10%. We note that satellite observations of AOD are clear-sky only. This may underestimate the total OA burden if a significant fraction is found in-cloud, for example, due to aqueous phase production, or in the case where persistent clouds coincide with peak OA over a particular region and season. Finally, we assess a 25% uncertainty in the global seasonal AOD calculated for inorganics, dust and soot in the GEOS-Chem model. This is consistent with the total AOD diversity for the sum of these species estimated for the suite of models in the AEROCOM intercomparison. Note that uncertainties on the simulated AOD may be higher for specific locations or days.. While the “missing source” of OA assessed here is modest in comparison, it is a factor of two to three higher than sources included in current models. This empirical estimate cannot be used to decipher the mechanisms of OA production, however the seasonality of the inverted source which peaks in local Spring/Summer, inset of Figure 2 hints at a relationship to biogenic activity including summer wildfires or enhanced photochemical activity. Attribution of this seasonality is key not only to understanding formation mechanisms, but also the broader question of what fraction of OA is natural in origin. Characterization of the aerosol composition of the global atmosphere, including the contribution from OA, is critical to our ability to predict the future radiative equilibrium of the Earth.Continental OA source estimates derived here compared with the estimates of Goldstein and Galbally [2007] . Seasonality of the estimated burden is shown in the inset."
119,dust,"Can global models ignore the chemical composition of aerosols?. The number of cloud droplets formed from a population of aerosols depends on the aerosol number concentration, N-A, the size distribution, and the chemical composition. The cloud albedo effect occurs when increasing N-A causes increases to the droplet concentration, N-D. We examined the effects of changing aerosol size, composition, and number on N-D within the United States. We found that changing the water-soluble organic carbon WSOC fraction from 50% to 0.05% in the fine mode aerosol and from 50% to 95% in the coarse mode aerosol decreased N-D by an average of 34%. Our results show that the changes to the aerosol composition cause over a 20% change to N-D, a magnitude previously estimated to cause a 1 W m -2 change in radiative forcing. Given the realistic range of aerosol compositions used here, it is not possible for global models to correctly calculate the cloud albedo effect if composition is ignored. Citation: Roesler, E.

The mean N D in cm −3 of all regions for each test case is listed after the percentage.Test case acronym is listed in bold. The inter-regional variation standard deviation divided by the mean N D shows how the changes in composition between regions or changes in the microphysical variables affect N D . A high inter-regional variation value of N D for a case implies an empirical relationship of N D based on a region's value would not be accurate if applied to other regions. Figures 1b – 1e show N D cm −3 in every region for a subset of the test cases from Table 1 . Changes in composition between regions cause an inter-regional variation in N D of 8% when all the seasons are averaged Figure 1b , and a 15% variation of N D in the spring Figure 1e . The mean N D is increased by 6% to 534 cm −3 in spring compared to the annual average mostly due to a factor-of-two average increase in  Figure 2 shows the computed N D at the maximum supersaturation, S max , for test cases 5–12 against base case NS separated into two S max ranges.

In both Figures 2a and 2b, cases NSH, NSst, and NSWin have correlations of ∼1.0 with slopes of ∼1.0.. In this study, it was found that the aerosol size distribution and composition cannot be ignored by global models when calculating the N D for the cloud albedo, which is based aerosol compositions measured in the United States from 1988 to 2004. These results are based on assumptions regarding the size-resolved and physicochemical properties of WSOC. Changing these assumptions would affect N D , and further sensitivity studies could identify which WSOC properties were most important for modeling. A global model using an empirical relationship based on regional measurements could over- or under-predict N D when applied to other regions depending on differences in composition, the number of log-normal modes, N A , and σ g . Regional and seasonal differences in trace gas concentrations, organic, inorganic, and insoluble aerosol compositions cause high variability in N D , suggesting a more thorough treatment and not a simplification of aerosol composition is needed for an accurate prediction of N D ."
358,aerosol,"Chemical processing does not always impair heterogeneous ice nucleation of mineral dust particles. Exposing Arizona Test Dust ATD particles to nitric acid vapor in an aerosol flow tube impaired subsequent deposition ice nucleation below water-saturation, but promoted condensation/immersion-freezing on approach to water saturation and had no apparent impact on freezing of activated droplets above water saturation. The fraction of particles capable of nucleating ice at -30 degrees C was determined using a continuous flow diffusion chamber. Exposure to HNO 3 at 26% relative humidity with respect to water RH w reduced the fraction of particles subsequently nucleating ice to below our quantification limit in the deposition nucleation regime below 97% RH w , while leading to a sharper step-wise increase in ice nucleation between 97-100% RH w compared to unreacted dust. These observations contrast with the effect of concentrated sulfuric acid condensation, which in most cases has been reported to reduce ice nucleation of ATD and other dusts both below and above water saturation.

Kreidenweis 2010 , Chemical processing does not always impair heterogeneous ice nucleation of mineral dust particles, Geophys. Res. Lett., 37, L24805, doi: 10.1029/2010GL045540. . The ice nucleating ability of mineral dust depends on its mineralogy. Aluminosilicate clays are present in a large fraction of atmospheric dust particles and display relatively high ice nucleation ability. Two principal mechanisms of heterogeneous ice nucleation by insoluble nuclei such as mineral dust are deposition ice nucleation and condensation/immersion-freezing. Below water-saturation deposition-nucleation, the direct formation of ice on a particle's surface from an ice-supersaturated vapor, is expected to be the primary ice nucleation mechanism. Condensation and immersion-freezing occur when an insoluble IN freezes during or following the absorption of water, respectively, typically above water saturation. and this can potentially modify their ice nucleation ability. Previous laboratory studies on this subject have mostly focused on cirrus cloud temperatures below −40°C in the deposition-regime. Recent experiments performed at warmer temperatures and in both the deposition- and condensation/immersion-freezing regimes found that the ice nucleation ability of Arizona Test Dust ATD was reduced by the condensation of heated sulfuric acid vapors. Nitric acid readily reacts with alkaline components found in mineral dust particles and alters the warm cloud nucleation properties of dust particles, but its effect on ice nucleation has not yet been investigated. Here we present experimental results on the effect of nitric acid uptake on the ice nucleation properties of ATD at mixed-phase cloud temperatures of −30°C, both below and above water saturation.. The nitric acid volume fraction of the dust particles after reaction in the flow tube was estimated from the CCN activation curves by deriving the aerosol's hygroscopicity parameter, κ app , following  The ice nucleation properties of 200 nm ATD particles with and without reaction with nitric acid vapor were determined using the CSU CFDC, which permits the observation of ice nucleation from a continuously flowing aerosol sample. Briefly, the aerosol is passed between two ice-coated temperature controlled walls that determine the temperature and. Further details on the HNO 3 volume fraction estimates are provided in the auxiliary material . The fractions of particles that nucleated ice at different representative. The resulting increase in hygroscopicity could have permitted a thin aqueous layer to form around the particle during the 26% RH w exposures. More nitric acid vapor would have dissolved into this aqueous layer, and a nitric acid coating would then have formed when the aerosol was dried before analysis. Aqueous partitioning and the accelerated reaction kinetics explain the larger change in both hygroscopicity and f IN for exposures conducted at 26% RH w versus 0% RH w . By concealing active sites the nitric acid coating impaired deposition nucleation below water saturation. Some IN ability presumably remained for the smaller 0% RH w exposures due to an incomplete surface coating or heterogeneous treatment at low HNO 3 exposure. The concealed active sites were restored when water was absorbed and the coating diluted during hygroscopic growth and droplet activation, allowing the nitric acid to desorb from active sites, causing freezing of diluted drops to be unaffected. This hypothesis requires that nitric acid did not irreversibly alter active sites through chemical reactions. Alternatively, new unaltered active sites could have been revealed when the soluble reaction products were desorbed from the surface by dissolution. The observed complete deactivation of deposition-nucleation following HNO 3 exposure at 26% RH w suggests that all IN-active ATD particles contained enough nitric acid to inhibit ice nucleation, either through physisorption, or heterogeneous uptake if the particle contained carbonate minerals.. Exposure to nitric acid therefore produces a step-function shift between heterogeneous ice nucleation mechanisms: inhibiting deposition nucleation while facilitating condensation and immersion-freezing by increasing particle hygroscopicity without irreversibly altering ice active surface sites. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a distinct shift between ice nucleation mechanisms caused by the uptake of an acidic vapor.. A heated 45–85 °C tube was used to generate sulfuric acid vapor and coated particles were also exposed to these elevated temperatures. Those experiments revealed the accelerated loss of ice nucleation ability when coated particles were subsequently heated in a thermodenuder at 250 °C. Thus, we postulated that the heated vapor tube may have promoted the irreversible loss of active sites but that this loss may not occur from natural sulfuric acid condensation alone. Alternatively, the differing response may be due to different mechanisms of acid uptake by ATD e.g. condensation versus heterogeneous reactions , or differences in reactions and product properties of nitric acid and sulfuric acid reacting with ATD components. We note that while almost all relevant nitrate salts are soluble under the particle water contents experienced in the CFDC, many sulfate compounds have low solubility. The neutralization of nitric acid by alkaline dust components such as CaCO 3 and CaMg CO 3 2 which form soluble products including Ca NO 3 2 and Mg NO 3 2 that are subsequently desorbed by dilution from the particle surface to uncover new unaltered surface sites remains a likely possibility. In no case did nitric acid or sulfuric acid exposure increase f IN compared to untreated dust.. This study indicates that not only does exposure to nitric acid not impair particle freezing above water saturation, the addition of hygroscopic material can at some temperatures shift the onset of condensation-freezing to just below water saturation and homogenize the freezing behavior. This effect was achieved from just 8 ppb s HNO 3 exposure at 26% RH w . We previously calculated a timescale of only 4 hours for the near complete reaction of pure CaCO 3 particles with 10 ppt HNO 3 . As tropospheric humidity levels frequently exceed 26% RH w and nitric acid is present generally at >100 ppt, we can expect that most atmospheric dust particles that contain alkaline minerals will have already achieved this degree of processing before experiencing cloud nucleation events. Differences in dust mineralogy have been observed to influence the type of atmospheric processing that dust experiences, and the resulting changes in the dust's apparent hygroscopicity. Alkaline calcite and other carbonates can undergo heterogeneous reactions with nitric acid, and with other pollutant acids such as hydrochloric and oxalic acids. Following the mechanism we have proposed, the resulting increase in hygroscopicity that facilitates further uptake of acids can produce a secondary coating that conceals ice active sites and prevents deposition ice nucleation. Immersion-freezing is unaffected if the coating is reversibly desorbed off the particle surface during droplet nucleation. The mineralogy of the source dust will therefore play an important role in the ice nucleation properties of unprocessed dust, the types of processing the dust experiences, and the resulting ice nucleation properties of aged dust.. The alteration of the ice nucleation mechanism by nitric acid suggests that the effect of secondary pollutants mixing with mineral dust, and other ice nuclei, warrants further exploration and reconsideration. The addition of secondary material cannot be assumed to always impair ice nucleation, particularly when water saturation is achieved, as it is in mixed-phase clouds. As it appears that the degree of chemical processing required to deactivate deposition nucleation occurs readily under typical atmospheric conditions and residence times, it seems unlikely that a significant fraction of atmospheric dust particles will be able to nucleate ice below water saturation. However, atmospherically processed dust particles may remain efficient IN above water saturation."
112,dust,"Mineral quartz concentration measurements of mixed mineral dust/urban haze pollution plumes over Korea with multiwavelength aerosol Raman-quartz lidar. We present a case study of a concentration measurement of mineral quartz immersed in East Asian urban pollution. We use a novel lidar measurement technique that uses signals from Raman scattering from quartz at ultraviolet 360 nm wavelength. The particle-extinction-related Angstrom exponent wavelength pair 355/532 nm varies around 0.7 +/- 0.2, the lidar ratio is 50-55 sr at 532 nm. The numbers indicate that the pollution plume likely consisted of a mixture of mineral dust with urban haze. Dust concentrations vary between 8-11 mu/cm 3 . We determined Raman quartz concentrations from measurements simultaneously carried out at 546 nm, which allows us to measure for the first time the Raman-quartz-related Angstrom exponent of mineral dust. Values are 3-4, whereas we expect a theoretical value of 4. It is unclear if the lower values follow from retrieval uncertainties or if they are linked to the internal structure of the quartz grains.

Lett., 37, L20810, doi:10.1029/2010GL044633. . Next to the Sahara, an equally important source of dust is Central Asia from where dust is transported over East Asia to the adjacent Pacific Ocean. In Asia the problem of dust in the atmosphere is much more severe than in other areas of the world, as dust often is mixed with urban haze. Scientific knowledge on the mixing state of dust with anthropogenic pollution is very limited. Satellite passive remote sensing for instance neither can separate the mixing state of urban haze from desert dust nor can it be used for an accurate positioning of mineral dust relative to another pollution layers or cloud layers. In section 2 we describe the methodology. In section 3 we present a measurement example. We close our contribution in section 4 with a summary. We measured the profile of the linear volume particle plus molecule depolarization ratio. It is defined as the ratio of the lidar signal perpendicularly polarized to the signal that is polarized parallel with respect to the polarization of the transmitted laser beam. The linear particle depolarization ratio follows according to the methods described by  From the backscatter and extinction coefficients we derive particle extinction-to-backscatter lidar ratios at 355 and 532 nm, the extinction-related Ångström exponents for the wavelength pair of 355/532 nm and the backscatter-related Ångström exponents for the wavelength pair of 355/532 nm and 532/1064 nm. In this contribution, we could not determine the backscatter-related Ångström exponents for the wavelength pair of 355/532 nm, because of detector problems of the channel that measures the elastic backscatter signals at 355 nm.  Figure 1 shows the time series of particle optical depth and particle Ångström exponents measured on 31 March and 1 April 2009 with the AERONET Sun photometer that is operated at GIST. Optical depth varied between 0.5–1 at 500 nm and 0.6–1.6 at 380 nm.

The measurement time was from 02:44–04:12 local time on 1 April. The data represent the conditions on 31 March and 1 April 2009.. The backscatter-related Ångström exponent wavelength pair 532/1064 nm varies around 1.5 in the center of the mixed pollution plume below 1.2 km height , and it increases to around 2 above that height range. Our retrievals are affected by large uncertainties. If we compare these numbers to results for pure mineral dust we find again that our values are larger. For pure mineral dust the backscatter-related Ångström exponent varies around 0.5.Profiles of a the particle backscatter coefficients at 532 thick and 1064 nm thin , b the particle extinction coefficients at 355 thick and 532 nm thin , c the particle lidar ratio at 532 nm, d the extinction-related Ångström exponents for the wavelength pair 355/532 nm thick and the backscatter-related Ångström exponent for the wavelength pair 532/1064 nm thin , and e the linear volume molecules + particles depolarization ratio at 532 nm.

Mineral dust was transported from the Gobi desert in heights below 1–1.5 km. Along that track the dust plume passed over urbanized areas like Beijing in China and Seoul in Korea, which makes it highly likely that urban haze was mixed into the dust. Above around 1.5 km height there was little contribution from mineral dust in the pollution plume. The integrated particle extinction profiles result in an optical depth of 0.75 at 532 and 0.98 at 355 nm. We computed optical depth from surface to 700 m altitude on the basis of the extinction value at 700 m and assuming that extinction is constant down to the ground. This assumption likely gives us only a lower limit of optical depth. measured 43 sr ± 1 sr at 532 nm for mineral dust plumes observed over Japan.  The linear volume depolarization ratio varies around 5–8%. The elevated depolarization ratios indicate the presence of depolarizing mineral dust particles. The absolute values, however, may be incorrect. Our system still suffers from calibration uncertainties. The Raman quartz-backscatter-related Ångström exponent describes the wavelength dependence of the Raman scattering cross section of quartz. The mean profile varies around 3.5 in the dust plume. The uncertainty bars are rather high because of the comparably low intensity of the Raman quartz backscatter signals. and by accounting for the . We will be able to investigate East Asian haze layers in a more refined way than what is currently possible with multiwavelength Raman lidar."
114,dust aerosol ocean,"Fertilizing the Amazon and equatorial Atlantic with West African dust. Atmospheric mineral dust plays a vital role in Earth's climate and biogeochemical cycles. The Bodele Depression in Chad has been identified as the single biggest source of atmospheric mineral dust on Earth. Dust eroded from the Bodele is blown across the Atlantic Ocean towards South America. The mineral dust contains micronutrients such as Fe and P that have the potential to act as a fertilizer, increasing primary productivity in the Amazon rain forest as well as the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, and thus leading to N-2 fixation and CO2 drawdown. We present the results of chemical analysis of 28 dust samples collected from the source area, which indicate that up to 6.5 Tg of Fe and 0.12 Tg of P are exported from the Bodele Depression every year. This suggests that the Bodele may be a more significant micronutrient supplier than previously proposed. Citation: Bristow, C. S., K. A. Hudson-Edwards, and A.

These micronutrients are required for the growth of oceanic phytoplankton and terrestrial ecosystems; processes that lead to N 2 fixation and CO 2 sequestration. The Bodélé Depression, which lies within the southern Sahara in Chad, has been identified as the world's largest single source of atmospheric mineral dust, and has been proposed as a potential tipping element in the radiative budget of Earth's atmosphere and biogeochemical cycles.. The sediments of the Bodélé depression include lake bed deposits, shoreline sediments with beach ridges and a delta, as well as some fluvial and Aeolian sediments. The most outstanding feature is around 24,000 km 2 of diatomite rich sediments which have a high albedo and stand out on satellite images. These sediments, which accumulated on the bed of palaeolake Megachad, are primarily authigenic, having been formed within the lake, and are not the product of previous cycles of weathering, erosion, transport and deposition as has been implied in some reports. The bulk of the sediments are diatom frustules which are essentially hollow tubes of biogenic silica, giving the sediments a very low bulk density around 0.8 g cm −2 . The diatom frustules are weakly cemented with authigenic calcite, Mg-calcite, aragonite and gypsum cements Figure S1 of the auxiliary material . The poorly cemented sediments are friable and readily eroded with at least 4 m of sediment eroded locally by the wind since the lake dried out around 1000 years ago. The authigenic minerals and detrital clay minerals including kaolinite contribute to the geochemistry.. Satellite data indicate that the dust-emission peaks during the winter months between December and March. During this time of year, the northeasterly winds transport dust southwest from the Bodélé across the Sahel towards a more equatorial latitude where the dust plume turns west across the Atlantic towards the Amazon Figure 1c . The transport of dust from the Bodélé Depression across the Atlantic to the Amazon takes around 10 days and dust emissions from the Bodélé are associated with an order of magnitude increase in atmospheric dust over the Amazon Basin although not all dust episodes reach the Amazon. During the summer months when there is less dust emission from the Bodélé, the transport path from the Bodélé is towards the west over West Africa in the core of the African Easterly Jet. Sediment eroded from the Bodélé at this time of year augments the other summer dust sources from the western Sahara. a Map of Africa with inset box b showing extent of palaeolake Megachad, Lake Chad, and the Bodélé Depression, c path of dust from Chad across the Atlantic to South America during the winter months modified from , collection of emitted dust samples, as well as field studies of deflation and the source sediments within the Bodélé.

Our estimates are up to 38 times greater than this, suggesting that Bodélé dust may be a much more significant nutrient supplier to the Amazon that previously thought. Our data do, however, support the findings of  In the tropical North Atlantic, nitrogen fixation is co-limited by Fe and P, but is stimulated by the addition of Saharan dusts that supply these elements. , then this represents 78.4 ± 22 Tg of dust and, using our range of Fe and P Bodélé dust concentrations, 2.3 to 5 Tg of Fe and 0.033 to 0.094 Tg of P deposited in the equatorial Atlantic annually. For Fe, this represents 30 to 83% of the 6.0 to 7.7 Tg of Fe calculated to be deposited in the North Atlantic annually. Of this, however, only c . 2% 0.046 to 0.1 Tg Fe is likely to be soluble in ocean water and thus bioavailable although solubility of iron varies considerably from 0.1 to 80%.. The solubility of iron in dust is influenced by a variety of factors, the mineralogy of the dust and subsequent processing within the atmosphere. Atmospheric processing appears to increase the solubility of iron. Fine mode aerosols show larger iron solubilities than coarse mode aerosols, and physical concentration of fine modes during long distance transport will occur as coarse particles are preferentially removed by gravitational settling. In addition, solubility may also be increased by chemical reactions within the atmosphere. Furthermore, the increased surface area to volume ratio of fine particles relative to coarser particles may increase chemical processing and further enhance iron solubility. All of the above factors will also likely affect phosphorus bioavailability. Additional analysis of the composition, size and solubility of iron and phosphorus minerals is required in order to determine the efficacy of the African dust as a fertilizer."

When this ash layer, originating from the Eyjafjoll eruptions in southern Iceland, crossed Leipzig between 2.5 and 6 km height on 16 April 2010, the total 500 nm aerosol optical depth reached 1.0, and the ash-related optical depth was about 0.7.

The Leipzig AERONET Sun photometer measures the particle optical depth from 340–1640 nm, and performs sky radiance observations at 380, 500, 870, and 1020 nm. The uncertainty in the retrieved optical depths is on the order of 0.0005–0.003. In Figures 1a and 2 the Leipzig AERONET photometer observations are shown. The 500 nm aerosol optical depth is 1.0 between 1300 and 1400 UTC. The fine–mode particle optical depth of 0.3 is comparable to the lidar–derived boundary–layer particle optical depth of about 0.35 at 532 nm estimated from the 532 nm backscatter coefficient which is reliable down to low heights . The coarse–mode–related optical depth of 0.7 at 500 nm in Figure 2 can be interpreted as the ash–related optical depth. This is also in good agreement with the lidar observations. The 532 nm optical depth in the free troposphere decreased from values around 0.65 1330 UTC and 0.3–0.4 1500–1600 UTC to values around 0.05 after 1800 UTC.AERONET Sun photometer observations Leipzig, 16 April 2010, http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/ of top 500 nm aerosol optical depth level 1.0 data and bottom Ångström exponents AE computed from the optical depths measured at 380, 500, and 1640 nm.

This also supports the hypothesis that a considerable amount of rather large ash particles was still present in these ash plumes after a travel of 1–2 days, and dominated the observed optical properties.

120,dust atmosphere,"Geographical distribution and sources of phosphorus in atmospheric aerosol over the North Pacific Ocean. Atmospheric aerosol samples with two size fractions D-a <= 2.5 mu m and D-a >= 2.5 mu m were collected in the subtropical region of the western North Pacific WNP and over the central North Pacific CNP Ocean in summer and geographical distributions of particulate concentrations of total phosphorus TP , water soluble fraction of phosphorus, and tracer elements Fe, Zn, Na were investigated. Average concentrations in ng m -3 of TP, Fe, Zn, Na in the WNP region were 7.3 +/- 4.3, 16.2 +/- 17.1, 5.5 +/- 7.5, and 1450 +/- 700, while they were 2.5 +/- 1.2, 5.9 +/- 5.1, 0.9 +/- 1.2, and 1480 +/- 610 along the 160 degrees W line in the CNP, respectively. Source apportionment using the tracer elements exhibited that contribution of anthropogenic source was estimated to be 38% and 18%, while that of crustal source was estimated to be about 5% for both WNP and CNP regions, respectively. Oceanic source was estimated to have a little contribution. Half or less fraction of the TP could be accounted for by the anthropogenic and crustal sources. Water solubility of the TP was found to be higher in the WNP region than the CNP region. The similar fractions of water soluble and anthropogenic contribution to the TP found in both WNP and CNP regions suggested that anthropogenic phosphorus was water soluble and dominant in the WNP region, although the unaccounted fraction occupied a large portion of the TP 47% and 76% for WNP and CNP, respectively as insoluble form.

Lett., 37, L03805, doi: 10.1029/2009GL041367. . Recent observations show that bioavailability of the phosphorus actually limits primary production and abundance of bacteria. Since atmospheric phosphorus mainly resides in aerosol phase, characteristics of aerosol-phase phosphorus, such as concentration range, size distribution, geographical distribution, emission sources, source strengthen, atmospheric transformation, are essential to estimate the impact of atmospheric input of the phosphorus to the ocean ecosystem. However, phosphorus composition in the atmospheric aerosols has been poorly characterized. The North Pacific Ocean is one of the least characterized regions about the aerosol-phase phosphorus. Although several land-based measurements have been carried out in the North Pacific Rim region, there is no measurement in the open ocean region after the pioneer work in the late 1970s. In Figure 1a , geographical distributions of total aerosol-phase phosphorus TP , iron Fe , zinc Zn , and sodium Na are shown. The height of each bar represents aerosol-phase elemental concentration in each 12 hours sampling period. Fe, Zn, and Na are selected for analysis to conduct a source apportionment analysis for TP since these elements generally represent different aerosol sources Fe: crustal, Zn: anthropogenic, Na: oceanic . The TP concentration found to be higher in the WNP region than the CNP region by a factor of three Table 1 . But the high TP concentration in the WNP region rapidly declined as being away from the land. This suggests that there is a large terrestrial P source s on the land which is more locally effective to the composition of atmospheric aerosol. In the open ocean, TP concentration was low and less variable except for several points in the vicinity of the Hawaii and Japanese islands. Similar geographical distributions were also observed for Zn and Fe. Since Zn and Fe are the tracers for anthropogenic and crustal aerosol source, respectively, the similar trends indicate a larger contribution of anthropogenic and crustal sources to the TP in this region from the Asian continent. Sodium concentration varied regardless of distance from the land, reflecting, while the composition measured at Jeju Island in Korea reflected both anthropogenic and crustal source emissions in the Asian continent since Jeju Island is located downstream of Asian outflow and the observation covered the period of dust outflow events. The open ocean region was divided into three transects 1 the tropical and sub-tropical North Pacific, 2 along the 160°W Line in the central North Pacific, and 3 the northern North Pacific as depicted with different colors in the ship track. As already shown in Figure 1a , TP, Fe, and Zn concentrations were relatively constant in the all three transects of the North Pacific. Therefore, we will further focus on the comparison between the western North Pacific region and the central North Pacific region along the 160°W line.. Although our “average” TP concentration in the WNP was about one third of the TP observed in Taiwan, similar high TP concentrations 14 ∼ 22 ng m −3 were also observed over the proximity of the lands or islands during this study. We thus consider that this study well represented a regional mean with little local influence over the WNP region during summer. In the CNP region, the only previous TP measurement was the work by pointed out that the modeled TP in the remote North Pacific Ocean was significantly overestimated compared to the observation by Graham and Duce. The TP concentrations observed in this study were in the range of the modeled TP concentrations. The discrepancy may be simply due to the fact of variable nature of atmospheric aerosol concentration in time, space, and season, however, it should be noted that the TP concentration reported by Graham and Duce , the measured geographical distribution of the TP high concentration in the closer vicinity of the East Asia and sharp decrease as being away from the land showed a qualitatively similar trend. The measured TP concentrations in the mid-latitude and close to the land were also within the range of the modeled ones. However, there is a large discrepancy around the equatorial zone: Modeled TP was about one order of magnitude lower than the measured concentration in this study. One should keep in mind that current observations were conducted in June, August and September, while the modeled concentration is an annual average.. For the P/Zn anthro , since there is no established P/Zn value for anthropogenic P source, we calculated the P/Zn anthro using mass concentrations measured in Hong Kong Table 1 . Although aerosol composition in Hong Kong mainly reflects emission from anthropogenic P sources, continental dust and/or biomass burning sources may also contribute to the observed TP to some extent. For the P/Na oceanic , we took a conservative total phosphorus concentration in the bulk surface seawater 2.8 μ M, see auxiliary material for details , although phosphate concentration varies more than one order of magnitude in the region of this study.. Taking this enrichment into account, the oceanic source may considerably contribute to the TP particularly in the Northern North Pacific Ocean where TP concentration in seawater is high. But this oceanic TP will not supply “new” phosphorus as nutrient to the ocean when the aerosols are deposited to the ocean since the oceanic TP is a recycled component. It may be possible that long-range transport of phosphorus-rich sea salt aerosol may bring phosphorus to the ocean with low phosphorus concentration, however, it is unlikely since the sea salt aerosol has its most of the mass in the coarse fraction as shown in Figure S1 and thus have shorter atmospheric lifetime and transportation distance.. In the model study, various P emission sources, such as crustal, biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion, biofuel combustion, volcano, primary biogenic particle, and ocean, were considered. The model study suggested that crustal source contributed to 50 ∼ 90% of the TP over the North Pacific Ocean except for the equatorial region and the coastal region of Asia, while anthropogenic sources assume 90% of biomass burning is also anthropogenic contributed only up to 30% even in the close vicinity of the Asian continent and over the North Pacific, which is quite different from the estimate in this study. One possible reason is the large seasonal variation of Asian outflow and dust events during spring. Present study did not cover the season with frequent Asian outflow and dust event, which may be, at least in part, the reason for the observed small contribution of continental crustal source. However, the large seasonal variation still does not explain the large unaccounted portion of the TP. The P/Fe crustal varies for different source soils of Asian dust by −35 ∼ +30% relative to the value used in this study see auxiliary material , although this only increases the estimated crustal contribution from 5% to 6.5%. In the current source apportionment study, biomass burning, volcanic emission, and primary biogenic aerosol are not considered as phosphorus sources. We consider that volcanic emission and primary biogenic aerosol sources are unlikely as the unaccounted portion. Volcanic emission is usually a point emission source, thus it should create a large geographical gradient in TP. However, our results show relatively constant TP concentration over the North Pacific Ocean. As for the primary biogenic aerosol emission, this terrestrial emission should be localized near the land and have little contribution to the TP in the remote open ocean region like CNP region in this study. The primary biogenic aerosol is quite unlikely as an explanation for the unaccounted portion. Currently, we consider biomass burning may be one of the unaccounted sources. As already mentioned, the unaccounted fraction had more fine fraction than the coarse one. Such larger fine fraction of TP in biomass burning aerosols over coarse fraction has been reported in the biomass burning aerosols in Brazil. Further detailed study to estimate the contribution of biomass burning source by referring black carbon concentration or non-sea salt potassium is required. Gas phase phosphorus like PH 3 , which is primary gaseous phosphorus, may contribute to the aerosol-phase TP through its uptake and nucleation. It has been reported that PH 3 concentration was quite high 200 ∼ 1000 ng m −3 in the coastal area compared to the aerosol-phase TP, however, the concentration sharply declined to zero as being away from coastal area. It is unlikely that the PH 3 gas actually contributes to the present unaccounted portion of the TP, particularly in the open ocean region like CNP region.. Appling the average fractions of the WSP to the average TP concentrations in the WNP and CNP regions Table 1 , mass concentrations of the WSP were estimated to be 0.4 and 3.0 ng m −3 for the WNP and CNP, respectively. Figures 1b and 1c show the accounts for the average TP based on source apportionment and water solubility for the WNP and CNP regions. Interestingly, water soluble fractions well agreed with those of anthropogenic fraction in both the WNP and CNP regions. This suggests that anthropogenic fraction of the TP is more water soluble than the TP from other sources and the increased WSP in the coastal region was due to the increased contribution of anthropogenic phosphorus source. “Others” mainly consists of insoluble compositions which are expected to exist rather uniformly both in the coastal and open ocean regions. The geographical distribution of WSP fraction in the North Pacific Figure S2 also supports the large contribution of anthropogenic phosphorus source in the WNP region. The WSP fraction decreased as being away from the dust source region Asian continent in the North Pacific, while it increased as being away from the Saharan desert in the Atlantic Ocean, where Saharan dust is dominant particulate phosphorus source. This clear contrast also suggests that different types of particulate phosphorus sources are dominant in the Atlantic Ocean and the North Pacific. Source apportionment using the tracer species Fe, Zn, Fe as representatives of crustal, anthropogenic, and seawater sources could account for only half or less fraction of the TP. The contribution of crustal source was relatively small although a model study suggested that crustal source was the dominant contributor to the aerosol-phase TP in this region. The similar fractions of water soluble and anthropogenic contribution in both WNP and CNP regions suggest that anthropogenic phosphorus is more water soluble and contributed to the increase of water soluble fraction in the WNP region.. Further detailed observations with different season and region are desired to understand the behavior and sources of the atmospheric aerosol-phase phosphorus in the Pacific Ocean."
117,dust particles,"Importance of adsorption for CCN activity and hygroscopic properties of mineral dust aerosol. This study uses published data on dust-water interactions to examine the importance of including water adsorption effects when describing the hygroscopic and cloud condensation nuclei CCN behavior of mineral dust aerosol. Adsorption activation theory AT better represents fresh dust-water interactions than Kohler theory KT , as i a consistent set of adsorption parameters can describe the hygroscopic behavior of dust under both sub and supersaturated conditions , and ii the dependence of critical supersaturation, s c , with particle dry diameter, D dry , is closer to observations. The long adsorption timescale could also contribute to the large differences observed between dry and wet generated dust hygroscopicity. If KT and AT are consistently applied to the same dust size distribution, KT predicts up to tenfold higher CCN and 40% higher droplet number concentration than AT. This profoundly different behavior between the theories suggests that both may be required for a comprehensive description of atmospheric dust CCN activity. Citation: Kumar, P., A. Nenes, and I. N. Sokolik 2009 , Importance of adsorption for CCN activity and hygroscopic properties of mineral dust aerosol, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L24804, doi:10.1029/2009GL040827. , or ice nuclei IN affecting cloud microphysics, albedo, and lifetime. Despite its well-recognized importance, assessments of dust impacts on clouds and climate are highly uncertain. In this study, we address the role of dust as CCN with the goal to provide an improved representation of dust CCN activation in the climate models., which is based solely on the contribution of the solute and curvature effects upon water equilibrium vapor pressure. KT implies that dust particles devoid of any solute would require very high ambient supersaturations dictated by the Kelvin equation to act as CCN. It is well known however that adsorption of water on insoluble particles especially clays can lead to hygroscopic growth similar to deliquescent salts. Past studies have demonstrated that calcite CaCO 3 a mineral with very low solubility compared to deliquescent salts and Arizona Test Dust ATD can interact with water vapor and adsorb multiple layers of water under subsaturated conditions. This interaction implies that dust mixtures and individual minerals with hydrophilic insoluble surfaces can affect water activity of aerosol especially when the solute fraction of particles is low with largely ignored implications for predicted CCN activity. . Competition for water vapor in a cloud parcel during activation of KT particles can thus be more intense than for FHH-AT particles, leading to a different parcel maximum supersaturation, and and and , but not for dry ATD and SD. The large scatter R 2 < 0.7 for the  The long equilibration time minutes or more associated with adsorption may explain why the hygroscopicity of dry and wet generated dust are so different. The residence time of dust particles in the instrumentation is typically less than a minute, limiting the amount of water that can adsorb and bias the observed hygroscopicity below its equilibrium value. Wetting the dust particles prior to measurement would maximize the amount of adsorbed water and express the full extent of its hygroscopicity. One approach to modeling this system is using one value for In this section, differences in predicted CCN concentrations and droplet number concentrations from application of KT and FHH-AT are estimated. For this, we use a single-mode lognormal aerosol obtained from in-situ measurements of SD during the NAMMA field campaign with geometric mean diameter, The larger CCN concentrations at a given supersaturation associated with use of KT suggests that the calculated droplet number, compared to using FHH-AT, will be larger. KT however requires more water to activate particles than FHH-AT, so the competition for water vapor in the former particles is stronger, potentially impacting  Figure 2b shows the ratio of total CCN that activate to cloud droplets using KT, N d κ , to that from FHH-AT, N d FHH , as a function of parcel updraft velocity symbols for four different dust types. The corresponding parcel s max is also shown solid lines . For wet CID and wet ATD, is largest ∼1.3–1.4 at w ∼ 0.1 ms −1 and approaches 1.0 for w > 1 ms −1 . This is because the parcel s max < 1% for all w < 1 ms −1 Figure 2b , where > 1 Figure 2a and droplet differences are dominated by the larger activation fractions associated with KT. Similarly, > 1 for dry ATD and SD and w < 1 ms −1 . However, for w > 1 ms −1 , the competition of water vapor from KT particles is sufficiently strong so that < 1. At very high updrafts >3 ms −1 , all particles activate, and → 1.[17]  In this study, we compared Köhler theory KT against FHH adsorption activation theory FHH-AT when applied to the activation of mineral dust aerosol. Based on published data, a number of potential issues were found with KT, suggesting it may not fully represent CCN activity of mineral dust aerosol, since i a consistent set of FHH-AT adsorption parameters can be found that describe both the subsaturated hygroscopic growth and CCN activity, and, ii the critical supersaturation vs dry diameter exponents determined for FHH-AT are often closer to observations, than those from KT. Application of KT and FHH-AT leads to the differences in predicted CCN and cloud droplet number concentrations, even if consistent hygroscopicity and adsorption parameters i.e., derived from the same experimental data are used. For the dust samples considered here, CCN concentrations can differ by a factor of 10, and results in a 40% difference in predicted cloud droplet number concentration. Thus, a comprehensive description of CCN activity of mineral dust aerosol throughout its atmospheric lifetime may require a combination of both KT and FHH-AT."
115,particles dust,"Relative humidity dependence of light absorption by mineral dust after long-range atmospheric transport from the Sahara. The relative humidity RH dependence of light absorption for a Saharan dust-dominated air mass transported to the Gulf of Mexico was measured during the 2006 TexAQS/GoMACCS study using a photo-acoustic absorption spectrometer PAS . Aerosol absorption was measured at low 25% and high 73% RH indicating a 1.5 +/-0.3 absorption enhancement [f RHAbs ] under high RH conditions. f RHAbs estimates, based on air-mass physical and optical properties and Mie theory modeling, were between 1.2-1.4. Reasons for differences between the measured and modeled f RHAbs are discussed. The mass absorption coefficient of the long-range transported dust was calculated to be 0.04 +/-0.02 m 2 g -1 . Citation: Lack, D. A., et al. 2009 , Relative humidity dependence of light absorption by mineral dust after long-range atmospheric transport from the Sahara, Geophys. Res.

While f RH Sca is relatively well understood from theoretical, laboratory and field investigations, quantification of f RH on particle light absorption. Light absorption can be enhanced as a particle is coated in a scattering layer that focuses the radiation onto the core. . Ambient measurement of f RH Abs using the difference of extinction and scattering is prohibited by the uncertainties of the derived absorption. contributes a substantial climate influence from globally averaged cooling to altered precipitation patterns. Saharan dust is an extensively studied dust source, can absorb 1 to 10% of the radiation it encounters i.e. single scattering albedo SSA of ∼0.90 at mid visible wavelengths and has variable wavelength absorption. The size and optical properties of lofted dust can change as transport occurs; e.g. the SSA can increase and chemical composition change as it becomes internally mixed with hygroscopic materials such as sulfate, sea salt and ammonium nitrate. Oxidation of SO 2 to sulfate on dust particles also occurs. Up to 80% of transported dust can be internally mixed with other material and suspension of hygroscopic dust into the atmosphere can occur. The f RH Sca and size growth due to RH changes, g RH SCA of mineral dust aerosol have been measured to be between 1.1 and 1.7, with lower values usually corresponding to dust measured close to the source region.  Chemical, optical and physical properties of ≤10 concluded that RH-induced scattering changes within mixed dust/pollution aerosol would be negligible due to the dominance of external mixing i.e., interaction of dust and pollution would be minimal and a cancellation of scattering due to redistribution of hygroscopic material from the fine to coarse modes when internal mixing occurred. Those studies did not consider an f RH Abs effect. To gain an insight to this the impact of RH on the SSA of the dust-dominated particles studied, we incorporated the f RH Abs effect into Mie theory. Figure 3b shows that the SSA expected for humidified dust-dominated aerosol with the f RH Abs effect can be reduced from 0.01–0.03 compared to the SSA when f RH Abs is not considered. This reduction is for reasonable growth conditions and does not consider optical changes due to redistribution of externally mixed material, which will complicate the impact of the f RH Abs effect. This result is for long-range transported, well-aged dust and likely represents the end of a continuum beginning at the dust source i.e., these results may not be as significant for less aged dust .[10]  Photo-acoustic absorption spectroscopy was used in the field to measure an absorption enhancement from water uptake [f RH Abs ] of 1.5 ±0.3 RH ∼73% for Saharan dust-dominated aerosol. Simulations of the f RH Abs for the aerosol encountered showed f RH Abs of 1.2–1.4 is possible given assumed particle properties and that SSA can be reduced by 0.01–0.03. A small amount of strongly absorbing EC, or more absorbing dust mixed with non-absorbing quartz rather than uniformly mixed absorbing dust may resolve the difference in modeled and observed f RH Abs . The observed f RH Abs shows that PAS is capable of measuring an f RH Abs signal and that dust aerosol can exhibit f RH Abs due to water uptake by internally mixed hygroscopic material. It is recognized that this analysis is based on a small subset of data however the unique insights gained show cause for further investigation."
109,aerosol,"From solar radiation measurements to optical properties: 1998-2008 trends in Japan. Trends from April 1998 to March 2008 in surface global irradiance, aerosol surface direct radiative forcing, and aerosol optical properties optical thickness, single scattering albedo, and asymmetry factor were investigated based on measurements of the surface solar radiation under clear skies at Tsukuba, Japan. The optical properties were estimated by optimizing the external mixture of four assumed aerosols water soluble, soot, sea salt, and dust to the surface direct and diffuse irradiances in visible and near infrared regions. The surface global irradiance was increased by an increase of single scattering albedo, not by a decrease of optical thickness. Furthermore, the increasing trend of single scattering albedo may be related to the reduced emission of black carbon in East Asia. Citation: Kudo, R., A. Uchiyama, A. Yamazaki, T. Sakami, and E. Kobayashi 2010 , From solar radiation measurements to optical properties: 1998-2008 trends in Japan, Geophys. Res. Lett., 37, L04805, doi:10.1029/2009GL041794. . The surface solar radiation at widespread locations decreased until the mid 1980s global dimming . After this decline, the trend reversed to increasing global brightening . The transition from dimming to brightening extremely affects global warming. Since the transition is seen under both cloudy and clear skies at numerous locations, the change in the aerosol property is considered one of the dominant contributors to the transition.. In this study, BAOT in VIS and NIR are defined as follows: where Four AOTC are optimized by minimizing the sum of the square differences between measured and estimated BAOT and DDR in VIS and NIR. We employed Levenberg-Marquardt method of  Considering only the aerosol radiative effect, the daily means of surface global, direct, and diffuse irradiances in TTL, VIS, and NIR under clear skies were estimated from the measurements. The cloud screening and the calculations of the daily means were conducted by the method of  Trends of the global irradiances in TTL, VIS, and NIR under all skies were also estimated see Table 2 . Here, all skies mean the skies without rainy conditions. We omitted the rainy days, because drops sometimes remain on the top of the glass dome of the pyranometer after the rain. The trends were 9.9 Wm −2 /decade TTL , 6.8 Wm −2 /decade VIS , and 2.7 Wm −2 /decade NIR . The global irradiances in Japan began increasing in the early 1990s. The averaged increase magnitude is about 10 Wm −2 in 1990–2005. Our results are in line with these results.  Figure 3c presents the monthly means of the daily mean AOT, SSA, and ASM at 525 nm. AOT is seen to decrease slightly, but SSA clearly increases. The trends were −0.01/decade for AOT, 0.10/decade for SSA, and 0.02/decade for ASM. The positive/negative sign of the trend of AOT was not clear due to the large variation, but the trends of SSA and ASM were certainly positive. In particular, the increase of SSA was very large. Therefore, the aerosol surface radiative forcing was reduced by the increase of SSA. This can explain that the direct irradiance has no apparent trend and the diffuse irradiance has an increase trend. It is concluded that the recent increase of the global irradiance under clear skies at Tsukuba was caused by the increase of SSA, not by the decrease of AOT. This demonstrates that the long-term change of SSA can play an important role in the long-term change of the surface solar radiation.. BC emission in East Asia decreased gradually from the 1990s, because of the decline of coal use in urban areas. In addition, SSA calculated from SO 2 and BC emissions has increased since 1980s in China. [2007] suggests that the change of SSA can partly explain the transitions of the global and diffuse irradiances measured in China. Our results are consistent with the trend of BC emission. The recent brightening at Tsukuba can therefore likely be attributed to reduced BC emission due to air pollution control.[18]  Our observed surface solar radiation under clear skies at Tsukuba increased from 1998 to 2008 due to a decrease of aerosol surface radiative forcing. The aerosol surface radiative forcing was reduced by an increase of SSA, not by a decrease of AOT. Furthermore, the increasing trend of SSA may be related to the reduced BC emission in East Asia. There have been many investigations of the long-term changes of AOT at many sites around the world, but there are not many studies of the long-term change of SSA. For understanding the change of the surface solar radiation, we need to investigate the changes of both AOT and SSA."
366,dust climate aerosol,"Descending particles: From the atmosphere to the deep ocean-A time series study in the subtropical NE Atlantic. The transport ways of organic matter into the deep ocean are still under debate. Lithogenic particles deliver nutrients to the surface, boost biological production, and impact on carbon export. This study focuses on the transfer of lithogenic particles from the atmosphere to the deep ocean and its physical and biological interactions during their descent through the water column. A clear coupling between atmospheric dust occurrence and deepsea lithogenic particle fluxes at 2000 m depth was observed in the subtropical NE Atlantic 33 degrees N, 22 degrees W . This has never been demonstrated before for this site, far away from the African continental slope and with no lateral influx of particles present. The atmospheric signal transmission to the deep ocean lies in the range of one to two months. The presented data demonstrate the dependence of lithogenic deep-sea fluxes on the positioning in the ocean and on particle residence times in the water column. Citation: Brust, J., D. E.

Climate change scenarios predict spreading of desert areas, increasing wind strength and enhanced mineral aerosol production which is also relevant for oceanic primary production as aerosols carry essential nutrients to the ocean e.g., phosphorous, nitrogen, iron . Fertilization and ballasting are the major effects eolian mineral detritus have on ocean biogeochemistry and particle flux. Hence, mineral aerosols deposited in the ocean indirectly affect the carbon export. However, the fate of particles that descend from the atmosphere to the deep ocean is still under debate. and decoupling of the signals was reported. Comparative studies of dust concentrations and marine sediment fluxes were carried out at different sites off NW/W Africa, which were additionally influenced by lateral advection of continental slope/shelf material. Yet those studies showed a close relation between the atmospheric dust and the marine lithogenic flux signal.. Sampling intervals ranged from 5 to 62 days, between February 2002 to March 2005. The fraction of lithogenic material was determined by an automated particle analysis via scanning electron microscopy coupled with an electron dispersive X-ray system SEM-EDX see auxiliary material for further information . a Position of the sampling site in the subtropical NE Atlantic. The grey box covers the area of averaged AOD data, based on the catchment area of a sediment trap deployed at 2000 m depth. b Lithogenic particle flux black bars versus GOCART dust aerosol optical thickness red line , area averaged based on the catchment area. c Moving averages 3 data points for lithogenic flux black line time series and GOCART AOD time series red line , based on monthly values.. Satellite derived AODs – such as the MODIS AODs of the Terra and Aqua satellites used here – comprise sea salt aerosols, sulphur aerosols, carbonaceous aerosols, and the mineral dust component. Since only mineral dust accounts for the lithogenic particle flux of the sediment traps, we have additionally chosen the simulated dust AODs AOD and residence times of dust-derived iron of 6–62 days., interaction with organic compounds and biology, and moreover the manner and time required for particle aggregate formation. Particles are displaced by surface currents while remaining in the upper water layer. Mean near surface currents in SE direction are low <5 cm s −1 at Kiel 276. Below the mixed layer depth ∼50 to 200 m , particles start sinking but are less exposed to current-controlled displacements. Settling speeds are in the order of 100 m d −1 . Assuming a direct descent of particles from ocean surface to 2000 m depth, particles would reach the trap in 20 days. Still, settling velocities can also vary below the mixed layer due to scavenging and release through organic matter decomposition. Decreased settling velocities and/or longer routes of transport increase the time the particle needs to reach the trap position, e.g., particles from 280 km afar need around 65 days presuming current velocities of 5 cm s −1 to reach the sampling site. This is slightly longer than the lag of 1.5 to 2 months visible between AODs and lithogenic particle flux and might be one explanation for the deviation from a better correlation.. The assumed settling velocity of 100 m d −1 points towards short residence times in surface waters from 25 to 40 days.. Primary production peaks during winter/early spring when nutrients from deeper water layers are resupplied by deepening of the mixed layer ≃200 m Figure 2a . Typically, the biogenic particle flux follows the satellite chlorophyll-a signal within one month, expressed both in an increase of surface water chlorophyll-a between December and March and by high biogenic particle fluxes occurring between March and April see Figure 2b . A dust event during winter/early spring increases nutrient concentrations and may increase primary production Figure 2a . During summer, the nutrients are depleted in the shallow mixed layer ≤50 m compared to winter, leading to low primary production during these months. Therefore, a clear impact of atmospheric dust input on the primary production should be expected in summer: nutrient limitation is relieved by mineral dust input and associated bioavailable compounds which would support biologic production with a delay of days to weeks Figure 2a . a Scenarios of dust deposition during left winter and right summer and its possible effects on primary production. b Area averaged data of 8-day mean SeaWiFS chlorophyll-a values shown together with biogenic particle flux from the 2000 m sediment trap. The biogenic particle flux was determined by SEM-EDX automated particle analysis and encompasses biogenic mineral phases e.g., calcite, opal, barite . Red bars indicate dust events determined by an aerosol optical depth AOD threshold of mean AOD plus standard deviation for MODIS and GOCART AOD data in comparison with satellite views. Dust events last 2 to 5 days, shown bars mark the first day of a dust event over the sampling site. However, a dust-derived enhancement of biological production during winter/early spring could be masked by the natural variability of primary production intensity in this region Figure 2b . Summer dust events have a strong impact on the amount of lithogenic particles collected at depth, but do not affect surface chlorophyll-a concentrations Figure 2 and thus primary production. Effects can be masked by the deep chlorophyll maximum at 120 m depth present in this part of the Atlantic and not registered by satellite sensors. [2004] infer potential fertilization via aerosols during summer months in the Canary Island region, based on aerosol samples, water column and sediment trap measurements. In summer 2004, when dust events occurred in July and August, the flux of biogenic particles was also elevated Figure 2 without an increase of surface chlorophyll-a concentrations as based on satellite images. This hints to an effect missed by satellite observations. For a better understanding of these processes further investigations are needed with longer lasting sediment trap time series and simultaneous satellite aerosol optical data to observe more summer dust events within this region and their impact on primary production."
92,dust aerosol,"On the availability of uncoated mineral dust ice nuclei in cold cloud regions. The ice nucleation efficiency of mineral dust decreases when it acquires coatings, e. g. through processing in liquid clouds. This study explores the availability of unprocessed mineral dust for interactions with clouds. We performed forward trajectory calculations originating near the surface of the Chinese Taklimakan desert. The initial specific humidity of each trajectory was assumed to be conserved and used to calculate the relative humidities with respect to water and ice, allowing us to estimate the formation of liquid, mixed-phase and ice clouds downstream. Practically none of the simulated air parcels reached conditions suitable for homogeneous nucleation of ice T less than or similar to -40 degrees C without experiencing water saturation first. Potentially the biggest impact of mineral dust is predicted to be on mixed-phase clouds. Furthermore, most trajectories passed through ice-saturated but water-subsaturated regions where ""warm"" T greater than or similar to -40 degrees C ice clouds may form prior to mixed-phase clouds. Citation: Wiacek, A., and T. Peter 2009 , On the availability of uncoated mineral dust ice nuclei in cold cloud regions, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L17801, doi:10.1029/2009GL039429. . The biggest uncertainty related to aerosols is the extent of their so-called indirect radiative effect, i.e., how they affect the reflectivity, lifetime, and precipitation of both warm and cold clouds. The important role of mineral dust in the formation of the ice phase has been known for a long time from both observations and lab studies. Recent field measurements confirm that mineral dust is an efficient ice nucleus IN and give evidence of its presence in ice crystal residuals within anvil cirrus.. On the other hand, condensation/immersion and less explored contact freezing are thought to control ice formation at warmer temperatures. The primary goal of our study was to explore the potential availability of mineral dust deposition ice nuclei, i.e., uncoated particles not processed in liquid clouds, for interactions with cirrus clouds. However, we also explored the potential interactions of mineral dust with mixed-phase and water clouds.. The latter is a heterogeneous, arid region, which includes the well known Gobi desert. However, our study focuses on the Taklimakan desert because of its potential relevance to cirrus-forming regions: while Gobi dust is thought to be confined to <3 km altitude 90% of the time, Taklimakan dust is thought to be entrained relatively easily to >5 km, in part due to the complex surrounding topography Figure 1 .Asian dust region topography color bar in meters in T799 ECMWF analyses. The 42 trajectory starting points are shown in magenta. shows that the Tarim basin is dusty in all months of the year except from December to February. As such, the transport trajectories calculated for 2007 are representative of dust-laden air masses in spring the peak of the Asian dust season and, to a large extent, also in summer and fall. Following Figure 2 , each of the ∼1.8 million trajectory points was sorted according to its Lagrangian; however, a large number of events also occurs for higher. This is also the case for a small but non-negligible number of trajectory points but in fact the majority of whole trajectories that are ice-saturated and water-subsaturated, wherein “warm” ice clouds may be able to form prior to mixed-phase cloud formation. Finally, the investigation of potential cloud impacts from other dust emitting regions is the subject of a forthcoming publication."
93,clouds aerosol,"Does dust change the clear sky top of atmosphere shortwave flux over high surface reflectance regions?. Using four stream radiative transfer calculations, satellite-derived aerosol optical thickness at 558 nm and top of atmosphere TOA broadband radiative fluxes we examine the effect of mineral dust aerosols on the clear sky TOA shortwave 0.3-5 mu m fluxes over the Saharan desert [30E-10W, 15N-30N]. Over very bright surfaces surface albedo >35% , the TOA shortwave flux, from both satellite measurements and model calculations, is nearly insensitive to the increase in dust optical thickness. Below this surface albedo value, known as the critical albedo, mineral dust aerosols show scattering effects and above this they show absorbing effects. Therefore, over desert regions with a large range of surface albedo values, scattering and absorbing effects compensate each other thereby making the TOA shortwave aerosol radiative effect rather small. Citation: Patadia, F., E.-S. Yang, and S. A. Christopher 2009 , Does dust change the clear sky top of atmosphere shortwave flux over high surface reflectance regions?, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L15825, doi: 10.1029/2009GL039092. . Nearly 700 Tg of dust aerosols are produced annually in the Saharan desert. Due to the aridity of the desert regions, it is also noted for its high surface reflectance. Satellite remote sensing is the only viable method to obtain information on dust aerosols and their properties at such large spatial scales. A few ground measurements of aerosols exist over North Africa as part of the Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET program but it is limited in terms of spatial sampling. Several field campaigns have also been conducted to examine the role of dust primarily in climate related issues.. Dust aerosols are non-spherical in shape and their size distribution depends on factors such as parent soil type, wind velocity and ageing process. For example, from the Dust and Biomass-burning Experiment DABEX in Sahelian West Africa, . Also, larger dust particles can perturb the longwave radiation balance. did not report the SWDRE for global desert regions due to noisy SWF-AOT relations in these regions. The goal of this paper is to examine whether dust aerosols change the TOA shortwave flux over high reflectance regions such as the Sahara desert under cloud free conditions and whether the SWDRE is significantly underestimated if dust radiative effects over bright regions are neglected. The cloud free TOA shortwave flux will be referred to as shortwave flux SWF . We use aerosol optical thickness AOT at 558 nm to characterize dust loading and broadband shortwave fluxes from satellite measurements to characterize the SWDRE over North Africa 15-30N and 30E-10W; see Figure 1 . We use the AOT estimated from combined Ozone Monitoring Instrument OMI and Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer MISR products that is called estimated AOT EAOT and the SWF from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System CERES product. The relation between AOT and SWF is further examined as a function of broadband surface albedo  A delta-four stream plane-parallel broadband radiative transfer RT model was used to compute shortwave 0.2–4 The SWF also changes with change in solar zenith angle. The RT model simulations show changes in the magnitude of SWF for varying SZAs 5°, 25° and 40° . The change is more pronounced for higher surface albedo 20-40% values as opposed to low surface albedo 5-20% . However all other relations including the critical albedo value remain unchanged for both aerosol types considered here not shown .. From Figures 2a or 2b the SWDRE of dust over deserts can be speculated. As discussed in section 3.1 , for α s < α c , where the scattering effect dominates, the SWDRE at the TOA will be negative. At the critical albedo value 30% < α s < 45% where the SWF is constant for increasing AOT values, the SWDRE will be zero. For α s > α c , the aerosols predominantly absorb incident radiation and will cause positive SWDRE. Thus, depending on the range of surface albedo values, the net SWDRE of mineral dust will be a cancellation of the positive and negative radiative effects making the SWDRE rather small..Relationship of TOA SWDRE of mineral dust and aerosol optical thickness from 4-stream RT model at SZA = 25° and VZA = 0°. Different colors show SWARF as a function of surface albedo. The inset shows the relationship of SWARF and surface albedo.The first column shows the surface albedo values used in the RT model for top of the atmosphere TOA flux calculations. F_clr is the clear sky shortwave flux at TOA and DEFF is the dust radiative forcing efficiency which is the slope of the SWDRE-AOT linear regression line and Y-Intercept its intercept.[14]  The shortwave radiative effect of aerosols is best discernible for low reflectivity backgrounds and highly scattering aerosols. In this study, using satellite data and radiative transfer calculations, we have carefully quantified under what conditions we can see this change in shortwave flux due to changes in aerosol loading as given by AOT over the Sahara desert. This study offers observational evidences for the following statements:[15]  1. The broadband SWDRE is not only dependent upon aerosol properties but is also very sensitive to the surface albedo. If the surface is very bright 35-40% , TOA shortwave fluxes do not respond substantially to an increase in aerosol loading and therefore the SWDRE is negligible.[16]  2. There is a critical surface albedo below above which the scattering absorption effect of dust aerosol dominates. This critical surface albedo is a function of the aerosol properties and surface type. For a mixture of different dust types and for a range of surface albedo values, the negative and positive effects can compensate each other; resulting in small SWDRE values. Satellite observations used in this study can be used to estimate this critical albedo value.[17]  3. While considering the dust radiative effects on climate, it is very crucial to have a proper knowledge of the underlying surface conditions, i.e., the surface albedo range. Over bright regions with scattering aerosols, aerosol concentration and properties show a second order effect.[18]  The major conclusion from this paper is that dust over high reflectance regions offers a scene with low contrast and hence does not enhance the TOA effective albedo substantially. Therefore, the TOA dust SWDRE over these regions will be small. Finally we note that in contrast to our previous studies over ocean where TOA dust SWDRE outweighs LWRE, over land the TOA SWDRE is negligible when compared to the LWRE. Dust also undergoes internal and external mixing with other aerosol species and therefore their radiative effects become important to both regional and global climate. If the sum of SWDRE and LWRE over oceans is negative, it remains to be seen if in a global sense the LWRE of dust over land will balance the SWDRE of dust over oceans."
94,climate aerosol,"Mineral content analysis of atmospheric dust using hyperspectral information from space. The Bodele depression of northern Chad is considered one of the world's largest sources of atmospheric mineral dust. Mineral composition of such transported dust is essential to our understanding of climate forcing, mineralogy of dust sources, aerosol optical properties, and mineral deposition to Amazon forests. In this study we examine hyperspectral information acquired over the Bodele by EO-1 Hyperion satellite during a dust storm event and during a calm clean day. We show that, for the suspended dust, the absorption signature can be decoupled from scattering, allowing detection of key minerals. Our results, based on the visible and shortwave infrared hyperspectral data, demonstrate that the Bodele surface area is composed of iron-oxides, clays kaosmectite and sulfate groups gypsum . Atmospheric dust spectra downwind of Bodele reveal striking differences in absorption signatures across shortwave infrared from those of the underlying surface. Citation: Chudnovsky, A., E. Ben-Dor, A. B. Kostinski, and I. Koren 2009 , Mineral content analysis of atmospheric dust using hyperspectral information from space, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L15811, doi: 10.1029/2009GL037922. . Dust may affect clouds properties in two ways: by serving as cloud condensation nuclei CCN changing the cloud microphysical and dynamical properties, or by changing the local stability by absorbing and scattering the solar radiation. Such changes will affect the cloud lifetime, coverage and optical properties. The last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC report acknowledged that the forcing due to atmospheric aerosol poses the largest uncertainties in our understanding of the climate system. The knowledge of mineral composition of transported dust is essential to understanding of climate forcing and its magnitude, mineralogy of dust sources, aerosol optical properties, and dust biogeochemical feedbacks. Dust mineralogical content may provide clues for understanding the mechanisms behind dust variability and continental provenance.. A rare combination of global wind pattern, topography, mineralogical composition and surface soil properties could explain the intense dust production observed throughout the year in this area Figures 1a and 1b . The following is known about the dust dynamics of Bodélé: 1 the existence of the Bodélé Low Level Jet LLJ winds playing a key role in the dust emission and initial transport out of the region leading to long-range transport in the large-scale Harmattan northeasterlies; 2 the structure of the valley between the Tibesti 2600 m and Ennedi 1000 m massifs serves as a ‘wind lens’, guiding and focusing the surface winds to the Bodélé; and 3 , Bodélé mainly consisting of low density diatomite remains of silicate algae and eroded diatomite sand, and free of vegetation;MODIS Terra RGB image a for a clean day, June 21, 2003, at 0930 UTC and b for a dust storm day, June 7, 2003, at 0925 UTC. c Hyperion image collected during the clean day June 21, 2003 centered above the Bodélé depression as seen from MODIS image. d Reflectance spectra of selected areas, denoted as 1–8. The intrinsic spectral features that appear in the form of bands and slopes in the VIS 400–700 nm and NIR-SWIR 1300–2500 nm bidirectional reflection spectra of minerals are caused by various electronic and vibrational modes, for example, the 2200 nm features caused by vibrational combination tones involving the AlOH fundamental-bending mode. Materials that exhibit these features can be distinguished from those based on the MgOH bending modes, such as amphibole and carbonates, because the latter produce bands near 2300 nm and 2335 nm.. . Nevertheless, the conventional aerosol inversion of a few selected wavelengths such as MODIS; see Figure 1a and 1b was designed to retrieve the aerosol optical depth and some information on the spectral dependence such as fine fraction or Angstrom exponent . Therefore, the spectral resolution does not suffice to determine the mineral composition of atmospheric dust. While so far such hyperspectral technology has been used mostly for land and water applications, here we make the first attempt of using it to study atmospheric dust from a mineral perspective. In this study we confine ourselves to two questions: 1 Can we sense the atmospheric dust features in the short wave infrared spectral range 2100–2380 nm , despite the strong signal of the underlying surface? 2 If so, is it possible to extract atmospheric dust mineral composition? Below, we report that the answer is yes to both questions.. This enabled us to distinguish between high frequency e.g. absorbencies and low frequency e.g. scattering features. Both images were then processed to remove molecular attenuation via the ACORN atmospheric correction code AIG-LLC, Boulder, CO . Strong water vapor bands near 1400 and 1800 nm were removed because of the very weak spectral signals at these regions. Finally, the images were mutually georeferenced for subsequent spatial change detection analysis and spectral smoothing averaging of several consecutive values around a nominal wavelength was applied to every pixel in the image and matched to known mineralogical information. Additional smoothing filter segment size for averaging 3 × 3 was applied to SWIR region in order to remove the remaining noises. Next, we identify surface minerals lifted by the wind and staying aloft as dust. To that end, we analyze spectral reflectance from three different sites. Region of interest ROI is delineated on the dust image in a centre of a dust plume Figure 2 ; the corresponding ROI in the clean day data Figure 2 was delimited along the same image column 2 × 2 or 2 × 3 pixels in average, covering an area of 80 to 120 m, respectively . The average spectra of all pixels within each ROI for clean and dust days data were examined and then compared Figure 2 , right . The clean image pixels were chosen so that they are similar in their mineralogical composition both, visually and spectrally, for each studied area. To deduce mineralogical composition of the selected ROIs, we show the weighted spectral synthetic mixtures of pure minerals dashed lines that are closest to the spectra measured from Hyperion continuous lines on the clean and dust day. The synthetic spectra are obtained from using the Linear Spectral Unmixing techniques LSU . Briefly, LSU deconvolves spectrum into several pure minerals end-members, EM , derived from a laboratory-based pure mineral spectral library. The spectral library used in this study was generated by selecting spectra from USGS Spectral Library for Minerals database according to the Chad formation mineralogy. The source of reference was based on geologic map and a literature search. The constructed library contained phyllosilicates, sulfates, iron oxides, and carbonates 20 minerals . left Hyperion RGB image for a clean day 21 June, 2003 and a dust storm event 7 June, 2003 . right Comparison of reflectance spectra of Hyperion satellite continuous lines and synthetic mixtures of pure minerals dashed lines over same locations between the clean day blue lines and the dust day red lines . Differences in absorption wavelengths position between dust and clean curves are significant. Doublet absorption at 2163 nm combined with 2200 nm due to presence of kaolinite, are evident in the dust spectra, thus indicating its upstream airborne origin. This constitutes evidence for mineral-based tracking of atmospheric dust., LSU is employed to estimate as accurate as possible the main mineralogical components within an image., who collected 200 samples over the Bodélé and Lake Chad area. They found that clay mineral composition is dominated by smectite and kaolinite in the topsoils, with Fe-oxides/oxy-hydrates occurring regularly, with the exception of some limnic deposits, and that quartz and feldspars are the predominant minerals in the bulk samples.. The question is whether the absorption spectral signatures of the atmospheric dust can be detected despite these difficulties? With the hyperspectral and high spatial resolution data, the answer is Yes as can be seen in Figure 2 . All three cases highlight differences in absorption wavelengths between the “dusty day” and “clean day” curves, indicating that the spectrum of airborne dust is distinct from that of the underlying surface. Therefore, atmospheric dust originates upwind of the studied area, from sources containing the suspended minerals. The characteristic spectral signature of the dust pixels from areas A and B, associated with kaolinite, is absent on the ground. Different absorption structure at dust source of area C fit the spectral composition of montmorillonite with muscovite or microcline, and is significantly different from the ground spectra. Moreover, the absorption features of the all underlined surfaces A, B, and C around 2300 nm are also absent on their corresponding dust spectra.. Therefore, for the minerals that were detected in both the clean day and dusty day data, we can not rule out that the information came from the underlying background though it is likely that these minerals compose the atmospheric dust as well.[17]  Despite the insight we gained into the mineral composition of the dust derived from hyperspectral Hyperion image, much work remains to be done. There is the problem of contrast, typical of much remote sensing: how can one analyze dust pixels when the contrast with the underlying surface is weak? This is often the case, particularly in the immediate vicinity of the dust source, and then it is difficult to separate contribution of the dust plume from that of the underlying surface. What minerals are lifted and what are settled in the vicinity and downwind of the dust source? Another interesting question relates to the relative abundance of various minerals in the dust mixture or precise quantitative determination of dust mineralogical composition.[18]  In this paper, we asked whether the hyperspectral technology can assist in exploration of atmospheric dust. The main idea was: does the hyperspectral technology allow one to compare key minerals contained in atmospheric dust, relative to the underlying surface seen on a clear day. To that end, we demonstrated that indeed the spectral information of some of the key minerals in the suspended dust is not obscured by the scattering process and absorption features are detectable across SWIR region of spectra. Our evidence shows characteristic spectral signatures of atmospheric dusts, unlikely to be scattering artifacts. The dust properties were derived from the spectral signature in the SWIR 2100–2380 nm while those of the surface so from the VIS as well. Our approach of inferring mineralogical information of atmospheric dust aerosols from remote optical measurements suggests new possibilities in the general field of atmospheric remote sensing."
96,dust clouds ocean,"Enhanced aerosol backscatter adjacent to tropical trade wind clouds revealed by satellite-based lidar. There have been many proposed processes by which clouds modify aerosol properties, suggesting that aerosol properties near clouds are different than far from clouds. We provide the first satellite-based lidar observations of backscatter and color ratio, quantities directly related to aerosol properties, as a function of distance to cloud edge for boundary layer clouds over the western tropical Atlantic. We show backscatter and color ratio are enhanced adjacent to cloud edge, particularly near cloud top and cloud base. Specifically, layer integrated median backscatter increases by 31 +/- 3% and 42 +/- 2%, at wavelengths of 532 nm, and 1,064 nm, respectively, and layer averaged color ratio increases by 15 +/- 5%. Backscatter calculations suggest our observations adjacent to cloud are best explained by an aerosol size distribution with reduced number concentration, increased median radius, and decreased width compared to far from cloud.

Lett., 36, L14804, doi: 10.1029/2009GL039264.  along with the potential impact on global radiative forcing. These correlations may be caused by passive remote sensing artifacts, aerosol and cloud dependence on large scale meteorology, aerosol influence on cloud properties, or cloud influence on aerosol properties in the near cloud environment due to cloud processing. The first three points have been discussed in detail, however little has been published concerning the last point, since such observations are difficult to make with confidence. For example, in-situ sampling requires many long aircraft transects to acquire statistically significant results. Passive remote sensors provide large sample sets for estimating aerosol properties, typically aerosol optical depth AOD , but these estimates can be biased due to 3-D radiative cloud-adjacency effects, whereby solar radiation interacting with the cloud field is scattered by air molecules, aerosols, and the surface into the instruments' field-of-view. This can cause AOD overestimates greater than 100% near cloud edges from passive satellites, and smaller underestimates from sun-photometers. Active sensing with lidar offers several advantages over passive instruments, including range-resolved backscattered radiances, better cloud detection, and essentially no 3-D radiative cloud-adjacency effects when operated at night. Two notable studies used lidar to observe how aerosol properties change near cloud edge. The first and earliest study qualitatively reported an aerosol backscatter increase near two clouds from a ground-based lidar, while the second study estimated a mean AOD increase of 8∼17% when comparing 4.5 km to 0.1 km from cloud edge using the aircraft-based High Spectral Resolution Lidar HSRL . These studies require further quantitative investigation since measurements were made in daytime i.e., potential 3-D radiative cloud-adjacency effects and more samples are necessary for statistical robustness.. The focus is winter Dec. – Feb. to match the RICO time frame.. These products were used in two approaches. Approach A used only the 1/3 km resolution CLP, while approach B used both 1/3 km and 5 km resolution CLP. All clear or cloudy 1/3 km segments that fell within a cloudy 5 km segment were discarded from further analysis in approach B. We examined β ′ λ as a function of distance to cloud edges that were detected in the undiscarded 1/3 km resolution CLP in both approaches. Though approach B roughly halved the number of samples meeting our criteria, it did not quantitatively change our conclusions. Thus, we present approach A here. We use the CALIOP Vertical Feature Mask to identify clouds above 8.3 km since the 1/3 km resolution CLP only identifies clouds below this altitude.., causing aerosols to become larger due to hygroscopic growth; this enhances backscatter. Regions of enhanced humidity have the greatest horizontal extent near cloud top when an overlying stable layer exists, which in the tropics occurs around an altitude of 2 km. Also at cloud top, detrained cloud drops evaporate and leave behind larger, but fewer, aerosols compared to the entrained air due to droplet collision-coalescence within the cloud. Collision-coalescence occurs more often in thicker clouds, so its impact on aerosol size and hence, backscatter, is greatest at the tops of thicker clouds. Meanwhile, lateral mixing with dry air adjacent to cloud causes descending motion due to evaporative cooling, which may transport larger aerosols near cloud top to mid-cloud levels, enhancing backscatter. The backscatter enhancement maximum at lower altitudes 0.5 km to 0.75 km is adjacent to cloud bases, most of which are from small and shallow cumuli, and is possibly due to vertical advection of humid air below cloud base causing aerosol hygroscopic growth. Median color ratio χ ′ = β ′ 1064 / β ′ 532 in Figure 1c also exhibits enhancement near cloud edge with maxima at similar altitudes as β ′ 532 maxima. Color ratio depends strongly on particle size, bolstering the hypothesis that aerosols are largest near the top of thick clouds and cloud base. a Median backscatter at 532 nm. b Median backscatter at 532 nm normalized at each altitude by the horizontal average of median backscatter within 2.99 km of cloud edge at that altitude. Values greater than one indicate median backscatter is above the average median backscatter at that altitude. c Median color ratio.. Our results are consistent since β ′ 532 ∝ γ ′ 532 , bearing in mind that we focus on a large sample of clouds at night while they focus on a smaller sample of clouds in the day. We also vertically average the median χ ′ in Figure 1c from 0.5 km to 2.0 km and plot the result in Figure S3 . We find Δ χ ′ = 15 ± 5% when comparing 2.99 km to 0.33 km from cloud edge.Vertically integrated median backscatter at 532 nm blue and 1,064 nm red for night solid lines and day dashed lines . Error bars are the propagated standard error on the median backscatter.Errors bars are the propagated standard error on the median. The final row shows the parameter change combination that best fits our observations using a chi-squared minimization method.. Droplet collision-coalescence decreases N and increases R , though precipitation scavenging efficiently removes the largest cloud droplets, thereby decreasing σ and limiting the increase in R . Other scavenging processes nucleation, diffusion, and impaction scavenging decrease N and increase σ . We perform backscatter calculations to understand what changes in a typical maritime aerosol size distribution would produce our observations in Table 1 . We assume aerosol composition is ammonium sulfate for r ≤ 0.2 μ m, and sea salt for r > 0.2 μ m, typical for this region. Refractive indices for ammonium sulfate and sea salt are from Andrew Lacis' Database of Aerosol Refractive Indices http://gacp.giss.nasa.gov/data_sets/ and the Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds OPAC software, respectively. The assumed aerosol size distribution far from cloud is the OPAC “Maritime clean” tri-modal lognormal distribution at ambient RH = 80% where each mode j is defined by a median radius R j , total number concentration N j , and width σ j . We assume N j exponentially decreases in the vertical with a one kilometer scale height and we perform Mie calculations for the scattering cross section and scattering phase function. To determine the change in γ ′ λ due to a change in the size distribution, all modes of a parameter R j , N j , or σ j are increased by the same amount, holding the other two parameters fixed. The percent change Δ γ ′ λ is the fractional increase of the modified γ ′ λ versus the original γ ′ λ far from cloud, times 100%. Percent change in color ratio Δ χ ′ is computed similarly. Changing the parameter modes separately for each parameter may yield different results, but doing so requires interpreting more degrees of freedom than are available, i.e., our three observations. and ∼13% at visible wavelengths, bearing in mind that our analysis is at night, while theirs is during the day which may cause AOD underestimates due to 3-D radiative cloud-adjacency effects. A simultaneous increase in R j and decrease in N j and σ j is consistent with collision-coalescence with larger aerosols removed by precipitation scavenging, although precipitation scavenging may be minimal given that only ∼5% of these clouds precipitate. The increase in R j also suggests hygroscopic growth. We note that a 34% increase in R j is consistent with an RH increase from 80% to 94%, a reasonable RH increase near marine clouds. However, hygroscopic growth and scavenging processes broaden the distribution width, which is not deduced by the best fit. That no single process explains all our observations suggests several of these concurrent processes may be equally important in controlling the aerosol size distribution adjacent to cloud. As backscatter is stored at increasing distance from cloud edge, clouds outside of the lidar transect may modify aerosol properties within these profiles. To determine the influence of these off-transect clouds on average backscatter, we simulated 2-D fields of circular clouds with backscatter decaying exponentially from cloud edge. Averaging random transects through the cloud field revealed the exponentially decaying functionality was preserved within the e-folding distance to cloud edge, then approached a constant backscatter offset at further distances as observed in Figure 2 . are also plausible explanations.. The mechanisms causing diurnal and seasonal variability in backscatter enhancement adjacent to cloud edge remain the topic of future research."

Most GCMs General Circulation Models fail to reproduce the AOD aerosol optical depth peak over the Indo-Gangetic basin IGB as noticed through satellite observations. Insufficient data on aerosol composition makes it difficult to improve GCM results over this source region. In this work, we retrieve the composition and concentration of aerosols over the IGB region, to a first order approximation, by combining the spectral measurements of AOD, single scattering albedo and size distribution available from AERONET Aerosol Robotic Network and the extinction profile of aerosols from CALIOP Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization . Comparison of our results with AM2 Atmospheric GCM simulations reveal that AM2 is largely underestimating organics and black carbon concentrations over this region during all months. Sulfate is also underestimated during most months but, there is an overestimation from May to September. There is a compelling need for improving the aerosol inventories and dust sources over the region in order to make realistic assessment of the impacts of aerosols on the south Asian monsoon.

Observations from multiple satellite instruments like CALIOP, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS , Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer MISR , Ozone Monitoring Instrument OMI and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer TOMS , all show a persistent aerosol haze over the IGB region during the winter months, with AOD values among the highest in the world. and as observed by MODIS respectively. Figure 1c shows the comparison of monthly mean AODs at 0.5, while for all other components they are obtained from AEROCOM. Refractive indices and mass growth factors of individual aerosol components are same as in AM2 model. has shown that the extinction data from CALIOP exhibit an unusual drop in the lowest few hundred meters within 0.4 km above the surface. Therefore, we decided to set all extinction coefficients below 0.4 km to be same as its value around 0.4 km. This could introduce some bias towards lower extinction values near the surface but typically the uncertainty in extinction values from CALIOP is greater than this bias. We believe, this is the safest thing one can assume in a region where otherwise no data on extinction profile is available.  Table 1 lists the surface and total column concentration of major aerosol components viz. sulfate, BC and OC over Gandhi College and Kanpur as inferred using our minimization method and as simulated by the GFDL-AM2 model. Uncertainties assigned with the retrievals are estimated on the basis of a range of sensitivity tests carried out with respect to the error values associated with various parameters used in the minimization process as discussed by which showed that due to enhanced atmospheric mixing during summertime, BC is lifted to higher levels such that its columnar loading remains similar as in winter. Further comparison show that AM2 underestimates dust concentrations over the IGB region by a factor of 2–6 during winter, pre-monsoon and post-monsoon months. Presently we are unable to compare our retrievals with any in-situ results due to lack of aerosol composition data over this region.Surface measurements are in [2008] has shown that organic matter comprises of more than 90% of the aerosols emitted along with the smoke from leaves, significantly higher than from wood burning. Thus, in order to make realistic estimates of the impact of aerosols on the south Asian monsoon, there is a compelling need for improving the existing aerosol inventories and dust sources over the region taking into account the aerosols emitted through such waste burning activities and possibly due to land use changes.[16]  Observations from multiple satellite instruments show a persistent aerosol haze over the IGB region during the winter months, with AOD values among the highest in the world. Yet, the most sophisticated GCMs fail to reproduce this high AOD belt in their simulations. Insufficient data on aerosol composition makes it difficult to improve model results over this important source region. In this work, we retrieve the composition and concentration of aerosols over the IGB region, to a first order approximation, by combining the spectral measurements of AOD, single scattering albedo and size distribution available from AERONET stations and the extinction profile of aerosols from CALIOP. Comparison of our results with AM2 simulations reveal that the GCM is largely underestimating organics and BC concentrations over this region almost during all months almost a factor of 10 during winter months . Sulfate aerosols are also underestimated during most months however, there is an overestimation from May to September. There is a compelling need for improving the aerosol inventories and dust sources over the region in order to make realistic assessment of the impacts of aerosols on the south Asian monsoon."
98,dust,"Dust and smoke transport from Africa to South America: Lidar profiling over Cape Verde and the Amazon rainforest. Quasi-simultaneous vertically resolved multiwavelength aerosol Raman lidar observations were conducted in the near field Praia, Cape Verde, 15 degrees N, 23.5 degrees W and in the far field Manaus, Amazon basin, Brazil, 2.5 degrees S, 60 degrees W of the long-range transport regime between West Africa and South America. Based on a unique data set case study of spectrally resolved backscatter and extinction coefficients, and of the depolarization ratio a detailed characterization of aerosol properties, vertical stratification, mixing, and aging behavior during the long-distance travel in February 2008 dry season in western Africa, wet season in the Amazon basin is presented. While highly stratified aerosol layers of dust and smoke up to 5.5 km height were found close to Africa, the aerosol over Manaus was almost well-mixed, reached up to 3.5 km, and mainly consisted of aged biomass burning smoke.

Lett., 36, L11802, doi: 10.1029/2009GL037923. , including the important transport from Africa to North and South America by which large amounts of mineral dust and biomass burning smoke cross the tropical North Atlantic. However, there is still a lack of detailed knowledge of the vertical stratification of smoke and dust, the height levels at which these particles typically travel across the ocean, of the mixing and aging behavior, and the corresponding changes in the optical, microphysical and chemical aerosol properties during the long-distance transport. Without such knowledge, the quantification of the influence of aerosol particles on solar radiative transfer direct effect and cloud processes indirect effect with atmospheric models seems to be impossible.. This letter shows that the opposite mainly smoke advection can occur, too. Our observations corroborate the findings of permit us to determine vertical profiles of volume extinction coefficients of particles at 355 and 532 nm, backscatter coefficients at 355, 532, and 1064 nm, lidar ratios at 355 and 532 nm, and depolarization ratios at 355 nm Brazil and 710 nm Cape Verde . The computation of backscatter and extinction coefficients as well as microphysical properties is described by . For the Manaus optical data the inversions indicate effective radii from 0.35 to 0.45 μ m for the aged biomass burning particles in accordance with the low extinction-related Ångström exponents. After an initial phase two days of condensational growth, coagulation dominates. The large effective radii over the Amazon basin partly result from water up-take by the particles over the rainforest.. Since smoke and dust have different light absorbing and scattering properties and differently influence cloud formation, a careful consideration of the relative contribution of smoke and dust to the aerosol load and changes in the mixture during long-range transport in models is necessary to obtain a realistic view of the aerosol impact on climate in this region of the world. Long-range airborne and spaceborne lidar observations may provide the required information. Finally, it is often emphasized that the Amazon rainforest is a pristine site during the wet season. Our study shows that this is obviously not always the case. Smoke and dust is immediately mixed down to the ground after entrainment into the local boundary layer."
99,aerosol,"Evidence of the aerosol core-shell mixing state over Europe during the heat wave of summer 2003 by using CHIMERE simulations and AERONET inversions. The aim of this work consists to infer the most probable mixing state of aerosols over the European continent during the heat wave of summer 2003, where large concentrations of biomass burning and anthropogenic aerosols have been observed. The methodology presented here is based on the Single Scattering Albedo SSA sensitivity to the mixing state of particles. Three different mixing cases; external mixing, internal mixing, and core-shell type mixing have been considered. Composite SSA has been computed for this intense pollution event over Europe and are compared with the AErosol RObotic NETwork AERONET retrieved SSA values. The most probable mixing state seems to be core-shell mixing, with secondary aerosols coating over primary soot and mineral dust. This work underlines clearly that this specific representation should be used in modeling exercises for simulating anthropogenic and/or biomass burning direct and semi-direct aerosol effects and climate impact over the European region.

The principle of this study is to compute aerosol column-averaged SSA from CHIMERE model simulations for three different mixing states: internally homogeneous, core-shell and external and to compare them with SSA issued from AERONET retrievals. This work is focused on the European region, where few studies about the treatment of the particle mixing have been conducted in spite of the presence of different aerosol species.. study. Anthropogenic dust emissions are taken from EMEP inventory and natural dust are transported from boundary conditions calculated on a monthly base, and are locally produced within the domain after  In the external treatment, we consider that each particle consists of only one chemical substance. Here, we used the Mie code published by . Similarly, a mean particle density is determined. The extinction, scattering and absorption efficiencies of a single particle are calculated using the Mie theory for homogeneous sphere. The methodology developed by . In our simulations, primary aerosols soot and mineral dust are assumed to be the core. Here, “soot” is referenced as a mixture of BC and organic carbon. Secondary particles sulfates, nitrates, ammonium, secondary organic aerosols and sea salt are assumed to be the shell material. The real and imaginary parts of the core and the shell have been determined using a volume average procedure.. Figure 1 shows mean PM2.5 surface concentrations simulated by CHIMERE and averaged over the first ten days of August 2003. In this figure, the wide extent of the pollution episode is clearly illustrated with mean PM2.5 surface concentrations ranging from 15 to 30  In a second time, sensitivity tests have been performed on the BC refractive index by using the values of 1.75–0.44i and 1.95–0.66i. The SSA calculated values are then compared with those obtained with the reference value of 1.87–0.569i used thereafter in our simulations REF . These tests indicate discrepancies on the modeled SSA of ±0.01 for the external and core-shell aerosol mixing and ±0.02 for the internally homogeneous one. Moreover, in the absence of extensive validation of BC mass concentrations simulated by CHIMERE, we evaluated the impact of an increase/decrease of 20% of simulated BC mass concentrations on modeled SSA, showing a discrepancy of ±0.02 for the three aerosol mixing states. These two types of sensitivity tests indicate that one can reasonably consider cumulative uncertainties on modeled SSA of ±0.03 for the external and core-shell aerosol mixing and ±0.04 for the internally homogeneous one. and 0.87 < SSA < 0.91 over south eastern Spain during August 2003. Figure 3a shows with no ambiguity important disagreement between model and AERONET concerning the two other approaches. Indeed, the internally homogeneous mixing is more sensitive to the choice of the BC complex refractive index and underestimates 0.80 ± 0.04 the mean observed SSA value. This low modeled value denotes a too much absorbing aerosol layer, which is consistent with previous findings showing that an homogeneous mixing of BC within less absorbing materials overestimates its absorption as more radiation interact with BC. Moreover, the external approach overestimates 0.94 ± 0.03 the AERONET mean SSA value, denoting a too much reduction of particle absorption when BC is not internally-mixed; as shown by Jacobson and modeled calculated from sensitivity tests described in section 4 SSA. b Time-averaged simulated SSA core-shell REF at 440 nm at the surface SSA surf between 1 July and 10 August 2003 and locations of the 10 AERONET sites circles .R spatio-temp is the correlation calculated using the total number of SSA samples N = 969 on the 10 AERONET sites for the whole study period 1 July to 10 August of 2003 .. Similarly, the decrease of SSA surf in northern France and Benelux regions reflects the accumulation of anthropogenic absorbing aerosols high BC concentrations in these high urbanized and industrialized areas. Moreover, important concentrations of scattering biogenic aerosols over the Massif Central region and scattering anthropogenic aerosols high sulfates concentrations in northern Italy Pô Valley Figure 1 result in high values of modeled SSA surf in these areas.[18]  Three different mixing scenarios of aerosols are tested during the intense heat wave of summer 2003 over Europe characterized by large concentrations of biomass burning and urban/industrial aerosols. Column-averaged simulated SSA is compared with the AERONET retrieved SSA, revealing clearly that primary aerosols soot and mineral dust coated with secondary species as treated by the core-shell method stands for as the most probable mixing state of aerosols over Europe. Indeed, the mean modeled core-shell SSA 0.89 ± 0.03 is close to the observed one 0.90 ± 0.04 . The external and “pure” internally homogeneous approaches result respectively in higher 0.94 ± 0.03 and lower 0.80 ± 0.04 mean modeled SSA as compared to AERONET."
100,aerosol,"Pollution-enhanced reactive chlorine chemistry in the eastern tropical Atlantic boundary layer. This study examines atmospheric reactive chlorine chemistry at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory in the eastern tropical Atlantic. During May - June, 2007, Cl 2 levels ranged from below detection similar to 2 ppt to 30 ppt. Elevated Cl 2 was associated with high HNO 3 40 to 120 ppt in polluted continental outflow transported in the marine boundary layer MBL to the site. Lower Cl 2 was observed in recently subsided air masses with multiday free tropospheric oceanic trajectories and in air containing Saharan dust. Model simulations show that the observations of elevated Cl 2 in polluted marine air are consistent with initiation of Cl chemistry by OH + HCl and subsequent heterogeneous, autocatalytic Cl cycling involving marine aerosols. Model estimates suggest that Cl atom reactions significantly impact the fates of methane and dimethylsulfide at Cape Verde and are moderately important for ozone cycling. Citation: Lawler, M. J., B. D. Finley, W. C. Keene, A. A. P. Pszenny, K. A. Read, R. von Glasow, and E. S. Saltzman 2009 , Pollution-enhanced reactive chlorine chemistry in the eastern tropical Atlantic boundary layer, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L08810, doi: 10.1029/2008GL036666. . Atomic chlorine can cause ozone loss via catalytic pathways such as: The net impact of Cl on tropospheric ozone depends primarily on NO x levels. Under high-NO x conditions, the oxidation of hydrocarbons by Cl results in ozone production due to enhanced formation of peroxy radicals., Eulerian and Lagrangian field studies of hydrocarbon ratios, laboratory studies, and model simulations. Estimates of marine boundary layer MBL Cl atom levels range from <10 3 to >10 5 cm −3 .. reported up to 1200 ppt ClNO 2 in highly polluted air off Houston, Texas. These coastal measurements provide evidence of active chlorine cycling in polluted air. However, reactive chlorine levels are highly variable, and the controlling factors are not well understood.: Atomic Cl and Br subsequently regenerate HOCl and HOBr via reactions 1 and 2 . Model calculations suggest that Br should dominate the halogen chemistry in clean marine air but that Cl chemistry is enhanced via aerosol acidification under more polluted conditions.. The boundary layer was well mixed and capped by a strong inversion. Skies were mostly clear with occasional periods of scattered cumulus clouds. Moderate levels of African dust were observed on days 147–151, but no major dust outbreaks occurred during the campaign. There were no local sources of pollution upwind of the site other than occasional ship plumes, and NO x levels were extremely low <30 ppt 95% of the time , with rare, brief ∼1 hr excursions of <900 ppt.. The inlet was located at about 3m above ground 13m above sea level . Ambient air was drawn through a 3m long, multi-stage laminar flow inlet and ionized using a 63 Ni beta-emitting foil to form Cl 2 − ions from atmospheric Cl 2 . Cl 2 − was mass filtered, then collisionally dissociated to Cl − , which was mass filtered and detected. The instrument blank was assessed by sampling ambient air through carbonate-coated glass wool. The instrument was field-calibrated using gas standards 14–57 ppt generated from a permeation tube calibrated both gravimetrically and by reacting its output with a neutral KI solution and measuring the production of I 3 − by absorbance. The mean detection limit DL was 1.9 ± 0.7 ppt 1.Modeled mean boundary layer O 3 , Cl, Cl 2 , and HOCl. Polluted case red dashed , Clean case solid black . Time intervals labeled show range of MBL transit times of Open Ocean and Iberian air mass types before observation at Cape Verde. Dots emphasize model data that should be compared to Open Ocean and Iberian Influenced observational data. Gray shading indicates night. BrCl levels were ∼10 ppt under Polluted conditions and ∼4 ppt under Clean conditions, both higher than observed levels <2 ppt . This discrepancy may indicate that the model overestimates the extent of bromide depletion in sea salt aerosols, causing a shift from Br 2 production to BrCl production.. If the mean Cl levels in the Polluted case were present year-round in a 1 km deep MBL from 30° N to 30° S, the global atmospheric lifetime of CH 4 with respect to oxidation by Cl atoms τ CH4-Cl would be ∼150 years, as compared with τ CH4-OH of ∼10 years. In that scenario, low latitude MBL Cl would represent ∼7% of the global CH 4 sink. For the Clean case two days into the run, Cl levels were roughly 4 times lower, and the same calculation gives τ CH4-Cl of ∼600 years ∼2% of the global CH 4 sink .., which indicate that the combined influences of transformations involving Br x and I x account for ∼30% of the total O 3 loss with 11% of the total attributed to Br x alone.[26]  This study suggests a link between chlorine cycling and the advection of polluted air in the MBL over the eastern Tropical Atlantic. In particular, higher Cl 2 levels were observed in aged polluted air than in clean marine air, most likely as a result of aerosol acidification. Therefore, regions of very active chlorine chemistry over the oceans are likely to be spatially heterogeneous and time-varying. Simultaneous gas-phase, speciated Cl x measurements and observationally-constrained aerosol pH calculations are needed to quantitatively assess the mechanisms involved in this process."
101,aerosol,"Hygroscopicity and cloud droplet activation of mineral dust aerosol. Hygroscopicity and cloud condensation nucleus CCN activity were measured for three mineral dust samples: one from the Canary Islands, representing North African dust transported across the Atlantic; one from outside Cairo, representing North African dust transported to the eastern Mediterranean; and Arizona Test Dust, representing dust in the southwestern United States. To reaerosolize bulk samples, dust samples were either suspended in high purity water and particles generated by atomization, or samples were resuspended in dry air using a fluidized bed. Only the Canary Island sample generated from aqueous suspension showed appreciable hygroscopic growth at subsaturated conditions; all other samples exhibited diameter growth factors of less than 1.1 for relative humidities <= 90%. Despite their low hygroscopicities at subsaturated conditions, all samples activated as cloud droplets at supersaturations lower than required for insoluble particles. We suggest that the CCN activity of these mineral dusts are well-represented using the hygroscopicity parameter 0.01 <= kappa <= 0.08. Citation: Koehler, K. A., S. M. Kreidenweis, P. J. DeMott, M. D. Petters, A. J. Prenni, and C. M. Carrico 2009 , Hygroscopicity and cloud droplet activation of mineral dust aerosol, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L08805, doi: 10.1029/2009GL037348. . Aeolian dust has an impact worldwide on biogeochemical cycles, including providing nutrients to the world oceans, fertilizing jungles in Amazonia, and transporting disease carrying spores, which contribute to coral reef die-off. In the atmosphere, these particles degrade visibility, contribute significantly to global average optical depth, and may serve as cloud condensation nuclei CCN or ice nuclei, thereby impacting cloud development and influencing the global climate and hydrologic cycle. Dusts from various regions in the world have different compositions, and thus can interact with clouds in a variety of ways that are not yet fully understood. Submicron dust particles, composed primarily of insoluble minerals, are typically modeled as CCN inactive until they have become mixed with hygroscopic material e.g., sulfates, nitrates . Scant data exist on direct measurements of the hygroscopicity and CCN activity of natural, heterogeneous mineral dust particles.. The bulk sample was not processed or sieved prior to use. The second surface sample was collected outside Cairo, Egypt hereafter, Saharan Dust, “SD” . During the spring, Sharav cyclones pass over this region and can mobilize and transport large quantities of mineral dust to the Eastern Mediterranean, East Asia, and the Himalayas. Prior to being shipped to our laboratory the SD sample was sieved to remove particles larger than 75  A cloud condensation nucleus counter CCNc DMT, Model CCN-2 was used to determine the critical dry diameters of the samples for selected water supersaturations, Water uptake by ATD particles in an HTDMA was studied previously by generated particles from an aqueous suspension, similar to our wet-generation method, and reported a resulting double-peaked dry particle size distribution. Particles in the smaller mode, of mobility size 56 nm, began to take up water for.  Figure 1c shows also concluded that 250 and 400 nm ATD particles became wetted enough to structurally collapse after exposure to RH > 90%, as indicated by the restructuring they observed under those conditions. At higher RH , sparingly soluble species that do not contribute to the overall hygroscopicity in the GF measurements can dissolve and contribute to the observed CCN activity. A similar discrepancy that might also be attributable to slightly soluble species was observed for dry-generated SD particles, which exhibited low hygroscopicity κ = 0.008 at water-subsaturated conditions, and higher hygroscopicity at water supersaturations κ = 0.054 . The restructuring and small GFs observed for many of our samples in the HTDMA may be indicative of water uptake by adsorption. Recently, Sorjamaa and Laaksonen for RH < 80% to the Frenkel, Halsey and Hill FHH isotherm using A = 3 and B = 2. As shown by Sorjamaa and Laaksonen   Figure 2 demonstrates that two broad groupings of cloud droplet activation behavior were observed for our measurements. The more-hygroscopic, higher-κ dust types are represented by 0.2 < κ < 1.1; less-hygroscopic dust types are bounded by 0.01 < κ < 0.08. Dust from desiccated playa regions, as represented by OLD, is likely to contain a subset of hygroscopic submicron particles having CCN activity falling within the higher-κ range, and as such, the CCN activity of these “dust” particles will be similar to that of comparably-sized sea salt or ammoniated sulfates. However, most natural airborne mineral dust particles generated from sources with low soluble contents likely will exhibit CCN activity more consistent with the lower-κ category. The nonzero hygroscopicity of submicron lower-κ dust makes it likely that such particles have the potential to alter cloud droplet concentrations, impact cloud radiative properties, and affect the lifetime of clouds. Although the number concentrations of particles with diameter >200 nm are generally low and thus their overall effect on total cloud drop concentrations is small, even low number concentrations of particles activating at low supersaturations may strongly affect the evolution of precipitation in warm clouds. We suggest that future modeling studies that include contributions of dust to the atmospheric aerosol from these major surface regions do not assign zero hygroscopicity to minimally-processed dust particles, but represent their hygroscopicity using 0.01 ≤ κ ≤ 0.08 with a suggested median κ = 0.03, or via an equivalent representation that allows submicron dust to activate at realistically low supersaturations."
103,impact clouds climate aerosol,"Enhanced pre-monsoon warming over the Himalayan-Gangetic region from 1979 to 2007. Fundamental to the onset of the Indian Summer Monsoon is the land-sea thermal gradient from the Indian Ocean to the Himalayas-Tibetan Plateau HTP . The timing of the onset is strongly controlled by the meridional tropospheric temperature gradient due to the rapid pre-monsoon heating of the HTP compared to the relatively cooler Indian Ocean. Analysis of tropospheric temperatures from the longest available record of microwave satellite measurements reveals widespread warming over the Himalayan-Gangetic region and consequent strengthening of the land-sea thermal gradient. This trend is most pronounced in the pre-monsoon season, resulting in a warming of 2.7 degrees C in the 29-year record 1979-2007 , when this region is strongly influenced by dust aerosols at elevated altitudes. The enhanced tropospheric warming is accompanied by increased atmospheric loading of absorbing aerosols, particularly vertically extended dust aerosols, raising the possibility that aerosol solar heating has amplified the seasonal warming and in turn strengthened the land-sea gradient. Citation: Gautam, R., N. C. Hsu, K.-M. Lau, S.-C. Tsay, and M. Kafatos 2009 , Enhanced pre-monsoon warming over the Himalayan-Gangetic region from 1979 to 2007, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L07704, doi:10.1029/2009GL037641. . Warm air rising over the landmass throughout the troposphere, in response to the pre-monsoon heating of the HTP, causes the inflow of moist air from the ocean towards the continent. In particular, the middle-upper tropospheric temperature gradient over the HTP and the oceanic region to the south is a strong control of the timing of the onset of the Asian monsoon. Additionally, the Himalayas act as a barrier to the moisture-laden strong monsoon winds, resulting in heavy rainfall over South Asia that forms the bulk of the annual precipitation during each summer, from June through September. The Himalayas also contain the largest ice-covered regions of the Earth's surface outside the poles and their glaciers form a source of major rivers in South Asia, such as the Indus and the Ganges, that serve about 900 million living in the highly fertile Indo-Gangetic Plains IGP that encompass parts of northern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Along with the monsoon rainfall, rivers originating from the glaciers provide water needed for agriculture which is the mainstay of economy of the South Asian countries.. Through general circulation model GCM simulations, it has been shown that aerosol-induced surface dimming over the Indian Ocean results in less evaporation from the ocean surface, thereby reducing moisture inflow into South Asia which in turn causes weakening of the monsoon rainfall. On the other hand,  In addition, aerosol solar heating combined with increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases has been modeled in warming the troposphere over Asia. In general, the global tropospheric warming, in recent decades, is recognized to be partly of anthropogenic origin as simulated by GCMs. Consistent with model simulations, microwave satellite observations of the free troposphere since 1979 have also shown an upward trend in the tropospheric temperatures associated with global warming. In the context of the strong control of seasonal heating over the HTP on the South Asian monsoon dynamics and the regional hydrological cycle; and in relation with global climate change as well, we examine here tropospheric temperature trends using satellite-borne Microwave Sounding Unit MSU data over the Indian Monsoon region from 1979 to 2007, and explore the possible role of aerosol forcing in the observed trends. by applying statistical combinations to different MSU channels in order to minimize the influence of stratospheric cooling on the tropospheric temperature signal. Aerosol products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS , namely Dark-Target and Deep Blue, onboard NASA's Aqua satellite, were used to analyze distribution of Aerosol Optical Depth AOD over dark vegetated and bright arid/semi-arid regions, respectively. in conjunction with instantaneous surface pyranometer measurements. In addition, aerosol optical properties from sunphotometer measurements, in central IGP, were provided as input to the radiative transfer model. Instantaneous temperature profiles from AIRS/AMSU using microwave retrieval were also used to infer the influence of aerosol forcing on tropospheric temperatures. Daily profiles for a four-year period from 2003–2006 in May were co-located over sunphotometer measurements and were subsequently grouped in high-dust and low-dust loading days based on the combined information from AOD and Angstrom Exponent α , which is a first-order indicator of particle size. The land-sea thermal gradient is also governed by the Himalayan snow cover extent in spring and early summer. Since a substantial fraction of solar radiation is required for the melting of snow accompanied by less energy available for heating the underlying ground surface, therefore, in general, excessive snowfall results in colder surface temperatures. Reduced snow cover, on the contrary, is considered to be responsible for stronger land-sea thermal gradient. Concurrent with the warming trends reported here, a progressive decline in snow cover extent has been observed from satellite data over the HTP annually and in May as well since 1979.. During the strong pre-monsoon inflow, dust aerosols are transported from the Northwestern deserts of India/Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula to the Himalayan-Gangetic region. The towering Himalayas form a barrier to the passage of dust storms resulting in the accumulation of dust particles, largely over northwestern India and the foothills of the Himalayas. Dust activity usually starts in March–April and peaks during May, combined with heavy atmospheric pollution over northern India, and results in maximum aerosol loading prior to the monsoon. Due to enhanced convection and large-scale topographic variations in the Himalayan-Gangetic region, aerosols transported with the pre-monsoon winds are vertically advected to elevated altitudes up to 8 km as shown in recent space-borne lidar measurements and air-mass trajectory simulations . The pre-monsoon AOD clearly shows the passage of dust loading over the Thar Desert in Northwestern India/Pakistan and the IGP bounded by the Himalayan-Hindu-Kush Mountains Figure 2a . The AOD is projected as a function of surface topography in order to distinctly highlight the high aerosol loading as high as 0.8 at elevated altitudes >3km over the foothills of the Himalayas. Vertical extent of aerosols piling up against the slopes of Himalayas, well over 5 km, is also evident from CALIPSO lidar backscatter Figure 2b . With the arrival of monsoon rain, net aerosol loading significantly drops, due to the aerosol washout from the atmosphere. a Mean MODIS AOD, during pre-monsoon period 2003 to 2006, projected as a function of surface topography, and b CALIPSO backscatter profile from Southern India to the Himalayas, reveals the vertical extent of aerosols at elevated altitudes >5 km piling up against the slopes of the Himalayas. Inset image shows the lidar transect on 12 May 2007. Backscatter signal from aerosols usually lie in the Yellow-Red color scale and clouds are marked by pink, grey and white colors.. This northward migration of tropospheric temperature anomaly, due to the atmospheric feedback, is clearly observed with respect to the increasing aerosol loading in the spatial distributions of long-term trends derived from the MSU and TOMS observations, respectively.. Overall, we find enhanced warming, both in lower and middle troposphere, during pre-monsoon season, most pronounced in May, which is indicative of a strengthened meridional circulation pattern, consistent with the EHP mechanism.Red and blue curves solid show inter-annual variations of temperatures in the middle 4–7 km and lower surface-4 km troposphere, respectively, over northern India 25–35°N, 69–82°E for March–April–May MAM period mean from 1979 to 2007. Straight lines dotted indicate the linear trends with in the middle red and lower blue troposphere, respectively. TOMS Aerosol Index variations during MAM over northern India since 1979 are shown by black dashed curve.. Dust deposition over snow cover acts to reduce the snow albedo and enhances absorbed solar radiation and snow melt rates. In addition to the enhanced tropospheric warming over the western Himalayan region near the snow surface, increasing dustiness could work in concert or independently in the melting the Himalayan snow cover. Although it may appear valid, however, it is not straightforward to attribute the warming as due to increasing aerosol loading, especially the presence of dust aerosols at elevated altitudes as shown here. A causal link in the opposite sense may also exist such that warming of the Himalayas at higher elevations and the subsequent rising motion may lead to enhanced inflow of air-mass from arid landmasses during the pre-monsoon season.. As the atmosphere warms, its capacity to hold water vapor increases, which in turn provides a positive feedback to the tropospheric warming. Our ongoing work suggests a plausible response of the enhanced warming in May to be associated with an increase of water vapor flux over northern India with strong positive trends of All India Rainfall in June not shown . The monsoon rainfall variability associated with aerosol-induced heating is a subject of an ongoing study, and will be reported in a separate paper. This paper is focused on enhanced pre-monsoon tropospheric warming over HTP, increased aerosol loading and enhanced water vapor see auxiliary material that are physically consistent with the key elements of the EHP effects by dust and soot aerosols and related recent studies. In summary, the enhanced warming of the Himalayan-Gangetic region and the relatively smaller positive trend over the Indian Ocean appears to have strengthened the land-sea thermal gradient which may influence the monsoon rainfall variability. Together with the possible alterations to the monsoon dynamics on seasonal-to-interannual time scales, the observed warming at elevated altitudes, if continues, may also have direct implications to the Himalayan glaciers and snowpacks and in turn the hydrological cycle over much of South Asia, which has received growing scientific attention."
104,dust,"Shortwave versus longwave direct radiative forcing by Taklimakan dust aerosols. Six Mays from 2001 to 2006 of aerosol optical depth from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer and short- and longwave flux from the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy Budget Scanner are combined to estimate radiative forcing of dust aerosols in the Taklimakan Desert 75 degrees E-95 degrees E, 36 degrees N-42 degrees N, elevation < 1600 m . The cloud-free dust shortwave versus longwave forcing per aerosol optical depth at about 05:00 UTC are -48.1 and 28.4 W m -2 , respectively. Dust longwave warming offsets 58% of dust shortwave cooling and the overall dust radiative effect is to cool the Earth system. Annual shortwave and longwave forcing efficiencies vary from 26.7 to 63.8 and 18.3 to 39.3 W m -2 , respectively, due to changes in surface properties. Radiative transfer model simulations also suggest Earth's system is cooled in the shortwave but warmed in the longwave by Taklimakan dust aerosols. Citation: Xia, X., and X. Zong 2009 , Shortwave versus longwave direct radiative forcing by Taklimakan dust aerosols, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L07803, doi:10.1029/2009GL037237. . Dust aerosols reflect SW radiation back to the top of the atmosphere TOA and thereby cool Earth's system. Dust aerosols absorb LW radiation in the atmospheric window channel and thereby warm Earth's system. Such a warming effect could be significant, as suggested by a few observation-based estimates and radiative transfer model simulations.. This is likely due to the relatively high surface albedo and large heterogeneity of the surface reflectance. The LW effect of Saharan dust over the Atlantic Ocean accounts for 10% to 30% of the instantaneous SW effect. The discrepancy between model simulations and satellite observations suggests that instantaneous mineral dust LW forcing in July can be as much as 50 W m −2 for 12:00 UTC in the cloud-free regions. Sahara dust LW forcing at the TOA in the six regions ranges from 1 to 21 W m −2 and the mean value is 15 W m −2 . A mixture of dust, sea-salt, and pollution in the northern Indian Ocean can impose a LW warming that could reduce the SW effect by about 45% to 70%. Radiative transfer model simulations show that the aerosol LW forcing increases with the surface skin temperature and the aerosol layer height and decreases with water vapor. This implies that information about these important factors should be available in order to derive high quality aerosol LW forcing. However, they are not well characterized by either observations or simulations.. An observation-based estimation of SW aerosol forcing over land is firstly presented using merged satellite observations of aerosols, clouds, and radiation.. However, simulations have rarely been corroborated empirically, especially in the Taklimakan Desert. In this study, the radiative effect of the Taklimakan dust is estimated using six years of merged satellite data for the month of May. We extend the approach by . In this product, the higher resolution MODIS data, such as scene identification along with cloud and aerosol properties are averaged over the larger CERES footprint using point spread functions. The second is the MISR level 2 daily aerosol product that contains the aerosol optical depth with 17.6 km 2 resolution for each orbit. Comparisons of MISR AODs with those of ground-based remote sensing showed good correlation with no obvious systematic biases or trends over desert sites. The MISR AODs are highly correlated with ground-based remote sensing AODs and the root-mean-square-error of MISR AODs was 0.06. The MISR AOD data are collocated spatially and temporally with the CERES SSF data as follows: all instantaneous MISR pixels that fall within the CERES footprint and correspond to the same observation time are located and the arithmetic average of the AOD is computed. Given the fact that the spatial resolution of the MISR AOD is close to that of CERES and the change of respective MISR pixel sizes is little due to the narrow width of the MISR, point spread function weighting of the CERES is not assigned in the collocation algorithm. However, the change in CERES footprint size is accounted for. To account for this, the CERES pixel size in the along- and across-track dimensions is calculated as a function of viewing geometry and is used to estimate CERES footprint size. The MODIS cloud cover information from the merged CERES SSF product is used to remove cloudy pixels. Those pixels with cloud fraction >0.5% and sub-pixel clear area percentages <99.9% are removed. In order to avoid using large pixel sizes at large scan angles, the analysis is restricted to CERES pixels with satellite viewing and solar zenith angles <60°.. In the LW spectrum, the dust optical properties are calculated using in situ measurements of refractive index and AERONET size distribution. The long-range transport and vertical distribution of Asian dust aerosols were directly observed by the two-wavelength Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization CALIOP . Here, the level 1B Ver. 2.01 CALIOP total attenuated backscatter coefficients at 532 nm are used to retrieve aerosol extinction coefficient profiles based on the Fernald's inversion method. The Level 1B data are averaged to a horizontal resolution of 5 km before the inversion. The Level 2 Cloud-Aerosol Discrimination data are used to screen out cloud signals. The inversion is started from an altitude of 14 km down to the ground surface and the lidar ratio of 35 sr is assumed. The daily conventional atmospheric sounding at 6 radio sounding stations surrounding the Taklimakan Desert in May from 2001 to 2006 are averaged to obtain the typical temperature and moisture profiles. Given the fact that information about surface albedo and surface skin temperature is limited, the surface albedo and surface skin temperature are set to vary from 0.18 to 0.26 with 0.1 step and 310 to 330 k with 5 k step in the model simulations, respectively..CALIOP dust extinction coefficient profile derived from CALIOP Level 1B attenuated backscattering coefficient data for 13 days in May of 2007 and 2008. The thick curve represents the mean profile.. The value at Dunhuang is 0.97. The SBDART simulations with this value, as seen from Figure 2 , can produce the observed positive correlation between aerosol and SW flux at the TOA. Note that dust SW forcing in the Saharan and the Arabian regions are very low. These are probably due to the higher surface albedo there as compared to the Taklimakan Desert. The broadband white-sky albedo 300–5000 nm in May 2001 is larger than 0.4 in the Saharan and Arabian deserts; however, it is lower than 0.25 in the Taklimakan Desert. The SBDART simulations show very small dust SW effect if the model is driven by the surface albedo of 0.4 not shown . The negative relationship between the LW flux and AOD is because dust aerosols absorb LW radiation emitted by the surface and emit to the TOA at a colder temperature when compared to the surface. The SBDART, driven by the aforementioned aerosol optical properties, can also produce the negative correlation between AOD and LW flux. We derive the dust SW and LW forcing efficiencies from relationships between the MISR AOD and the CERES SW as well as LW flux, respectively. The dust radiative forcing efficiency DRFE is defined as the flux perturbations due to one unit of dust optical depth. The DRFE in the SW spectrum DREF SW and in the LW spectrum DREF LW is −48.1 W m −2 and 28.4 W m −2 per AOD, respectively. This suggests the overall dust radiative effect is still to cool Earth's system, although the dust LW warming can offset 58% of the SW cooling.The relationships between the MISR aerosol optical depth at 550 nm the x-axis and the CERES TOA left shortwave flux y-axis and right longwave flux. The data points are binned by the values of MISR AOD taken at regular intervals 2.5% from the cumulative distribution function. The short horizontal and vertical bars represent the standard deviation of AOD and flux, respectively. The dashed lines represent the SBDART simulations with varying surface albedos SW and surface skin temperatures LW , respectively. The CERES TOA LW flux, as shown in Figure 4 , generally tends to decrease as the MISR AOD increases each year. However, we can also see a slight increasing tendency as the MISR AOD increases from 0.15 to 0.55 in 2005 and in 2006, although we can derive an overall decreasing tendency of TOA LW as the AOD increases. The reason for this phenomenon is not clear because information about atmospheric and surface conditions besides dust loading is very limited. The DREF LW also varies from year to year. The largest DREF LW , ∼39 W m −2 , occurs in 2004 when the expected TOA LW flux without dust is also the largest, 346 W m −2 . The minimum DREF LW is ∼18 W m −2 , which occurs in 2006 when TOA LW without dust is relatively lower. TOA LW is determined by the surface skin temperature under the same atmospheric conditions. More TOA LW without dust, to a large extent, means higher surface skin temperature. Therefore, the year-to-year change in DREF LW is, to some extent, associated with variation in surface skin temperature. However, this is still a guess, further research on this issue is required to fully understand impacts of surface property on dust forcing.Same as that of Figure 1 but for the collocated data points of the MISR AOD and CERES LW flux every year from 2001 to 2006.. While the dust LW forcing is continuous, it varies instead with atmospheric and surface emissivity and thermal structure. The dust LW forcing during nighttime is expected to be less than that during daytime. This is first because the higher surface skin temperature during daytime leads to larger forcing efficiency. The second reason is that the stronger vertical motion of the atmosphere during daytime can transport dust to higher levels, thereby leading to larger forcing efficiency. Both factors would lead to a larger DREF LW during daytime than during nighttime, so one would expect the diurnal-mean DREF LW would be smaller than 28.4 W m −2 . The overall radiative effect of Taklimakan dust is thus to cool Earth's system.. Dust scattering leads to an increase of TOA SW flux by 21 W m −2 in the Taklimakan Desert. However, the dust SW forcing at the TOA in the African and Arabian Desert is very small. A potential reason for this difference is likely due to the relatively lower surface albedo in the Taklimakan Desert. The satellite observations of aerosol and radiation, if supplemented by the surface observations of downward and upward SW and LW, can be used together to derive aerosol forcing not only to space, but also at the surface and in the atmosphere.[14]  Dust radiative effects on TOA SW and LW flux are estimated over the Taklimakan Desert by merging the MISR AOD and CERES SSF flux at the TOA. The current study clearly shows the reflected SW flux to space tends to increase whereas the emitted LW flux at the TOA tends to decrease as the dust loading increases, both over the cloud free Taklimakan desert regions in May. The regional mean dust SW and LW forcing efficiencies at 05:00 UTC are −48.1 and 28.4 W m −2 . This indicates that dust instantaneous LW warming effect can offset 58% of dust instantaneous SW cooling effect. The overall radiative effect of Taklimakan dust is still to cool Earth's system even when the diurnal variation of SW and LW forcing is considered."
105,aerosol,"Two contrasting dust-dominant periods over India observed from MODIS and CALIPSO data. Each year, prior to the onset of the Indian Summer Monsoon, the Gangetic Plains GP , bounded by the high-altitude Himalayan mountains, are strongly influenced by the transport of dust outbreaks originating in the northwestern desert in India known as the Thar Desert . Dust particles constitute the bulk of the regional aerosol loading which peaks annually during the pre-monsoon season. This paper integrates observations from space-borne sensors, namely MODIS and CALIPSO, together with ground sunphotometer measurements, to infer dust loading in the pre-monsoon aerosol build-up over source and sink regions in northern India. Detailed aerosol characterization from the synergetic observational assessment suggests that the two pre-monsoon seasons of 2007 and 2008 were strikingly contrasting in terms of the dust loading over both the Thar Desert and the GP. Further analysis of aerosol loading and optical properties, from the entire record of MODIS and sunphotometer observations, reveals that the 2007 pre-monsoon season was an unusually weak dust-laden period. Our findings suggest the plausible role of the immediately preceding excess winter monsoon rainfall in the suppressed dust activity during the 2007 pre-monsoon season. Citation:Gautam, R., Z. Liu, R. P. Singh, and N. C. Hsu 2009 , Two contrasting dust-dominant periods over India observed from MODIS and CALIPSO data, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L06813, doi:10.1029/2008GL036967. . Mineral dusts are a major contributor to the aerosol loading in the troposphere influencing the seasonal variability of the aerosol optical properties and the regional-to-global radiative forcing. Through their influence on cloud microphysical properties and cloud lifetime as well as perturbations to the radiative energy balance, recent studies suggest that mineral dust may also potentially induce changes in the global hydrological cycle, especially over the Indian subcontinent which receives the bulk of the annual precipitation during the summer monsoon season.. Dust activity starts in March–April and peaks in May, i.e., prior to the onset of the Indian Summer Monsoon with strong pre-monsoon westerly winds transporting dust particles into the alluvium of the densely-populated Gangetic Plains GP . The towering Himalayas form a barrier to the passage of dust storms, resulting in the accumulation of dusts, largely over the foothills of the Himalayas and the GP. As a result, the atmospheric column aerosol loading during the pre-monsoon season is highest over the GP on an annual basis combined with the heavy anthropogenic pollution concentrated over this region. Although detailed studies of the influence of enhanced dust loading have been carried out, however they have been restricted to a single point location in the GP using ground radiometric measurements. Further, the inter-annual variations of the contribution of dust to the net atmospheric aerosol loading over the source as well as over the transported regions in the GP are not well understood.. However, the C005 algorithm follows a dark-target approach retrieving aerosols over vegetated and oceanic surface with gaps over bright surfaces such as deserts. Therefore, in addition to the C005 aerosol product, we utilize aerosol loading information derived from the MODIS Deep Blue algorithm which retrieves global aerosol information over land including bright surfaces. The pixel size of the Level-2 MODIS swath AOD products is 10*10 km. These datasets were binned into a quarter degree uniform spatial resolution grid and were finally averaged to represent the composite aerosol loading over the Indian subcontinent.. We use the Level 2 version 2.01 data product consisting of optical and physical properties of the detected aerosol layers. In addition to the standard AOD retrieval, we have further applied a data filtering criteria C. Kittaka et al., Intercomparison of the CALIPSO and MODIS aerosol optical depth, manuscript in preparation, 2009 to screen out some low confident retrievals, during heavy aerosol loading conditions optical depths > 2 and/or when large uncertainties due to noise and incorrect correction for the attenuation of overlying layers may exist. This is alleviated by adjusting the lidar ratio or, extinction to backscatter ratio during the retrieval to maintain the retrieval stability and also by screening out profiles that have an anomalous high Integrated Attenuated Backscatter value. Along with space-borne observations, we also use ground measurements of aerosol properties from a CIMEL sunphotometer over Kanpur in central GP, as part of the Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET project. Detailed analysis of aerosol optical properties in central GP shows significant influence of coarse-mode particles in the enhanced aerosol loading in MAM08. Majority of aerosol measurements in MAM08 are associated with angstrom exponent α , which is a first-order indicator of the size of aerosol less than 0.5, while on the other hand, MAM07 is dominated by fine-mode aerosols with α often greater than 0.6 and about 35% of the entire MAM07 sample associated with values greater than 0.8 Figure S1 . Mean α during MAM08 and May 2008 is found to be 0.4 0.5 compared to higher values of 0.7 0.8 during 2007. Also, the spectral behavior of AOD during the pre-monsoon season of 2008 appears to be relatively flat in nature with ∼25% increase in AOD at 870 nm and 1020 nm, suggesting greater extinction of light at longer wavelengths due to higher concentration of coarse particles, compared to the 2007 pre-monsoon season. The present study also utilizes CALIPSO lidar observations, compiled over India, to characterize the pre-monsoon aerosol variations in the two years. Since the western part of India is influenced by greater dust contribution, we restricted our analysis to the 70–85°E area to focus on the dust source and transport. Latitudinal mean AOD from CALIPSO indicates ∼40% increase in aerosol loading over northern India during MAM08 compared to 2007 Figure 3 . Again, this difference is underscored during the peak dust activity month of May, during when the mean AOD over northern India is about 1 in 2008 compared to the mean value of 0.6 in 2007.Latitudinal profile of mean aerosol optical depth over India, restricted within 70–85°E, during a MAM 2007 and b MAM 2008 using CALIPSO aerosol layer product with depolarization ratios separated in four bins indicated by different shades in the vertical bars.. VDR is indicative of the type of particles and can be effectively used to discriminate spherical aerosols such as sulfate with non-spherical such as dust particles. The VDR is defined as the ratio of the perpendicular and parallel components of the attenuated backscatter signal. Higher VDR suggests greater amount of non-spherical particles in cloud-free conditions . Although smoke and pollution aerosols contain non-spherical soot particles, the depolarization ratio for these aerosol types is normally small because of the small size of the soot particles. The VDR values from CALIPSO for smoke aerosols over central and southern Africa are generally smaller than 6% with a typical value of 2–3%. In the six-year record of aerosol retrievals over bright surfaces, beginning in 2003 from the Aqua MODIS Deep Blue aerosol product, we find that the MAM07 AOD is significantly lower over the Thar Desert compared to previous individual years as well 45% drop in MAM07 AOD relative to the mean value for MAM 2003–2006 Figure 4 . The significant reduction in dust loading is also observed in the GP as suggested by the high value of angstrom exponent 0.74 during the 2007 pre-monsoon season Figure 4 which is found to be most pronounced in May. The angstrom exponent during May 2007 is 0.78 suggesting dominance of fine-mode particles , whereas other individual years, since 2001, are characterized by low values in the range of 0.2–0.5. In addition, the size distribution parameter, averaged during May 2001–2006, also indicates significantly higher value coarse-mode peaking at 0.37 μ m 3 / μ m 2 which is close to that of 2008 compared to the exceptionally lower value of 0.08 μ m 3 / μ m 2 during 2007. Our study based on detailed characterization of aerosols and their inter-annual variations over the source region, i.e., the Thar Desert as well as over the GP, suggests an unusually weak dust-laden pre-monsoon season during 2007.Inter-annual variations of the mean AOD vertical bars in MAM over the Thar Desert from Aqua MODIS Deep Blue product, Angstrom Exponent in MAM from 2001 to 2008 obtained from sunphotometer measurements in central GP black dots , and winter DJF Rainfall over the Thar Desert from 2001 to 2008 dashed line .. Heavy rainfall results in the increase of soil moisture thereby reducing dust emissions over source regions. Over India, the summer monsoon rainfall June–September accounts for over 70% of the annual precipitation, while the winter monsoon also known as the retreat of the southwest summer monsoon contributes very little to the annual rainfall during December–January–February DJF . Our literature survey indicates that the present study is one of the first to examine the possible role of winter rainfall in influencing the immediately following dust activity over India, especially over the northern subcontinent including the dust source region. In addition to their strong influence on aerosol optical properties, dust transport over the GP significantly affects regional air quality, therefore the relationship between winter rainfall and spring dust seasons should be further investigated for reliable model forecasting of dust emissions as well. Through the integrated approach of using MODIS, CALIPSO and ground measurements, our study highlights the synergetic characterization of mineral dust in the tropospheric aerosol burden. Due to their solar absorption effects in altering the Earth's radiation budget and potentially the hydrological cycle as well, it is thus imperative to continuously monitor dust aerosols over source and sink regions in order to better understand their spatio-temporal variability from satellite and ground observations."
106,particles clouds,"Heterogeneous ice nucleation measurements of secondary organic aerosol generated from ozonolysis of alkenes. Ice nuclei IN are those particles which catalyze ice nucleation in the atmosphere. Ambient measurements suggest that the main particle types that function as IN are metal oxides and dust. However, carbonaceous particles often are the next most abundant IN particle type, although the source and exact chemical compositions of these particles are unknown. Here we explore the ice nucleating ability of one potential source of carbonaceous IN to the atmosphere, secondary organic aerosol SOA . We generated SOA by ozonolysis of 25 different organic precursors in the presence of an OH scavenger. For all experiments, ice nucleation was not observed in detectable quantities. We conclude that SOA generated from ozonolysis of alkenes is an unlikely source of IN to the atmosphere. Citation: Prenni, A.J., M.D. Petters, A. Faulhaber, C.M. Carrico, P.J. Ziemann, S. M. Kreidenweis, and P.J. DeMott 2009 , Heterogeneous ice nucleation measurements of secondary organic aerosol generated from ozonolysis of alkenes, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L06808, doi:10.1029/2008GL036957. , in which changes in the number of particles which nucleate ice can alter precipitation and impact the radiative properties of clouds. Ice formation in the atmosphere occurs via homogeneous freezing involving aerosol with hygroscopic components, heterogeneous ice nucleation processes involving certain insoluble particles, and secondary processes initiated by pre-existing ice particles. At temperatures warmer than −36°C, primary ice formation can only occur by heterogeneous nucleation on some insoluble aerosol component, termed an ice nucleus IN . Only a tiny fraction of particles serve as IN in the atmosphere, typically on the order of 1 in 10 5 , although IN number concentrations can vary dramatically both spatially and temporally.. Contributions from soot and organic species have also been reported, with carbonaceous particles making up a significant fraction of ambient IN see Table 1 . However, organic compounds also have been shown to be anti-correlated with ice formation in atmospheric clouds presumably influenced by heterogeneous ice nucleation, and laboratory studies at cirrus temperatures have shown that condensation of secondary organic aerosol SOA from ozonolysis of. Carbonaceous fraction shown for organic + sulfate category.. Limited to sub-micrometer IN, and results are by mass. For most of the studies listed in Table 1 , the source and composition of the carbonaceous particles are unknown. In some cases, particle morphology gives a clue as to the nature of the carbonaceous material. For example, soot has a very distinct structure which can be identified using transmission electron microscopy TEM . Certain biological particles also have shown ice nucleating behavior, although identification based on their morphology from TEM is tenuous. TEM images of four carbonaceous IN collected as part of the Amazonian Aerosol Characterization Experiment 2008 AMAZE-08 are shown in Figure 1 . These particles were collected during the wet season, and so are not thought to be biomass burning particles. Figures 1a and 1b represent carbonaceous particles with some well-defined structure, with the rodlike structure in Figure 1a potentially representing a bacterium. Only ∼10% of the particles had similar defined structures for the AMAZE-08 study. Most carbonaceous IN, ∼70%, were irregularly shaped, as in Figure 1c . Such a shape may be expected for leaf litter, or may result if the particle breaks down during freezing in the instrument. The remaining ∼20% of carbonaceous IN observed during AMAZE-08 were spherical, as in Figure 1d . These particles likely have a biogenic source, with the shape consistent with a virus 0.1 μ m < D < 0.5 μ m or SOA.Transmission electron microscopy images of ambient carbonaceous particles which served as ice nuclei, collected during the AMAZE-08 field campaign., C O OH, and C-O-C have shown ice nucleating ability. SOA is formed by the addition of these groups to volatile hydrocarbon precursors, and thus some compounds present in SOA may also serve as effective ice nuclei. An increase in oxygenation of the particles may also increase particle hygroscopicity, which may reduce their ability to nucleate ice. However, measurements of hygroscopicity during this study unpublished suggest that the hygroscopicity parameter, κ, ranged from κ = 0 non-hygroscopic to κ = 0.1 for the systems studied, and recent measurements suggest that hygroscopic SOA likely contains both water soluble and insoluble components. The net impact of increasing functional groups on organic compounds with regard to ice nucleation, where these competing factors are not well quantified, is not known. Rosinski and Parungo . Clean air was then flushed through a glass bulb containing 1.5 to 6 μ L of the precursor organic compound, depending on the expected aerosol yield, and into the chamber. A summary of all of the systems investigated in this study is given in Table 2 . For the reactions of linear alkenes with O 3 , 30 ppm of either methanol or propanol also was added in the same manner to scavenge stabilized Criegee intermediates SCI formed in the O 3 reaction. SCI reaction products dominate the SOA formed from reactions of linear alkenes, so adding the alcohol leads to SOA that is comprised almost entirely of aliphatic α -alkoxyhydroperoxides, rather than a mixture of other less well characterized products. We note that the use of scavengers and the relatively high concentrations of the precursors are both expected to impact SOA composition, and so the resulting aerosol is not completely representative of ambient particles. Finally, 10 ppm ozone was added to the chamber, and after a short delay, particles formed. Precursor molecules included monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, cyclic alkenes, substituted cyclic alkenes and linear alkenes. Ozonolysis of these compounds leads to an array of multifunctional products containing various combinations of carbonyl, hydroxy, carboxyl, hydroxperoxy, and peroxy groups. Finally, photolysis of diodomethane in the presence of ozone was explored, to examine the potential IN activity of the resulting iodine oxides.Except for measurements including iodine, the chamber included cyclohexane to scavenge OH and β -caryophyllene to form seed particles. In all cases, the chamber also included O 3 .. At the outlet, size distributions are measured using the OPC, which serves as the basis for determining IN concentrations, with particles >2 μ m identified as ice crystals. An inlet impactor upstream of the CFDC ensures that aerosol particles larger than ∼1.3 μ m are removed prior to entering the instrument. The CFDC is sensitive to deposition nucleation and condensation and immersion freezing. Contact freezing is not measured, but laboratory studies suggest that contact nucleation typically occurs at temperatures 4–5°C warmer than immersion freezing. For this study, the aerosol was exposed to −30°C and water supersaturation. At these conditions, most IN which can impact ice formation in mixed-phase clouds are expected to nucleate., and these particles are significantly smaller than the carbonaceous IN observed during AMAZE-08 ≈ 500 nm . For all concentrations, there is sufficient water vapor in the CFDC for the particles to grow as droplets. However, for number concentrations exceeding ∼30,000 cm −3 , ice growth will be vapor limited. Nonetheless, there is sufficient water vapor available to observe ice nucleation onset, up to 5% of all particles, even for the highest number concentrations., and ozonolysis of cyclopentene in the presence of iodine vapor.CFDC signal for filtered air, ambient air in Riverside, CA, and the SOA system of heptadecene + O 3 + methanol + β -caryophyllene + cyclohexane. These data suggest that SOA formed by the ozonolysis of alkenes is unlikely to participate in heterogeneous ice nucleation in the atmosphere. To our knowledge these are the first direct measurements of the ice nucleating ability of pure SOA particles. However, we note that the composition of SOA formed at mass concentrations near ambient conditions or which forms in the presence of additional species such as NO x is expected to differ from the particles described here, and may exhibit different ice nucleation behavior. Future studies are planned to build upon this work to explore the multitude of potential SOA products as IN."
122,aerosol,"Vertical and spatial distribution of dust from aircraft and satellite measurements during the GERBILS field campaign. The Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget Intercomparisons of Longwave and Shortwave GERBILS radiation field experiment was conducted in June 2007 over North Africa to study dust aerosols from aircraft, satellite, and ground measurements. We present results from a case study on June 21, 2007 where coincident measurements from a space borne lidar, aircraft profiles, and multiple satellite instruments from the A-Train are available around 1430 UTC. Backscatter measurements from the space-borne lidar indicate that dust aerosols are present between the surface and altitudes of 4-6 km, which agrees well with aircraft measurements. For low AOD AOD 1 , the agreement between satellite and aircraft-derived values and amongst the satellite products are within 0.1 - 0.2. However, most satellite products underestimate AOD when aircraft AOD's are higher AOD > 1 . New satellite sensors coupled with new algorithms are now providing valuable information over desert regions to assess aerosol impacts on climate, air quality and other applications. Citation: Christopher, S. A., B. Johnson, T. A. Jones, and J. Haywood 2009 , Vertical and spatial distribution of dust from aircraft and satellite measurements during the GERBILS field campaign, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L06806, doi: 10.1029/2008GL037033. . However, further understanding of these processes is needed and is being addressed through a combination of in-situ aircraft and ground-based , satellite, and modelling studies. A renewed focus on dust aerosol research over North Africa through field experiments and advances in satellite remote sensing has increased our understanding of dust aerosol properties and their effects. Multi-spectral satellite remote sensing techniques, without multi-angle or polarization capabilities, have traditionally experienced difficulties in estimating aerosol concentrations over regions of high surface reflectance in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum such as deserts. However, there have been significant advancements in techniques over the last few years that have enabled development of new satellite products over these surfaces. These now allow mapping of aerosols from space, identification of dust sources, quantification of aerosol properties such as dust absorption, and measurement of the vertical distribution of aerosols and clouds. Such tasks are all important for furthering our understanding of how dust aerosols affect climate.. Currently, there are several hundred AERONET stations worldwide with more than a dozen located in North Africa. Hourly values of AOD and daily retrievals of aerosol optical properties from the AERONET are routinely made available to the worldwide community for validating satellite retrievals and assessing aerosol-climate impacts. and other methods that use the ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum now allow mapping of dust aerosols from space over desert regions. Aerosol properties such as AOT and single scattering albedo are being retrieved from these sensors. Furthermore, the vertical distribution of aerosols can now be assessed for space-borne lidars, such as CALIPSO, providing improved capabilities for assessing the impact of dust aerosols on the earth-atmosphere system. Several satellite data sets and products are used in this study. Only a brief summary of the various satellite algorithms and their limitations are presented. These algorithms report uncertainties in their retrievals by using AERONET as a benchmark. More complete descriptions are provided by references herein. The MODIS operational collection 5 algorithm on Terra and Aqua provides global distribution of aerosols, but not over bright surfaces such as deserts. The reported uncertainty over non bright targets is ±0.05 ± 0.15 τ . The MODIS Deep Blue algorithm primarily uses the UV channels to provide aerosol retrievals over deserts and other areas where the operational algorithm cannot and the reported uncertainties are around 25 to 30%. The OMI instrument on the Aura satellite provides aerosol index that is then converted to AOD using AOD-AI relationships that is called EAOD. Limited intercomparisons for Saharan desert dust aerosols show that the EAOD's are within 30% of the AERONET values. OMI has two aerosol products, one OMAERO that uses a two channel 360 and 380 nm algorithm and the other OMAERUV a multi-spectral 19 wavelengths between 330–500 nm algorithm. The reported uncertainties in the OMAERO and the OMAERUV AOT are around 30%. The MISR instrument on Terra utilizes its multi-angle capabilities to provide AOD retrievals over the whole earth without limitations to surface and is becoming the benchmark for aerosol retrievals over bright desert surfaces. Validation studies show that when compared with the AERONET, more than 2/3 of the MISR values are within 20% and 1/3 of the pixels are within 10% of the AOT values type. Note that the Terra satellite has an overpass time roughly three hours prior to the A-Train constellation of satellites that are used in this study. The SEVIRI is a multi spectral instrument on the METOESAT second generation geostationary satellite and provides high temporal resolution measurements. The brightness temperature difference BTD between the 11 and 12 μ m are typically used to identify dust aerosols. The CALIOP, an active lidar on the CALIPSO satellite, provides vertical profile of backscatter at 532 and 1064 nm both during day and night and samples the vertical distribution of clouds and aerosols over desert regions. Only the level 1 backscatter information is used in this study since the AOD retrievals from CALIOP are currently undergoing refinement and validation.. In this study, the vertical profile of the aerosol scattering coefficient measured by the aircraft nephelometer is used to assess the altitude of aerosol layers and estimate the total column AOD and the reported uncertainty is around 20%. A complete analysis of the GERBILS data sets including modelling analysis is currently underway by various members of the GERBILS science team.Satellite and aircraft analysis for June 21, 2007, a Merged Aqua MODIS, Level 1B visible reflectances show clouds in white, Aqua MODIS Collection 5 AOD over ocean areas and dark targets and Aqua MODIS Deep Blue AOD over high surface reflectance regions.

To gain some insight on the effects of atmospheric conditions, horizontal wind speed, direction and vertical velocity at 700 hPa from NCEP reanalysis are included with Figure 1b . Clearly evident are strong southwestward winds extending from 5°W westward into the Atlantic Ocean surrounding a high-pressure system centered near 20°W, 20°N. The center corresponds to a region of sinking air, indicated by the red contours. The easterly winds transport dust from the deserts of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean and finally northward on the western side of the high pressure. Upward vertical motion blue contours is maximized northeast of Dakar, near dust source regions. The synoptic-scale upward motion allows for the transport of the dust near the surface upwards into the mid-levels of the atmosphere. The strong surface heating over land drives strong dry convection which leads to the development of an extremely deep dust-laden boundary layer extending to altitudes of greater than 6 km.. In Figure 1c , the high CALIPSO backscatter shown in red indicates a broad area of dust between 10–15°N. This corresponds well with the negative BTD between 10–15°N. This dust plume is strongest between altitudes of 4–6 km although it is not confined exclusively to that altitude range , which is confirmed by the corresponding vertical distribution of aerosol extinction at 13.34°N derived from the BAE-146 nephelometer measurements Figure 1d . The EAOD derived from the OMI and MISR shown in green also shows high AOD's over this area between 10–15°N. The MODIS, MISR, and EAOD's are all consistent between 12–15°N when all three retrievals are available. Between 10–12°N only EAOT values are available whereas the MODIS and MISR have no retrievals. Note that the MISR overpass occurs 3 hours prior to the A-Train overpass and therefore such differences are possible due to several reasons including meteorology and algorithm inconsistencies. There also appears to be no MODIS AOD retrievals between 10–12°N and a visual inspection of Figure 1a indicates that this is possibly due to highly reflective dust in some pixels being mis-diagnosed as clouds. Optically thick aerosol plumes could be classified as clouds or rejected from the AOD retrieval process as this is a limitation of some satellite algorithms. Figure 2 compares various satellite products from a region centred along and approximately 50 km 2 around the flight path of the BAE-146 on June 21, 2007, as indicated by the yellow line in Figure 1b from Niamey to Noukachott. Note that all satellite values are from approximately 1440 UTC except those from MISR that are about 3 hours prior to the A-Train overpass. Also indicated on Figure 2 in black squares are the four AOD estimates derived from aircraft profiles. These values are all reported for a wavelength of around 550 nm. The aircraft started measurements just east of 0° longitude at around 1000 UTC and ended in Nouakchott around 1450 UTC. The missing data around 5°W is largely due to gaps in orbital swaths refer to Figure 1a . The trends in AOD among all the products are remarkably similar along the flight track. However, the magnitudes differ at several points along the flight track. Note that such intercomparisons between aircraft and satellite data sets are extremely challenging since the satellite provides snapshots in space and time over large 2-D footprints 10–30 km 2 whereas aircraft AODs from profile ascents/descents are essentially 1-D averages over a horizontal track of about 100 km. Nevertheless, at the start of the flight, for profile P1 1.6°E , the aircraft AOD's is 0.3 and the mean and standard deviation among the various satellite products is 0.46 ± 0.15 that is within the retrieval uncertainties. For profiles P2 8.5°W and P3–P8 11.9°W the aircraft AOD values are 2.32 and 1.67 respectively. Only the OMAERUV captures these high values and the other satellite products are lower by about 0.5. This is possibly due to the high reflectivity pixels that are possibly being classified as clouds and/or are screened out of the retrieval process. Near P2, we examined the MODIS 11–12 um differences BTD for the flight track along with the 412, 490 and 670 nm reflectances not shown . The values indicate negative BTD consistent with dust aerosol signatures and high 670 nm reflectances indicative of optically thick aerosols. Finally for profile P9, where the aircraft AOD was 0.685, the mean and standard deviation among satellite products are 0.62 ± 0.17.AOD from various satellite products along the aircraft flight path for June 21, 2007 the mean AOD corresponding to the flight profile and the standard deviation among the satellite AOD's are also shown. MODIS 11–12 mm data are also plotted, with negative values indicating regions of greatest dust concentrations. Shown in black squares are the AOD values retrieved from the profiles made by the BAE-146.[11]  Until recently, quantitative aerosol information from satellites was scarce over North Africa, especially over the highly reflective Sahara desert. Although the MISR instrument on Terra has been providing reliable aerosol retrievals over deserts, the swath width of the MISR is too narrow to provide daily coverage. Newly launched satellite instruments e.g., OMI and CALIPSO coupled with improvements in satellite algorithms are now beginning to provide much needed information over the deserts. Aerosol properties such as AOD are now available over desert regions from multiple sensors. Several efforts are underway to assess the accuracy of these satellite retrievals. We used multiple satellite sensors and aircraft measurements to assess some of the current capabilities. Spatial distributions are now routinely available from MODIS, MISR, and OMI and vertical distributions of dust can also be obtained from CALIPSO. Aircraft measurements from field campaigns, such as the GERBILS experiment, provide valuable information that will help refine such satellite algorithms. Results from these case studies indicate that the satellite and aircraft derived dust aerosol heights are consistent. There are differences between aircraft and satellite AOD owing to the very different spatial and temporal sampling of aircraft and satellite retrievals. There are also differences among satellite products, but these are to be expected since these products are relatively new and are undergoing refinement. For AOD < 1 there appears to be consistency among satellite products and aircraft estimates and are well within the uncertainty estimates. However, for AOD > 1 as derived from the aircraft most satellite algorithms have lower AOD's than the aircraft, possibly due to aerosol-cloud identification issues that requires further investigation. Finally, we note that this research only represents a single case study day, which is a limitation, but complete analysis of the GERBILS satellite, ground, and aircraft data sets are underway and promise to further our understanding of dust aerosols."
123,dust,"Electrification of wind-blown sand on Mars and its implications for atmospheric chemistry. Wind-blown sand, or 'saltation,' creates sand dunes, erodes geological features, and could be a significant source of dust aerosols on Mars. Moreover, the electrification of sand and dust in saltation, dust storms, and dust devils could produce electric discharges and affect atmospheric chemistry. We present the first calculations of electric fields in martian saltation, using a numerical model of saltation that includes sand electrification, plasma physics, and the adsorption of ions and electrons onto particulates. Our results indicate that electric discharges do not occur in martian saltation. Moreover, we find that the production of hydrogen peroxide and the dissociation of methane by electric fields are less significant than previously thought. Both these species are highly relevant to studies of past and present life on Mars. Citation: Kok, J. F., and N. O. Renno 2009 , Electrification of wind-blown sand on Mars and its implications for atmospheric chemistry, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L05202, doi: 10.1029/2008GL036691. . Moreover, the impact of saltating sand particles on the ground ejects dust aerosols into the atmosphere on both Earth and Mars, which greatly affects the climate of both planets.. These large. and report the first calculations of, and is the normalized cross section for a collision occurring between an electron and a saltating sand particle. Since the sand particles are strongly negatively charged, we have < 1, following . This electron population becomes increasingly energetic as the., the E -field in martian saltation peaks at the surface and decreases monotonically with height inset of Figure 1 . On Mars, the rate of decrease of the E -field with height is less than on Earth because the smaller gravitational and aerodynamic drag forces cause the saltation layer to be thicker there.Simulated average E -field between the anode the surface and the cathode z cat ≈ 30 cm in Martian saltation as a function of wind shear velocity, u * = , where τ is the wind shear stress directly above the saltation layer and ρ a is atmospheric density. The inset shows the vertical profile of the E -field for a wind shear velocity of 2.5 m/s. The results are obtained with the numerical model of saltation described by Kok and Renno  As expected, the E -field in the saltation layer increases with wind speed Figure 1 . The resulting increasingly energetic electron population starts dissociating CO 2 i.e., e + CO 2 → CO + O − at a few kV/m and ionizing CO 2 i.e., e + CO 2 → 2 e + CO 2 + at ∼10 kV/m. The resulting increase in the concentration of ions and electrons with the E -field Figure 2 enhances the atmospheric conductivity, which neutralizes the charges on saltating particles and the surface see Eq. 3 , thereby limiting further increases in the E -field. Indeed, we find that this negative feedback limits the E -field in martian saltation to ∼15–20 kV/m. This upper limit on the E -field in martian saltation is relatively insensitive to uncertainties in model parameters and the model methodology, because of the sharp dependence of the production rate of ions on the E -field., thereby increasing the charge relaxation time and thus the E -field. Finally, large-scale discharges in dust storms could occur at a lower E -field than predicted by the Paschen law equation 1 through electron runaway breakdown.. While we here indeed find that the E -field in saltation can exceed 10 kV/m for large wind speeds, we also find that the concentration of ions and electrons at such E -fields is much smaller than suggested by these previous studies Figure 2 . The difference occurs because we expanded on these previous studies and accounted for losses of ions and electrons due to adsorption to saltating sand and the soil surface, as well as the loss of electrons from dissociative attachment to CO 2 . A separate calculation shows that the large concentration of electrons and ions predicted by following these previous studies are unlikely to occur in saltation or dust storms, because the large conductivity of the resulting plasma limits the E -field to values well below those necessary to maintain the plasma Figure 3 . Indeed, the charging current necessary to maintain these plasma conditions is several orders of magnitude larger than that produced by saltation Figure 3 . Since saltation probably plays a key role in charge generation in dust storms and dust devils, we expect the charging current in these phenomena to be of similar magnitude as in saltation. We therefore conclude that the concentration of ions and electrons in martian wind-blown sand, dust devils, and dust storms, is much smaller than previously suggested. The production of hydrogen peroxide and the dissociation of methane by E -fields in these phenomena are thus probably less significant than previously thought.Simulated concentration of electrons left axis and red lines and the enhancement of the ion concentration over the background concentration n −,0 = n +,0 = 3 × 10 9 m 3 ; right axis and blue lines as a function of the average E -field between the anode and the cathode. Solid lines with circles indicate results from our numerical saltation model for which the anode is at the surface and the cathode is at the height z cat see text . For E -fields of ∼5–12 kV/m, the electron concentration decreases because of dissociative attachment to CO 2 and adsorption to sand particles, whereas for larger E -fields the electron concentration increases due to the generation of additional electrons through ionization of CO 2 . Dashed lines indicate electron and ion concentrations calculated for a homogenous E -field over a length of 0.5 m following and. That is, we use equations 4 and 5 to calculate the ion and electron concentrations, but neglect the terms in these equations that account for losses of electrons and the loss of ions to the soil surface.Simulated charge relaxation time left axis and black lines and charge separation current I = σE required to sustain the E -field right axis and blue line against the relaxation of charge on saltating particles and the surface, as a function of the average E -field between the anode and the cathode.

Dashed lines indicate results following and, as described in the caption of Figure 2 .. Indeed, we find that the plasma in which these reactions occur cannot be sustained because its large conductivity limits the E -field to values well below that necessary to maintain the plasma Figure 3 . Nonetheless, the concept of electro-chemical production of oxidants in martian saltation and dust storms, possibly through electric discharges, remains a possible explanation for the puzzling absence of organics from the martian soil and should be investigated further."
124,dust climate,"Impact of aerosol on sea surface temperature over the subtropical Atlantic Ocean: A potential trigger factor of the NAO phase conversion?. The North Atlantic Oscillation NAO is one of the most prominent patterns of atmospheric circulation variability over the Northern hemisphere, yet little is known about its underlying mechanism of phase conversion. Our analysis reveals that the recent decline of Aerosol Optical Depth AOD over the Subtropical Atlantic Ocean SAO contributes significantly to the enhancement of SAO Sea Surface Temperature SST . We further show that the aerosol variations over SAO appear to be a trigger factor of NAO phase conversion. A new conceptual model, which details for the first time the atmospheric thermodynamic and dynamic anomaly structures during positive and negative NAO phase, has been presented here to illustrate the impact of aerosol on the SST over the SAO and the atmospheric response of the NAO. Citation: Luo, G., F. Yu, and Z. Wang 2009 , Impact of aerosol on sea surface temperature over the subtropical Atlantic Ocean: A potential trigger factor of the NAO phase conversion?, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L03708, doi: 10.1029/2008GL036035. . The possible contributions or responses of NAO to Atlantic and Arctic climate change are still under discussing. It has long been recognized that the fluctuations in SST and the climate change over the North Atlantic are related. However, the evidences from theoretical and modeling studies suggest that mid-latitude SST anomalies have only a weak impact on the NAO, and some studies conclude that the basic structure of the NAO mainly arises from the internal and nonlinear dynamics of the atmosphere. While the theory based on atmospheric internal dynamics successfully explained the high-frequency variability of the NAO, it has difficulty to explain the inter-annual change and the decadal trend of the NAO structure. A number of researches show that the ocean forcing, as a dominant external factor, is very important to the variation of the NAO.  Satellite retrievals and ground-based measurements have shown tremendous changes in global concentrations and distributions of aerosol. The global mean direct aerosol radiative effect has been estimated to be around −0.5 ± 0.33 W m –2 from satellite remote sensing studies and −0.46 ± 0.20 W m –2 based on model simulations. The historical AOD data from AVHRR indicates a maximum loading of aerosols over the African continent downwind regions, which are mainly from the Saharan desert dust deflations and Congo rainforest open fire burning Figure 1a . The AOD of dense aerosol hazes covering huge areas of the SAO is about 2 times of the global mean 0.14 and is much higher than that over other oceanic regions. More importantly, the linear trend analysis of AVHRR data Figure 1b suggests a significant decline of AOD over the downwind region of Africa during the period. The decreased AOD over this region is likely associated with the condition of African droughts and rainfall in the Sudan-Sahel. a 10-year 1986–2005 average of AVHRR Aerosol Optical Depth AOD at 550 nm, b AOD annual linear trend during the period 1986~2005, c the linear regression of SST and the NAO annual Indices, and d the linear regression of SST and geopotential height at 1000 hPa. The SSTs for the regression come from the NOAA Optimum Interpolation OI Sea Surface Temperature V2 anomaly, which is produced by the observations from buoys, ships and satellites. The NAO indices are from the CAS Data Catalog's Annual PC Based NAO Index. The geopotential height at 1000 hPa is from the NCEP reanalysis database.  Figure 1c reveals a tripole pattern of SST and the NAO correlation over the North Atlantic sector. The distinct negative correlation signal can be found over the SAO with the value high up to −0.6, implicating that the atmosphere-ocean interaction over the region is very strong. The regression analysis of SST and the geopotential height at 1000 hPa Figure 1d shows a positive correlation located over mid-latitude Atlantic Ocean and a negative correlation located over the SAO. This suggests that the SST variations over the Azores High and the Icelandic Low are mainly a response to the fluctuation of the NAO; but at the SAO, the atmospheric pattern is changed by the SST. Therefore, the variations of SST over the SAO appear to be forced by some other factors. Our investigation of the relations between monthly SST and the NAO annual indices indicates that the negative correlation is strengthened over the SAO from March to June shown in the auxiliary material , and the negative correlation region matched well with the African dust outflow over the continent downwind region Figure 1a . A logical and natural explanation of the phenomenon described above is that African aerosol may contribute to the NAO variation through its radiative forcing and impact on SST., Cloud Optical Depth COD and Surface Wind Speed SWS Figures 2b left – 2e left . It is clear that SST and the above mentioned external and internal factors is highly anti-correlated and the correlation coefficients reach up to −0.77, −0.52 and −0.72, respectively. Solar radiation, wind stress and vertical mixing are known to be the three major factors impacting the SST seasonal variations and abrupt changes. Solar radiation is the primary heating term in the surface layer heat budget, and wind stress influences SST by driving oceanic advective processes that redistribute heat in the upper ocean. Both terms also impact the SST through their influences on oceanic vertical mixing. It is well recognized that atmospheric aerosols affect solar radiation. Even in the absence of volcanic eruptions, high concentrations of tropospheric aerosols such as dust carried from African deserts have been shown to reduce solar radiation by up to 2.2 W m −2 and cause cooling of subtropical Atlantic SST. In addition, aerosol can also affect cloud droplet radius and shallow water clouds over the Atlantic Ocean. . left Time series of annual OIv2 SST anomaly red, K , AOD blue for AVHRR and cyan for TOMS, 550 nm wavelength, unitless , ISCCP D2 Cloud Optical Depth COD anomaly orange, 600 nm, unitless , NCEP Reanalysis Surface Wind Speed anomaly green, m·s −1 at the sensitive region 20∼40°W, 10∼20°N .

The corresponding values averaged zonally over the global oceans are also given in each panel grey lines for comparison. We have shown above that the declining AOD over the SAO region is the most remarkable change of aerosol optical properties around the globe in the last 20 years, and the resulted radiative forcing can significantly contribute to the progressive change of SST over the SAO. It will be interesting to understand how these changes may relate to the NAO phase conversion. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the spatial structure and temporal variation of the NAO, we present a conceptual model Figure 3 illustrating the thermodynamic and dynamic consequence of aerosol radiative influence on subtropical Atlantic SST and the implications to the NAO/AO. The conceptual model is supported by zonally averaged geopotential height, temperature and wind anomaly profiles Figure 4 derived from the NCEP-2 reanalysis data for the positive phase A and negative phase B of the NAO the details are described in the auxiliary material .A conceptual model of the aerosol radiative impact on subtropical Atlantic SST and its influences on the NAO/AO the positive and negative NAO index phases at the left side are from http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/NAO by Martin Visbeck .

Our diagnostic analysis of the NCEP-2 reanalysis data, showing clearly the NAO phase structure for the first time Figure 4 , provides solid evidence of such a role. Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate the physical processes on how SST over the SAO influences the NAO phase conversion through tropical convection and Hadley circulation. When AOD and COD are enhanced over the subtropics of Atlantic Ocean, the downward solar radiation is reduced by the absorbing and scattering processes of aerosols and clouds. According to the new conceptual model Figures 3 and 4 , the declined SST over the SAO associated with the reduced solar radiation triggers a stronger tropical Hadley cell than normal years. Then in the upper layer 500~100 hPa , more air mass transports northward to downwind regions, which results in a decreased subtropical upper layer High. The relative wind convergence at middle-low latitude and divergence at middle-high latitude could enhance the Azores High and deepen the Icelandic Low. The increased pressure gradient between the two pressure systems strengthens the Ferrel cell, and then causes the westerlies stronger than normal years. The enhanced western wind usually could also deepen the Polar vortex and reduce the pressure over high latitude regions. It is clear from Figure 4 that the south-warm and north-cool temperature anomaly structure over middle latitude regions is formed by the impact from the changed atmospheric stability. In the stratosphere, because of the strengthened western wind, more warm polar air can transport southward to the tropic and subpolar regions to enhance the temperature over there, while the stratospheric temperature in subtropics and polar is reduced by the enhanced wind speed due to their close association. When AOD and COD decline over the SAO, the opposite occurs. The above physical interpretations agree well with the NAO phase structure rebuilt from the NCEP-2 reanalysis data., and even the greenhouse gas. Nevertheless, the key physical processes responsible for the annual/decadal fluctuation of the NAO are still unclear. Based on our comprehensive analyses of a variety of relevant data and a new conceptual model illustrating for the first time the atmospheric thermodynamic and dynamic anomaly structures during positive and negative NAO phase, we show that the two decades variation of African aerosol may partially explain the fluctuation of SST over the Subtropical Atlantic Ocean and the associated influences on the North Atlantic climate change. Since African aerosol, which is dominated by the dust defilation and transport processes, is highly anti-correlated with rainfall in the Sudan-Sahel which in turn is quite sensitive to SST variability in all tropical basins including the remote Pacific and local Atlantic and Indian , the aerosol variation over the SAO and its implicated climate impact on the NAO/AO may present a bridge to link the teleconnection of the NAO and SST anomaly over tropical Pacific/Indian Ocean regions."
126,particles aerosol,"Remote sensing of aerosol water uptake. Aerosol water content is an important component of aerosol radiative forcing, but the effect of water uptake on aerosols throughout the atmospheric column is not monitored at the present time. We present a technique for retrieving the volume fraction of water in atmospheric aerosols, and apply the technique to the AERONET database. We estimate that the volume fraction of water and the geometric hygroscopic growth factor gHGF can be retrieved to within 0.3 using this retrieval. The growth factors we obtain are consistent with published measurements, and indicate that aerosol water uptake is high in humid continental regions gHGF similar to 1.3 along the U. S. East Coast in August and low in regions dominated by desert dust gHGF similar to 1.04 in Saudi Arabia . Citation: Schuster, G. L., B. Lin, and O. Dubovik 2009 , Remote sensing of aerosol water uptake, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L03814, doi: 10.1029/2008GL036576. . This aerosol water uptake has a significant impact on visibility and is a key component of the aerosol direct effect in regions with elevated relative humidities. Aerosol water content is strongly dependent upon aerosol composition and relative humidity , and is the average real refractive index at the available wavelengths. This constraint was adjusted to match the hygroscopic growth at the ARM SGP site, and produces a maximum insoluble fraction of 80% for all retrievals at the 53 AERONET that we tested; this is consistent with the maximum insoluble fraction deduced by ., and a black carbon component refractive index  We examine the relationship between LWP a and aerosol composition in Table 1 , which shows the coefficient of determination R 2 for the fine and coarse volume concentrations at several AERONET sites. All of the sites in Table 1 indicate much higher R 2 values for the fine mode than for the coarse mode with the exception of Ouagadougou , consistent with our expectations of the previous paragraph. More broadly, R fine 2 is almost always greater than R crs 2 at all of the AERONET sites that we tested minimum of 100 retrievals each ; only 15 of the 351 sites 4% have R crs 2 > R fine 2 , and these sites are almost exclusively the dust sites of Northern Africa and some coastal sites.The ratio of average fine volume fraction to total volume fraction is also shown. AERONET all-points, level 1.5 dataset.  It is useful to place these results in the context of previous studies, even though water uptake is almost exclusively reported at a reference RH 80–90% rather than the ambient conditions of our retrievals. Previous aerosol hygroscopic growth measurements have indicated that aerosol hygroscopicity can be classified into several categories: particles are “nearly-hydrophobic” when gHGF = 1.0–1.11, “less-hygroscopic” when gHGF = 1.11–1.33, “more-hygroscopic” when gHGF > 1.33, and as “sea-salt” in marine airmasses when gHGF > 1.85 all at a reference RH of 90% . Hence, desert dust aerosols are dominated by nearly-hydrophobic particles, biomass burning aerosols are characterized by less-hygroscopic particles, and polluted continental sites tend to be dominated by more-hygroscopic particles. We applied our retrieval of gHGF to all available AERONET refractive index retrievals and computed column-effective monthly averages requiring at least 10 retrievals for each month ; global results for the months of February and August are shown in Figure 3 , and the locations of some of the sites that we discuss are presented in Table 1 .February and August climatology of the geometric hygroscopic growth factor gHGF at all AERONET sites. AERONET all-points, level 2.0 dataset, minimum of 10 retrievals.  Finally, we also computed column-effective growth factors obtained at nine AERONET sites deployed for the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil SCAR-B field mission Alta Floresta, Brasilia, Campo Grande, Cuiaba, El Refugio, Ji Parana, Santarem, Tukurui, and Uberlandia ; we obtained a median value of gHGF = 1.04, which is midrange of the values that Kotchenruther and Hobbs , aerosols in the coarse mode are generally composed of different species than the accumulation mode, so they have different water uptake. The water uptake of this retrieval represents a value that is intermediate of either mode; if a dominant mode exists, then the retrieved water is more representative of the dominant mode than the secondary mode.. We note that although equation 1 is appropriate for the ARM SGP site and perhaps other continental sites as well, it may not be appropriate for all locations. Nonetheless, it seems reasonable that a range of large refractive indices ≳1.53 correspond to aerosol mixtures with little or no water. Further testing at a multitude of AERONET sites is necessary. We presented a method for retrieving the aerosol water uptake from the aerosol real refractive index, and applied it to the column-effective AERONET retrievals. We estimate the aerosol water fraction and geometric hygroscopic growth factor are accurate to better than 0.3, but this retrieval has not been fully validated at the present time. Nonetheless, this technique is consistent with measurements obtained in Tennessee during SEAVS and Brazil during SCAR-B. The results are also consistent with expectations on a regional and compositional basis, indicating the largest growth factors for polluted regions with high humidities and the smallest growth factors for regions dominated by desert dust."
127,aerosol,"Regional dust model performance during SAMUM 2006. Traditionally there has been a lack of intensive measurements directly over dust sources for validating the accuracy of dust models. Utilizing the valuable and unprecedented SAMUM 2006 field campaign dust dataset in North Africa, we assess the performance and discuss the limitations of a state-of-the-art dust regional model to reproduce the complex dust patterns encountered during the campaign. The DREAM model operational forecast version during SAMUM 2006 OPER and an updated model version RESH are run and compared. RESH reproduces the general Saharan dust pattern, whereas OPER shows limitations to quantitatively reproduce dust optical properties over sources and after long range transport simultaneously. Dust transport in RESH with enhanced number size bin distribution is proven to be more efficient and adequate. The modeled vertical extinction coefficient captures fairly well lidar observations. While particle number size distribution is consistently reproduced at surface level, we find significant underestimation in the middle troposphere for large particles. Occasionally, synoptic scale meteorology remains unsatisfactorily captured leading to errors in the location and intensity of dust emission and subsequent transport. Citation: Haustein, K., C.

During the campaign, the Dust Regional Atmospheric Modeling System DREAM was used as a forecast tool for planning the schedule of the overflights. DREAM is a well established forecast model delivering daily products for North Africa, Europe, Middle East and Asia http://www.bsc.es/projects/earthscience/DREAM/ . Main objective of this contribution is to verify the performance and to discuss the limitations of the operational and an updated research model version in order to capture the complex dust emission pattern encountered during the campaign. includes a high resolution size distribution within the 0.1–10  One would expect good agreement regarding the size distribution at higher altitudes as well, but things turned out to be different as shown in Figures 3a – 3d , providing the particle size distribution over OUZ at May 19th 11 UTC and 20th 13 UTC . Large particles in the middle troposphere are strongly underestimated from OPER and RESH when comparing with number size concentrations measured during the Falcon overflight at 3.2 and 5 km altitude at the same time. However, the modeled tropospheric number size distribution is in the same order of magnitude as the modeled surface number size distribution, in accordance with the vertical cross section of the extinction coefficient see Figure 2e . In turn, having performed a closure study, [2009] showed that in-situ measurements agree with the extinction profile at respective height levels. It could also be proven that the refractive index does not affect the derived particle number size distribution. Advected dust mixed above could explain the differences between measured surface and tropospheric number size distributions to a certain extent. Otherwise, the optical properties of dust for RESH are calculated with an average complex refractive index from GADS, which may alter depending on location, thus altering the extinction efficiency as well. Inaccuracies or simplifications of the dust emission scheme together with an incomplete data set of land cover and soil texture are further sources of uncertainty at all height levels. Conclusively, accordance of modeled and observed size spectra in upper regions of the atmosphere is not sufficiently obtained leaving space for further evaluation in order to achieve consistency.[15]  We have compared two DREAM model versions with experimentally derived results from the SAMUM-I campaign. Particular focus was put on May 19th and 20th 2006 when most measurements were available. Lidar observations and size distribution at surface levels are fairly well reproduced in RESH except for very large particles, due to the limited range of the model size distribution and the poor vertical resolution in the model. In the upper troposphere large particles are more strongly underestimated. Dust at higher altitudes advected from non-local sources may explain these results.[16]  In general, fairly good agreement between model results, AERONET data, and satellite observations with respect to their horizontal and vertical distribution is obtained. It could be shown that RESH outperforms OPER from a quantitative point of view. Underestimation of dust transport in OPER is due to the poor size bin resolution, lacking efficient transport which is mainly driven by smaller particles. The spatio-temporal evolution of the dust plumes was not always sufficiently reproduced for both model versions. The disagreement is related to synoptic-scale meteorology which can not be accurately captured."
128,dust,"Climate effect of dust aerosol in southern Chinese Loess Plateau over the last 140,000 years. The Earth's climate is influenced by the manner in which solar radiation is absorbed and reflected in the atmosphere. In the study, the approach evaluating the radiative forcing of aerosol was used to analyze the climatic effect of dust over the last 140,000 years in the southern Chinese loess plateau. 1 Radiative effect of dust aerosol was to reduce the solar radiation arriving at the surface and thus to lead earth cooling. However, the grain size-driven climatic feedback of dust aerosol was negative on short-term scale, i.e., to weaken the amplitude of climate fluctuation. 2 Glacial-interglacial fluctuation was marked in most optical properties of dust over the last 140,000 years. High-frequent millennial scale fluctuations corresponding to Younger Dryas, Heinrich events and D-O cycles dominated most optical properties of dust aerosol. 3 The climatic feedback of dust aerosol may be a contributor for the climatic transition between glacial and interglacial periods.

Lett., 36, L02707, doi:10.1029/2008GL036156. . In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in interest in the influence of aerosols on climate through direct effect. On a global scale the abundance of natural aerosols is several times greater than that of the major anthropogenic aerosols sulphate, soot and organics . Soil dust constitutes an important portion of the global natural aerosol abundance. As a strongly-scattering aerosol, dust aerosol absorbs sunlight to a greater extent than industrial sulphate and sea salt aerosols. Recent studies have revealed that mineral dust exert significant radiative forcing.. Scattering increases the fraction of sunlight reflected to space and consequently leads the decrease of energy gotten by the earth-atmospheric system and thereby the cooling of whole earth system. Absorption reduces both the reflection at the top of atmosphere TOA and the surface illumination.. Further, dust aerosol could also lead the difference between the surface and the lower atmosphere. , the altitude at which the dust layer is located and the relative altitude from the cloud layer. Dust aerosols have significant contribution to radiative warming below 500mb due to short-wave absorption but less effect on long-wave radiation. Dust approximately doubles the short-wave radiation absorption under clear-sky conditions.. Chinese Loess Plateau is the largest loess area in the world. Nevertheless, it was unknown whether or not dust aerosols of Eastern Asia could influence paleo-global climate and how the radiative effect of dust aerosols fluctuated in glacial-interglacial cycles. In the study, the climate effect of dust aerosol in southern Chinese loess plateau over the last 140000 years was analyzed from the loess-paleosol sequence at Weinan, Shanxi province. The sequence was divided 4 sections, S 0 , L 1 , S 1 and L 2 , based on field observation and magnetic susceptibility MS . The loess formation L 1 was divided into five sub-layers again, i.e., 3 loess layers L 1−1 , L 1−3 and L 1−5 and paleosol-like layers L 1−2 poorly developed and L 1−4 . Measurements of MS and grain size of samples followed methods of , important age-controlling points were chosen. Particularly, the age-control points in S 1 were chosen by referring to the top and bottom ages of S 1 and stalagmite ages. The age of samples between two adjacent control points is interpolated by following 's. Aerosol particle size plays a major role in the radiative effect of dust aerosols. Mie scattering theory of dust aerosol describes the radiative effect of particles with diameter 0.03∼100 and 0.35∼0.7 of , respectively. . b stacked marine δ 18 O records numbers indicate the order of marine oxygen isotopic stages MIS . c MS, d Md, e EC, f AOD, g reflectance, h Δ R s and i F a,s / F a,a of dust aerosol. j GISP2 ice core δ 18 O and k Be 10 . l TOC of India ocean 111KL core. m A combined δ 18 O sequence of stalagmites from Hulu, Dongge and Sanbo caves in southeast of China different color lines and symbols indicate different stalagmite samples.

H1-H6, Heinrich cooling events. 19 grey bars are long-term about 5∼6 ka low-EC events, corresponding to strong turbulence events in dust depositional area and Heinrich cooling events. Dark grey lines indicate short-term 1.3ka± rapid fluctuations of dust size-driven EC, similar to D-O cycles. Most decreases of SC, EC, SSA and AOD in cooling events after L 1−2 were rapid, sudden and not sinusoidal, suggesting that they were periodic abrupt cooling events in Chinese loess plateau area and implied a strong instability of the period's climate.. However, MS would rapidly reduce if pedogenesis and chemical weathering are strong enough to overstep the linear-correlation range between MS and pedogenesis. Thus, the first likely reason is that pedogenesis and chemical weathering in the beginning of S 1 were excessive. Another reason may be that the summer monsoon shown by MS reinforcing from L 2 to S 1 lagged behind the winter monsoon represented by SC weakening after L 2 . increased. Usually, strong winter monsoon would result in more coarse dust particles to deposit, thus to reduce fine particles' proportion, suggesting that a low SC may indicate a strong winter monsoon. Therefore, a reasonable explanation is that the strong winter monsoon would lead atmospheric turbulent intensity strengthening and more coarse particles settling, in turn to cause weak dust-scattering and more B 10 adhered on dust particles. Low temperature in cold events resulted in a low bio-productivity in ocean, in turn to lead less TOC deposition in marine.. Thus, stalagmite δ 18 O of the south of China is used as a proxy of summer monsoon's intensity. The similarity of millennial scale fluctuations between stalagmite δ 18 O and dust SC implies several likely mechanisms. The first likely explanation is that the Eastern Asian summer and winter monsoons fluctuated reversely on millennial scales.. Fine dust particles' settlement was controlled by the atmospheric turbulent intensity in dust deposition areas far away from sources in the north. It implies that the summer monsoons derived from the south may dominate stalagmite δ 18 O and SC.. The precipitation proportion between winter-spring and summer may dominate stalagmite δ 18 O. The heavier stalagmite δ 18 O, the larger the precipitation amount of winter-spring when is the dust storm season in the northern China. In the case, both stalagmite δ 18 O and dust SC indicated fluctuations of winter monsoon.[30]  Further, stalagmite δ 18 O may be indirectly affected by dust aerosol's climatic feedback. In cooling events, the grain size-driven low SC would lead high surface illumination and large solar radiative absorption of surface during winter/spring, in turn more water to be evaporated and more heavy δ 18 O rain to subsequently precipitate during spring and early summer, eventually to result in heavier stalagmite δ 18 O during cooling events. These mechanisms are unapproved and disputable but they are valuable and helpful for the study in future."
129,dust aerosol,"Effects of sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate coatings on the ice nucleation properties of kaolinite particles. The onset conditions for ice nucleation on H2SO4 coated, NH4 2 SO4 coated, and uncoated kaolinite particles at temperatures ranging from 233 to 246 K were studied. We define the onset conditions as the relative humidity and temperature at which the first ice nucleation event was observed. Uncoated particles were excellent ice nuclei; the onset relative humidity with respect to ice RHi was below 110% at all temperatures studied, consistent with previous measurements. H2SO4 coatings, however, drastically altered the ice nucleating ability of kaolinite particles, increasing the RHi required for ice nucleation by approximately 30%, similar to the recent measurements by Mohler et al. [2008b]. NH4 2 SO4 coated particles were poor ice nuclei at 245 K, but effective ice nuclei at 236 K. The differences between H2SO4 and NH4 2 SO4 coatings may be explained by the deliquescence and efflorescence properties of NH4 2 SO4. These results support the idea that emissions of SO2 and NH3 may influence the ice nucleating properties of mineral dust particles. Citation: Eastwood, M. L., S. Cremel, M. Wheeler, B. J. Murray, E. Girard, and A. K. Bertram 2009 , Effects of sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate coatings on the ice nucleation properties of kaolinite particles, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L02811, doi: 10.1029/2008GL035997. . During their lifetime in the atmosphere, mineral dust particles can become coated with inorganic and organic material. There have only been a few studies that have directly compared the ice nucleation properties of both coated and uncoated mineral dust particles at temperatures relevant for the troposphere in order to isolate the effect of coatings. A few other studies have measured the freezing properties of aqueous inorganic or organic solution droplets containing mineral dust particles.. This research should be useful when trying to determine if anthropogenic emissions of SO 2 and NH 3 affect climate by influencing natural ice nuclei such as mineral dust.. It consists of an optical microscope coupled to a flow cell in which the relative humidity could be accurately controlled. Mineral dust particles either coated or uncoated were deposited on the bottom surface of the flow cell; the relative humidity with respect to ice RH i inside the cell was increased, and the conditions under which ice crystals first formed were determined with a reflected light microscope this is defined as the onset RH i and temperature . The RH i over the particles was controlled by continuously flowing a mixture of dry and humidified He through the flow cell. The bottom surface of the flow cell, which supported the particles, consisted of a glass cover slide treated with dichlorodimethylsilane to make a hydrophobic layer, which reduced the probability of ice nucleation directly on the surface. We also carried out growth rate calculations of aqueous solution droplets using the equations presented by . In contrast to the uncoated results, the H 2 SO 4 coated particles required much higher supersaturations before ice nucleation occurred. The data show that H 2 SO 4 coatings drastically altered the ice nucleating ability of kaolinite particles, increasing the RH i required to initiate ice nucleation by approximately 30%.. Figure 1 illustrates that for almost all of the experimental conditions, the H 2 SO 4 coatings are concentrated aqueous solutions >10 wt % H 2 SO 4 and highly acidic the pH of a 10 wt % H 2 SO 4 solution is less than 0 . This may help explain our freezing results see below .. The Point of Zero Charge defined as the pH at which the net surface charge is zero for the gibbsite-like surface is approximately 6, while the Point of Zero Charge for the edge surfaces is approximately 7–8. As mentioned above, the pH of the H 2 SO 4 coating was below 0 under most experimental conditions. As a result, the kaolinite particles should exhibit highly protonated, positively charged surfaces with a proton surface density ∼1.2 × 10 14 cm −2 . Under these conditions sulfate anions can be strongly adsorbed to metal oxide surfaces due to electrostatic attractions or the sulfate anions can adsorb by ligand substitution. Strongly adsorbed sulfate anions will change the chemical and physical properties of solid mineral interface. Hence it is not surprising that we observed higher onset RH i values for ice nucleation in our experiments with H 2 SO 4 coatings. studied metal oxides particles, with and without H 2 SO 4 coatings. At 213 K, they observed an increase in RH i after coating for 200 nm aluminum oxide and amorphous aluminum silicate particles, but a decrease in RH i for 200 nm iron oxide particles. In contrast, at 228 K the change in the RH i due to the coatings on 200 nm particles was less than the uncertainty in the measurements. Differences between our measurements and the measurements by studied illite particles coated with sulfuric acid H 2 SO 4 mass fraction about 30% at 210 K. They observed a significant reduction in the ice nucleation efficiency of the particles after coating. Specifically, an increase in RH i necessary for ice nucleation of approximately 35–40% was observed. Our results are similar to these previous results... The RH i is then increased and, above 100% RH i , ice can nucleate on the crystalline NH 4 2 SO 4 coating. In this case, ice nucleation occurs by deposition freezing. If ice nucleation does not occur, the solid NH 4 2 SO 4 coating can take up water at the deliquescence relative humidity. Above this relative humidity, the NH 4 2 SO 4 coating is a liquid and ice nucleation can occur by immersion freezing.Schematic of the possible phase behavior of an NH 4 2 SO 4 coating during a typical freezing experiment.. This is illustrated in the auxiliary material where we compare our NH 4 2 SO 4 data with these previous measurements. Our initial results support the idea that anthropogenic emissions of SO 2 and NH 3 may influence the ice nucleating properties of mineral dust particles by increasing the relative humidity required for ice nucleation. This shift in ice nucleation conditions may influence the frequency and properties of ice clouds. Calculations using a cloud parcel model are needed to explore this possibility further. One area where these results may be especially important is the Arctic region where a large fraction of the aerosol particles including insoluble aerosols such as mineral dust can be coated with acidic sulfate.[22]  We have reported initial results for coated and uncoated kaolinite particles. Additional experiments as a function of particle size, surface area, and coating thickness are also needed. Measurements of the fractions of ice-active mineral particles as a function of temperature and humidity would also be beneficial."
130,dust impact aerosol,"Saharan dust particles nucleate droplets in eastern Atlantic clouds. Many soil-derived particles dominated by insoluble material, including Saharan dusts, are known to act as ice nuclei. If, however, dust particles can compete with other atmospheric particle types to form liquid cloud droplets, they have a greater potential to change climate through indirect effects on cloud radiative properties and to affect the hydrological cycle through precipitation changes. By directly collecting and analyzing the residual nuclei of small cloud droplets, we demonstrate that Saharan dust particles do commonly act as cloud condensation nuclei CCN in the eastern North Atlantic. Droplet activation calculations support the measurements by showing that due to its slightly hygroscopic nature, even submicron dust can be important as CCN. Given the dual nature of Saharan dust particles as CCN and ice nuclei, this infusion of dust is expected to impact not only droplet size and albedo in small clouds, but ice formation in deep convective clouds. . Additionally, dust particles with sources from the Saharan region have been identified as efficient ice nuclei in laboratory and field studies. Dunion and Velden ., aerosol physiochemical characteristics and cloud size distributions were measured over the tropical eastern Atlantic Ocean from a DC-8 aircraft in late summer of 2006. Measurements of microphysical properties of the small cumulus clouds in this region revealed that in most cases, droplet number concentrations were higher than expected for clean marine clouds. Cumulus clouds in the Caribbean Ocean tend to have droplet concentrations of 50 to 150 cm −3 , while in the eastern Atlantic, mean droplet concentrations ranged from about 50 to 500 cm −3 , with seven of the eleven cases having mean concentrations higher than 150 cm −3 . This suggests that a substantial fraction of dust and other non-marine particles are acting as CCN in the eastern Atlantic.. Figure 1 shows vertical profiles of aerosol scattering ratio 1a and 1b and water vapor mixing ratio 1c from a differential absorption lidar, looking down through the dust layer which extended to about 5.5 to 6 km above sea level. The water vapor image shows that the absolute humidity in the SAL was higher over the ocean, where the leading edge of the SAL was likely mixing with the background moister environment. Small clouds formed at about 5 km and are indicated by the darkest backscatter regions toward the left of Figure 1a and in Figure 1b , where the lidar was fully attenuated below.Onboard lidar images for 5 September 2006 from a west to east track, looking down through the Saharan Air Layer SAL . a Aerosol scattering ratio ASR image.

In normal mode, the CVI rejects interstitial aerosol using a nitrogen counterflow while collecting and evaporating droplets or ice crystals. Individual non-volatile residual nuclei are retained. Ambient aerosol particles can also be collected by turning off the counterflow. Ambient aerosol or cloud residual particles were then collected by a two-stage jet impactor. The small particle stage captured particles approximately 0.1 to 0.5 μm in diameter, while the large particle stage captured particles from about 0.5 μm up to several microns in size. Samples were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry to detect chemical elements. Individual particles were identified as crustal dust, salts, metals, sulfate, carbonaceous, or mixtures of these types as was done by Twohy and Poellot , these younger, smectitic clays are expected to be more hygroscopic. Recently, the critical supersaturations required to activate submicron dust from the northern Sahara have been measured to be similar to those for slightly hygroscopic particles. Additionally, while silicon, aluminum, and iron in Saharan dust are associated with minerals with low solubilities, potassium, magnesium and calcium compounds tend to have higher solubilities. Significant amounts of water-soluble calcium and potassium have been attributed to Saharan dust. The next sample Figure 2b is representative of Saharan dust that had traveled about 700 km offshore, but remained at mid altitudes with little interaction with the marine boundary layer. This sample from 3.7 km was almost entirely composed of dust aerosol without detectable S or Cl. This sample actually had a longer overall residence time over the Sahara than the previous sample. Total particle concentrations diameter >0.01 μ m were about 450 cm −3 , with about 72% of them being non-volatile at 300°C, consistent with refractory soil dust. While most of the aerosol volume was present in particles larger than 1 μ m, aerosol number was dominated by particles smaller than 1 μ m in diameter. For the typical supersaturations expected in small cumuli less than ∼0.3% , an insoluble but wettable particle must be larger than ∼0.7 μ m to act as a CCN. Smaller particles must have had nonzero hygroscopicity in order to nucleate cloud drops. Since most of the particles did not have detectable S or Cl, this suggests that dust particles do not have to be “aged”, or coated with soluble material derived from pollution sources, to act as CCN. While thin coatings of volatile nitrate and organics could be missed by our detection technique, we show below that they are not necessary to explain the droplet nucleating ability of Saharan dust., suggesting that substantial dust is entrained into the marine boundary layer. was used to simulate activation of dust to cloud droplets in the eastern North Atlantic under various conditions. The original model was modified to parameterize water activity and hygroscopic growth with a single parameter Kappa, κ. Kappa parameterizes the relationship between dry diameter and critical supersaturation for activation, and is 0.00 for a completely insoluble but wettable particle. Although activation of dusts may proceed by complex mechanisms and the actual wetted size of the particle at activation is not yet established, CCN measurements for a subset of submicron Saharan dust particles indicate κ∼0.05 represents the data well and this simple parameterization can be used to estimate the number of dust particles activated as a function of environmental supersaturation..Case letters correspond to same letters as panes in Figure 3 .Kappa for a mixture can be computed by volume-weighting the individual constituents, and κ = 0.05 corresponds to a volume fraction of ∼8% ammonium sulfate in an otherwise insoluble particle. The effect of dust size is also important. For cases D and E Figures 3d and 3e , both the hygroscopic and dust modes were modeled with a d g of 0.10, consistent with NAMMA volatility and single-particle measurements that indicated at least some of the dust was present in the small size range. The small-mode dust is activated with much lower efficiencies than the larger dust shown in Cases A and B. However, the simulation shows that even small dust with a κ = 0.05 can activate in substantial fractions of 0.2 to 0.7 at updraft velocities between 0.5 and 3 m s −1 Figure 3e . The assumption of slightly hygroscopic dust can explain why substantial numbers of dust particles were observed in droplet residual nuclei for the 5 September case, where the particles were dominated by Saharan dust, and why some dust can activate in the marine boundary layer while competing with hygroscopic species like sea salt and sulfate.. Since ice crystal number concentrations in most clouds are typically about three orders of magnitude smaller than droplet concentrations, substantial changes in ice number concentration and size are possible as a result of dust entering droplets as CCN.. Additionally, changes in latent heating profiles in deep convection due to dust acting as IN are likely to change not only cloud microstructure and macrostructure but also cloud dynamics, with additional impacts on precipitation efficiency and storm lifetime. Dust influence on precipitation patterns over the Atlantic could impact ocean primary productivity and CO 2 flux, since aquatic biota are fertilized by iron and other trace nutrients from Saharan dust. Interestingly, modeling studies have shown that increased CCN and ice nuclei can increase or decrease precipitation and convective intensity, depending on environmental conditions and the stage in the storm's lifecycle. Future, more sophisticated modeling should examine this effect for the eastern Atlantic convective environment."
132,dust,"Dust aerosol impact on regional precipitation over western Africa, mechanisms and sensitivity to absorption properties. We investigate the climatic impact of shortwave and longwave radiative forcing of Saharan dust on the West African monsoon and Sahel precipitation using a regional climate model RCM interactively coupled to a dust model and running for the period 1996-2006. Two competing effects are found. First a reduction of monsoon intensity in the lower troposphere induced by the dust surface cooling causes a reduction of precipitation, and second an 'elevated heat pump effect' in the higher troposphere induced by the dust diabatic warming causes an increase of precipitation. In the standard model configuration, the net impact of these effects is a reduction of precipitation over most of the Sahelian region by about 8% on average except over a Northern Sahel - Southern Sahara band, where precipitation increases. These patterns are very sensitive to the dust absorbing properties, which modulate the intensity of the patterns and the boundary between enhanced and decreased precipitation areas. Finally we show that taking into account dust in the RCM could reduce the model bias compared to available observations. Citation: Solmon, F., M. Mallet, N. Elguindi, F. Giorgi, A. Zakey, and A. Konare 2008 , Dust aerosol impact on regional precipitation over western Africa, mechanisms and sensitivity to absorption properties, Geophys. Res. Lett., 35, L24705, doi: 10.1029/2008GL035900. . One remarkable fact emerging from these studies is that no clear definitive consensus has been reached on whether the atmospheric feedbacks associated with the presence of dust are more likely to increase or decrease precipitation over the Sahelian region. One of the main reasons for such contrasting arguments lies in the difficulty to accurately represent the regional radiative forcing associated to dust aerosol. This forcing occurs at the surface and within the atmosphere and can trigger some differential warming/cooling effects and thus contrasting climatic responses. Dust radiative forcing occurs in the short wave SW or solar and long wave LW or thermal spectral regions and depends on the surface albedo, the presence of clouds and the dust spatial distribution and optical properties.. Published dust particle single scattering albedo SSA values used to characterize the diffusive or absorbing nature of dust, are highly variable. Recent in situ measurements report high values of Saharan dust accumulation mode SSA, ranging from 0.95 to 0.99 at ∼500 nm . From satellite measurements, . The dust source mineralogy iron oxide content , dust coating by absorbing aerosol e.g., biomass burning , size distribution of particles and measurement techniques are all factors that contribute to the variability of observations. For example, . Fewer have however focused on the characterization of possible climate responses to this variability, especially concerning regional scale precipitation. which has notably been applied over West Africa by . Standard dust SW optical properties are listed in Table 1 . The dust LW emissivity and absorptivity are calculated using prognostic dust bin concentrations, LW refractive indices and absorption cross sections consistent with  Regional simulations for the period 1996–2006 are performed over an African domain Figure 1 at 60 km horizontal resolution using the NCEP reanalysis as boundary conditions. Only seasonal June, July, August JJA averages are discussed here. Simulated dust aerosol optical depths AOD Figure 1b have been previously validated using satellite and ground based photometer data and won't be further discussed here. a Top of atmosphere clear sky dust radiative forcing in the standard DUST case. b Dust average aerosol optical depth contour and surface forcing defined by surface absorbed radiation SW + LW difference DUST – NODUST. c TOA radiative forcing for standard case SSA − 5%. d TOA radiative forcing for standard case SSA + 5%.  Figure 1a displays the clear sky top of the atmosphere dust radiative forcing SW + LW TOARF for the standard simulation. The TOARF measures the radiative cooling or warming effect of dust on the surface-atmosphere system before any climatic adjustment takes place. Over the desert region, the TOARF is positive or close to zero as a result of high surface albedo values, which reduce the SW radiative forcing. Moreover, large dust loads Figure 1b and high temperatures in the Saharan dust source regions contribute to a maximum of LW absorption/emission and a positive TOARF. The change of the TOARF sign along 15N Figure 1a is due to a sharp decrease of surface albedo between desert and savannah land cover type and a decrease of average dust load away from the source regions. Overall, the simulated values of TOARF are consistent with the .. The main effect of dust radiative forcing is a reduction of simulated precipitation over the Sahel region from 5N to 15N Figures 2b and 3d . The decrease of precipitation is associated with a meridional differential circulation opposite to the normal monsoon circulation in the lower troposphere 0∼4000 m and intensified subsidence between 15 and 20N Figures 3a and 3d . These features illustrate an average decrease of the ‘monsoon pump intensity’ induced by dust effects. We also note that in the lower troposphere Figure 3a the average cloud liquid water is reduced in the middle troposphere when dust is accounted for. This reduction of cloud thickness is consistent with the decrease of precipitation. These results are in line with the argument that the dust surface cooling and the associated reduction of surface energy flux, moist static energy meridional gradient and convection over the Sahel are the dominant mechanisms leading to a reduction of precipitation. over India. This pattern is likely to result from dust atmospheric diabatic heating see also section 4 , and is associated with an increase of upper troposphere cloud water mixing ratio which is more pronounced north of 16N Figure 3a . As discussed and illustrated in the auxiliary material the African easterly jet intensity tends to be enhanced and shifted southward when dust are accounted for. for the period 1998–2006.Quantities are calculated for 3 bands of latitude and represent a 15W–15E longitude average. Bias is calculated with regards to CRU 1996–2002 and TRMM 1998–2006 data as NODUST—OBS. Normalised biases, calculated as NODUST—OBS / NODUST, are also given in percent. DUST-NODUST precipitation differences are averaged over the corresponding CRU or TRMM observation years. Relative differences are calculated as DUST-NODUST / NODUST. From 10 to 15∼16 N, the comparison with CRU data shows a marked precipitation overestimation in the NODUST experiment, which is also found compared to the TRMM data although less pronounced over the western portions of Africa. For this region, the DUST-NODUST precipitation difference shows a matching inverse spatial pattern, i.e., a precipitation decrease section 3.2 . Dust effects over the Sahelian region induce an ∼8% precipitation decrease, which partially compensates the −20% bias based on the CRU data Table 2 . This implies a ∼40% reduction of the bias by dust effects. This improvement is less obvious when comparing simulations and TRMM data over the WAM domain Table 2 and Figures 2b and 2d . As mentioned above, the regional climatic response to dust aerosol is likely to depend on many factors and particularly on the dust SSA. In order to investigate the model sensitivity to this parameter, we performed an experiment in which dust bin SSAs were modified by plus and minus five percent compared to standard value Table 1 . This variation falls in the range of the observed estimates used in climate modelling section 1 .. Over the Sahel and Ocean, the cooling obtained in the standard case is now more intense due to higher aerosol diffusivity. When dust is considered as a stronger diffuser standard SSA + 5% case , we note a total cancellation of the elevated heat pump differential circulation Figure 3c , which is replaced by subsidence at all tropospheric levels and reduction of cloud water. In the lower troposphere, the anti monsoon differential circulation is still very active and the dust drying effect is larger than in the standard case, while no increase of precipitation is obtained over the Sahel Figure 3f ., our results suggest finer regional precipitation responses based on coexisting differential circulations patterns induced by the dust radiative forcing at different tropospheric levels. Dust surface and lower troposphere cooling is responsible for a decrease of the monsoon pump intensity whereas atmospheric diabatic warming over the source areas could trigger an elevated heat pump effect resulting in enhanced moisture transport and cloud formation in the higher troposphere over the Sahel. The overall regional impact of dust on average precipitation results from these coexisting effects. Using the standard optical properties along with precipitation observations, we show that the model biases in simulating precipitation over the region can be improved by taking into account dust effects. When compared to CRU data, dust could contribute to a ∼40% of the precipitation positive model bias. Although a strict causality is difficult to establish because of other model imperfections responsible for biases, our results are still indicative of the importance of including dust in forecast and climate models. Finally it should be recalled that other factors can potentially modify the simulated climatic signals obtained, as the number of dust bins, the potential effect of dust on cloud microphysics, the use of different land surface, convection and interactively coupled ocean schemes."
133,climate aerosol,"Implications of particle composition and shape to dust radiative effect: A case study from the Great Indian Desert. The assessment of direct radiative forcing DRF of aerosol is uncertain, particularly where the natural dust particles mix with the anthropogenic components. One of the sources of such uncertainty is the assumption of morphology size and shape and composition of pure dust particles. Recently Mishra and Tripathi [2008] have computationally assessed the effect of particle morphology on optical properties over the Great Indian Desert. As a continuation of the previous study, in this paper, we have further examined the effects on dust radiative properties. Non-spherical pure dust particles show large variations in the optical and radiative properties from spherical pure dust particles, however, particle composition is found to have greater influence than particle shape on the radiative properties. Among the various shapes, sharp-edged particles show larger difference than smooth-shaped particles. Although the overall atmospheric absorption monotonically increases with increase in hematite content, maximum effect of particle non-sphericity at 4% hematite content implies that non-sphericity should be considered to minimize the uncertainty of regional estimates of aerosol DRF, as most of the global dusts contain that much hematite. However the difference in radiative properties for two different background dust cases due to particle morphology is low. Our results show that ignoring nonsphericity will lead to under-estimation of the regional warming and dust-absorption efficiency. Citation: Mishra, S. K., S. Dey, and S. N.

Mixing of pure dust particles with the anthropogenic pollution during the long-range transportation have been found to affect the optical and radiative properties in the region. Back trajectory analysis, satellite data and chemical evidence mark the Great Indian Desert Thar Desert as one of the major dust source regions, which increases the efforts to quantify the dust optical properties over there. The Great Indian Desert, an extensive arid region covering ∼0.32 million km 2 of India and Pakistan, receives very little rainfall <300 mm annually and shows very high range of variation in surface temperature ∼50 0 C in summer to ∼−3 0 C in winter . Wind speed reaches 25–30 km hr −1 in the summer raising tremendous amount of dusts in the atmosphere, and results in average soil loss of 30–60 kg m −2 day −1 in April–June.. The dust particle size and shapes depend on many environmental factors, wind friction velocity and shear stress, soil roughness and moisture, atmospheric stability, presence of non-erodible elements, and cohesion of soil grains. have allowed to consider the non-sphericity during the retrieval of dust optical properties from ground-based and satellite remote sensing. over the south Asian regions. This approach considers the satellite-measured TOA radiance at 10.5–12.5. The increase of sharp edged particles with hematite content >2% during the dust storms will give rise to more heating of atmospheric column. The significance of consideration of particle shape is more in the regions with high hematite content >5% , i.e. east and middle-east Asia and the regions where black carbon mixes with pure mineral dust i.e. Indo-Gangetic basin in northern India and East Asia , because enhancement in the atmospheric warming will be under-estimated if particle morphology is not considered. will be minimized if the aerosol model is improved by incorporating the dust particle morphology, because the region suffered frequent dust storms from the Great Indian Desert and middle-east Asia. Particle non-sphericity is also important as . The difference in IRBT for the dust and non-dust case, defined as IDDI, has been calculated for all the cases discussed above. The variation of IDDI due to particle shape and composition is less than 2%, but at the same time, increase in extinction coefficient will lead to an increase in aerosol optical depth. The difference could be larger for coarser particles. As D AE is a ratio of IDDI and AOD, under-estimation of AOD will lead to under-estimation of D AE , given that IDDI does not change much for an aerosol system predominantly composed of mineral dust e.g. contribution of dust is more than 60% to AOD during pre-monsoon season in the northern India . This influence will obviously be less for the time when relative contribution of dust reduces e.g. dust contributes ∼18% to AOD in winter season , but even then it can not be neglected. 1. Particle composition has stronger effect than the shape on the integral radiometric characteristics of pure dust. Absorption increases as indicated by decrease in SSA at higher rate at UV than VIS and is negligible at NIR wavelength with increase in hematite content.. Treatment of non-sphericity in dust-black carbon mixture is another important aspect for future investigations."
134,dust,"Reply to comment by Andrey Ganopolski and Thomas Schneider von Deimling on ""Aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity deduced from the Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene transition''.   hereafter referred to as CL08 , we have presented an estimate of aerosol forcing and climate sensitivity based on Vostok ice core data for the Last Glacial Maximum LGM to Holocene transition. The novel feature of our analysis was the use of a cooling from a warm period about 42,000 years ago or 48,000 depending on the time scale used to the LGM together with the warming from the LGM to Holocene. The use of these two period together provided an additional constrain of the aerosol radiative forcing, and consequently the aerosol radiative forcing from the LGM to Holocene transition was obtained from the data rather than from the modeling as has been done in the past. Our results suggest the aerosol radiative forcing for the LGM to Holocene transition to be 3.3 ± 0.8 W/m 2 and the climate sensitivity to be between 0.36 and 0.68 K/Wm −2 yielding a global temperature increase between 1.3 and 2.3 K for doubling atmospheric CO 2 concentration . For comparison the IPCC report suggests the temperature range for CO 2 doubling to be between 2 and 4.5 K with 60% probability , with values below 1.5 K very unlikely. Thus our result supports the lower end of the IPCC suggested values. hereafter referred to as GS08 has raised several interesting questions, which we answer in the following.  GS08 points out that we have used the Antarctic cooling of 10.2 K for the LGM deduced from the Vostok data without attaching an uncertainty to this value. The temperature difference used by CL08 of 10.2 K between the Holocene and the LGM was deduced from the oxygen isotope ratio δ 18 O from the Vostok ice core. The EPICA Dome C ice project uses the deuterium δ D to recover the temperature. Their result for the difference between the LGM and the Holocene is again around 10 K. Thus there is a good agreement between the two ice cores using two different methods to deduce the temperature differences. Although there may be some uncertainty in the Antarctic temperature LGM to Holocene difference, the 10.2 K for the Vostok site seems to be reasonable.. The ratio of the global to tropical temperature increase during the instrumental records 1880–2007 has been around 1.43 Figure 1a . If we assume a similar ratio of global to tropical warming of 1.4 to 1.5 for the LGM to Holocene warming, we obtain the global temperature difference of 4.6 to 4.9 K. The frequently used approximation of the global temperature change during the LGM to Holocene transition is that the global temperature change has been about of the Antarctic change, which leads to values around 5 K. We have emphasized the uncertainty in the global temperature during the LGM of CL08 by using three different values, namely, 4.1, 4.6 and 5.1 K. Consequently, we consider the chosen range 4.1 to 5.1 K to be adequate. On the other hand we agree with GS08 that using a variety of models might suggest a wider range depending on specific models used. a Temperature anomaly tropics: 24°S to 24°N and global according to the data from the NASA GISS website suggests the ratio of the global mean to tropical temperature change of 1.43. Essentially the same slope ratio is obtained for the time spans 1880–2007 1.43 , 1900–2007 1.42 or 1980–2007 1.38 . Thin lines connect the annual data; thick lines show the linear regressions. b Oxygen isotopic ratio for the GRIP and the Byrd Station ice cores annual values and 5 year running mean showing the Dansgaard-Oeschger event 12 DO-12 and the Antarctic event A-2. The data used are from Blunier and Brook . Maximum concentrations around 25 KYBP as well as minimum around 45 KYBP occur simultaneously in both the Antarctic and the Greenland ice cores.. Other researchers pointed out that the aerosol radiative forcing during the LGM, at least in the tropics, could be as strong as the radiative forcing due to increased greenhouse gases during the LGM to Holocene transition. Our results confirm these higher values and suggest that the radiative forcing due to aerosols was, indeed, approximately equal to the radiative forcing of greenhouse gases during the LGM to Holocene transition.. It was found that the starting point of warming in Antarctica leads that of Greenland by one or two thousands years. While the Antarctic temperature increase is gradual within a few thousand years, the Greenland warming is fast, lasting maybe as little as two or three decades. Thus Greenland warming catches up with the Antarctic warming and the temperature peaks do occur in both hemispheres almost simultaneously with the Greenland delay of a few hundred years Figure 1b being smaller than uncertainty of the time scale ±300 yrs . Although the beginnings of warming periods are not simultaneous in the two hemispheres, the peak temperatures and the following cooling are. In the time interval selected the temperature peak of the Antarctic event A-2 coincides with the temperature peak in the Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger event 12. After that both Antarctic and Greenland temperatures are simultaneously decreasing, suggesting the synchronized climate change. Thus our analysis CL08 of the ice core data for a time of a maximum temperature around 42,000 to 48,000 years BP and the minimum temperature during the LGM is justified. The dust deposits showing low values at the maximum temperatures and the following major simultaneous peaks in the Greenland and Antarctic ice cores Figure 1c further confirm that the changes in dustiness were global in character. suggests dust flux increases into the Pacific Ocean by a factor 2.5 ± 0.5 during the LGM. Our simulation increased the dust burden by a factor of 3.4, increased the aerosol optical depth by about 0.15 compared to about 0.04 estimated for the post industrialization increase , and produced the aerosol radiative forcing of 3 W/m 2 . Thus we conclude that the role of glacial aerosols is likely to be as large or at least almost as large as deduced from observational data of CL08 and our range of climate sensitivity is reasonable but may be a bit underestimated."
135,dust climate ocean,"Dust generation and drought patterns in Africa from helium-4 in a modern Cape Verde coral. We show that helium-4 He-4 concentrations in a modern Porites coral from Cape Verde provides a robust reconstruction of mineral dust loading over the Eastern Tropical Atlantic from mid-1950's to mid-1990's. The He-4 record demonstrates pronounced increases in dust emission from North Africa associated with the severe droughts in the Sahel. Our record provides direct evidence that dust emission rates in the 1950's, prior to the onset of the Sahel droughts, were a factor of nine lower than during 1980-84. This large change in dust emission rate indicates global aerosol contents would have increased by similar to 45% over this period, which may have contributed to a reduction in solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. We find that dust emission from North Africa is most closely related to drought patterns, rather than to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns resulting from climate oscillations, such as North Atlantic Oscillations and El Nino/Southern Oscillation. Citation: Mukhopadhyay, S., and P. Kreycki 2008 , Dust generation and drought patterns in Africa from helium-4 in a modern Cape Verde coral, Geophys. Res. Lett., 35, L20820, doi: 10.1029/2008GL035722. . The dust mobilized in the Sahara and Sahel regions of Africa can affect precipitation in the Sahel, nutrient cycling in the Amazon, Atlantic cyclogenesis, and regional air quality in the Caribbean and southeast USA. Clearly, variability in dust emission in the Sahara-Sahel region can have important environmental consequences. Current climate models suggest anywhere from a 60% decrease to a 10% increase in dust emission rates from the Sahara-Sahel region over the next century. Hence, both the predicted sign and magnitude of dust flux variations remain model dependent. A long-term dust emission record, close to dust sources in Africa, would be valuable for understanding the controls on North African dust emission rates and for benchmarking climate models that seek to predict future dust emission rates.. Prior to the satellite record, the Barbados dust sampling station, operating since 1966, provides the only high-resolution record of dust emission from Northern Africa. The atmospheric dust concentrations during the summer months at Barbados also show a strongly negative correlation with Sahel rainfall. However, African dust reaches Barbados primarily during the summer months, while approximately half of the dust export from Northern Africa occurs during the winter months. Additionally, dust transport and dust depositional processes may have influenced some of the variability seen in the Barbados dust record. Here we use a new technique to reconstruct annual dust emission rates from North Africa during the 2nd half of the 20th century from a site close to the sources of dust. Our technique utilizes a Porites coral as a high-resolution dust archive and helium-4 4 He to trace the total amount of mineral dust trapped in the coral skeleton. 4 He is produced by radioactive decay of U and Th and is, therefore, highly enriched in dust derived from continental crust. 4 He is not adsorbed onto mineral surfaces, scavenged by particles, or incorporated into biogenic phases. As a result, the 4 He concentration will be directly proportional to the amount of mineral dust. The utility of 4 He as an excellent proxy of mineral dust has been demonstrated from studies in deep-sea sediments.. The 4 He flux was determined by multiplying the 4 He concentration per gram of CaCO 3 with the coral calcification rate see auxiliary material for details ., leading to undersampling of rare large particles see auxiliary material . In addition, some of the high frequency fluctuations may arise from sediment resuspension events and processes of sediment incorporation into the corals. A 3-year running mean reduces the scatter and shows a remarkable similarity between the 4 He depositional flux and the surface dust concentration SDC record from Barbados. For the period 1966 to 1994, both records show the same overall trends: ∼2-fold increase in the baseline values, and two prominent peaks, one in the early 1970s and one in the early 1980s corresponding to severe droughts in the Sahel. The correlation between the summer SDC at Barbados and the 4 He-based proxy record is 0.81 r = 0.73 for the unsmoothed time-series , significant at >99% confidence level Table 1 .Crustal 4 He flux compared to the summer surface dust concentration SDC at Barbados. The summer SDC is from Prospero and Lamb . The open symbols are 4 He flux for individual years. To reduce the effects of occasional sampling of rare large mineral dust particles, the 4 He flux was smoothed using a 3-year running mean. To directly compare the SDC record with the 4 He flux, the SDC signal was also smoothed with a 3-year running mean. Both the 4 He and SDC signals show a remarkable co-variation.The NINO 3.4 is defined by Trenberth .No correlation is observed between NINO3.4 and dust and from same year.The confidence level is higher than calculated from the t-test. This is because the power spectrums of the two time series are significantly different.. 4 He, however, is not sensitive to volcanic or carbonaceous aerosols. Hence, the decline in 4 He flux reflects the decrease in dust emission rates from Africa. Overall, the relationship between AOD and 4 He flux lead us to conclude that mineral dust incorporation into the Porites coral is proportional to the column abundance of atmospheric dust.Comparison of 4 He flux with annual AOD over Cape Verde. Both the 4 He and AOD records were smoothed using a 3-year running mean. The AOD values were calculated from the TOMS data http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/aerosols/aot.html . Only pixels with at least 5 days of observations in a month were included in the AOD calculations. and model reconstructions. The relatively close agreement between our reconstruction of absolute rates of mineral dust deposition and estimates based on model reconstructions and sediment trap data suggests that the Porites coral rejects sedimentary particles inefficiently.. Hence, the 9-fold increases in mineral dust emission from North Africa between the mid-1950's to mid-1980's suggests that global atmospheric aerosol loading increased by ∼45% over this period, even if we assume all other aerosol components to have remained relatively constant. By the early 1990's, global atmospheric dust loads would have returned to within 20% of the 1950's level.. Hence, it is plausible that the increased atmospheric dust load from mid 1950's- to the 1980's may have contributed to a reduction in solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface and partially masked the magnitude of global temperature rise resulting from increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.. However, changes in atmospheric circulation patterns associated with the Sahel rainfall anomalies could have influenced some of the variability in summer SDC at Barbados. Indeed, major peaks in the Barbados SDC records are associated with major El Nino events. Likewise, annual variability in dust transport to Barbados is affected by the migration of trade winds and the strength and position of the trade winds are in turn affected by NAO. Hence, although Barbados dust fluxes may be highly correlated with aridity in the Sahel, the correlation may arise in part from dust transport processes influenced by ENSO, NAO, and convective disturbances within the African easterly waves. and Sal does lie beneath the winter dust transport trajectories, as demonstrated by measured dust deposition rates near Cape Verde. Therefore, the weak correlation observed between the Cape Verde dust record and winter NAO is not an artifact of Cape Verde lying outside the realm of winter dust export pathways from North Africa. The reconstructed dust flux from Cape Verde, however, shows a strong negative correlation with rainfall in the Sudano-Sahel region Figure 3 and Table 1 . The 4 He-based proxy record of dust from the Porites coral shows the strongest negative correlations with rainfall patterns in the Sahel Figure 3b , suggesting that the Sahel may be the dominant contributor to atmospheric dust loads over Cape Verde. Additionally, vegetation cover in the Sahel takes up to a year to recover following the return to more wet conditions. Hence, the one-year lag between dust emission rates and precipitation is consistent with soil desiccation and vegetation cover most strongly influencing the variability in dust export to the tropical Atlantic. As a result, while NAO and ENSO do probably affect dust mobilization, such as by influencing the strength and position of the trade winds, Sahel droughts appear to be a more direct link to variability in atmospheric dust loads over Cape Verde and Barbados.Relationship between the 4 He flux and precipitation. a Time-series of the crustal 4 He flux and the inverse of the Sudano-Sahel Precipitation Index SSPI . SSPI is defined as the yearly averages of normalized April–October rainfall departures in the region between 11°N–18°N, expressed as standard deviations from the 1941–2001 mean. The SSPI values are from Prospero and Lamb , regions downwind of the most important dust export trajectories from North Africa, East and Central Asian, and the Arabian Peninsular."
136,impact aerosol,"Dust radiative feedback on Saharan boundary layer dynamics and dust mobilization. Mineral dust radiative effects and feedbacks upon Saharan boundary layer meteorology are estimated by means of regional dust simulations for a one-week period in May 2006. The regional dust model system LM-MUSCAT is used, which allows online interaction of the computed dust load with the solar and thermal radiation and consequently with the model dynamics. For the Bode le depression, a mechanism is proposed that describes positive and negative dust radiative feedbacks on surface wind speeds and dust emission in dependence on atmospheric stratification, dust-induced stabilization, and baroclinity. These effects are attributed to the formation and breakdown of the low-level jet LLJ , which is a common phenomenon in the Bodele. However, such processes are likely also relevant for other Saharan regions. Citation: Heinold, B., I. Tegen, K. Schepanski, and O. Hellmuth 2008 , Dust radiative feedback on Saharan boundary layer dynamics and dust mobilization, Geophys. Res. Lett., 35, L20817, doi:10.1029/2008GL035319. . Dust deposition fertilizes marine and terrestrial ecosystems, which influences the CO 2 -cycle. The atmospheric dust distribution in turn depends on meteorological and climate conditions as well as on soil properties and vegetation cover. attributed reductions in surface wind speeds and dust mobilization to changes in the planetary boundary layer PBL circulation that result from suppressed turbulent mixing of momentum in the presence of dust. . Regional model results in this study show, that the effects on surface wind speeds are related to changes in the PBL circulation and, in particular, are closely connected to the evolution of low level jets LLJs . LLJs are pronounced, vertically limited maxima of wind speed within the PBL. They occur frequently over land worldwide and were demonstrated to be important for dust mobilization in numerous Saharan regions K. Schepanski et al., Meteorological processes forcing Saharan dust emission inferred from MSG-SEVIRI observations of sub-daily dust source activation, submitted to.. The model domain covers an area with lower left corner on a geographical map at, hereafter referred to as surface and TOA forcing. The vertically integrated dust impact on the atmospheric radiation budget is represented by the net atmospheric forcing of mineral dust computed as TOA minus surface forcing. Together with difference plots for temperature and pressure, vertical profiles of potential temperature lapse rate, which is a criterion for thermal atmospheric stability, and wind speed from model runs including radiatively active dust and without dust forcing permit insight into the local impact of mineral dust on forcing PBL.

Even though other driving processes may exist, which are not explicitly analyzed here, a similar mechanism is found in Mali and Mauritania. Some indications pointed towards a seasonal cycle in the dust effects on surface winds with a more distinct negative effect during fall and winter. This might be due to lower surface temperatures and more stable conditions during these seasons. In turn, the dust radiative impact on surface wind speeds feeds back to the dust load Figure 2c . The DOT in high concentration areas is locally reduced by 40–70%, but dust production is strengthened in ambient areas of lower DOT. As the negative effect of dust on surface winds is stronger than the positive effect, the mean DOT is 3–4% lower over the cloud-free northern and southern Sahara and about 5% lower over the Bodélé region for the investigated period. This is consistent with results from  Dust radiative effects and feedbacks on atmospheric dynamics were investigated by Saharan dust simulations for a one-week period in May 2006 using the regional model LM-MUSCAT. In accordance with earlier studies, mineral dust was shown to modify the atmospheric stratification and to induce baroclinity. Both effects change surface winds, which are lowered or increased in dependence on the atmospheric stratification and the degree of stabilization by mineral dust. In contrast to former studies using GCMs, here the processes could be studied in detail on regional scale. For the Bodélé depression the effects were attributed to the formation and breakdown of LLJs, which benefit from dust-induced thermal stabilization and baroclinity. Higher surface wind speeds occur in dust feedback simulations compared to the control run when momentum is mixed downwards to the ground by turbulence. The surface winds decrease when thermal stratification suppresses turbulent mixing more effectively. Such processes are likely also relevant for other Saharan regions. The model results also indicate a seasonal cycle with a more dominant negative feedback on surface winds in fall and winter due to lower surface temperatures and more stable conditions. In dust feedback simulations the DOT was locally reduced by 40–70%, where dust concentration is highest, but increased in surrounding areas of lower DOT. However, mean DOT is 3–4% lower over the cloud-free Sahara and 5% lower over the Bodélé due to the dust radiative impact. Since LLJ breakdown is an important mechanism for dust mobilization, further observations and modeling studies are required to proof the relevance of the identified mechanism."
137,particles dust,"Relative humidity anneal effect on hygroscopicity of aerosol particles studied by rapid-scan FTIR-ATR spectroscopy. Rapid-scan Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection FTIR-ATR spectroscopy was employed to study the effect of the relative humidity anneal on the hygroscopicity of NaCl, NaNO3 and NaClO4 aerosol particles. The annealed NaCl, NaNO3 and NaClO4 particles deliquesced at the relative humidity of similar to 83%, similar to 87% and similar to 48%, respectively, which are much higher than the deliquescence relative humidity of the unannealed particles. The annealing of the particles was suggested to reduce the surface defects, and thereby delayed the deliquescence relative humidity of hygroscopic aerosol particles, which should be a ubiquitous process in the atmosphere. Citation: Lu, P.-D., T. He, and Y.-H. Zhang 2008 , Relative humidity anneal effect on hygroscopicity of aerosol particles studied by rapid-scan FTIR-ATR spectroscopy, Geophys. Res. Lett., 35, L20812, doi: 10.1029/2008GL035302. . Many phenomena have been disclosed about the effect of relative humidity RH on the phases of aerosol particles. Generally, hygroscopic aerosol particles take up gas-phase water to form aqueous solutions at deliquescence relative humidity DRH ., and change the microstructure of glasses. Because deliquescence is a phase transition corresponding to melting for a two-component system of a soluble salt and water, there should be a process similar to the TA as solid aerosol particles are humidified. This process is defined in this work as the relative humidity anneal RHA , i.e., humidifying solid aerosol particles at an RH slightly below their DRH for a relatively long period of time and then slowly dehumidifying them. The DRH was delayed from 75% to 86% after the RHA even for a single crystal of NaCl 001 , owing to the reduction of surface defects. Solid aerosol particles have irregular surfaces with more defects relative to those of the single crystal; therefore, their deliquescence should be heavily affected by the RHA. Compared with FTIR combined with aerosol flow tube FTIR-AFT , the FTIR-ATR technique avoids the disturbance of water vapor signal on spectra due to the limited penetration depth of ATR through the ZnSe crystal. As a result, it can be used to effectively detect the water adsorption on aerosol particles even prior to their deliquescence. Aerosol particles adsorb water with the increase of RH giving rise to an enhancement of the OH stretching band. Therefore, the area of the OH stretching band as a function of RH was used to characterize the deliquescence behavior of aerosol particles in previous work. This method is also used in this work to analyze aerosol particles.. It distinctly increases at ∼72% RH and then continuously grows with the further increase of RH, indicating that the unannealed NaCl particles deliquesce at ∼72% RH. This result agrees with those reported. The NaCl particles annealed at 70% RH have a water uptake below ∼72% RH similar to that of the unannealed particles. However, they do not resemble the unannealed NaCl particles which show the DRH of ∼72%, but rather continuously adsorb a little water till deliquesce at ∼83% RH. The DRH of the annealed NaCl particles is coincident with that of the annealed NaCl single crystal 100 .Deliquescence behavior represented by the area of the OH stretching band of water as a function of RH for the bottom unannealed and top annealed NaCl aerosol particles.. Nevertheless, the NaNO 3 particles annealed at 68% RH slowly absorb water until deliquesce at ∼87% RH.Deliquescence behavior represented by the area of the OH stretching band of water as a function of RH for the bottom unannealed and top annealed NaNO 3 aerosol particles.. However, the NaClO 4 particles annealed at ∼38% RH deliquesce at the higher RH of ∼48%.Deliquescence behavior represented by the area of the OH stretching band of water as a function of RH for the bottom unannealed and top annealed NaClO 4 aerosol particles. showed that the slight water adsorption by the bare ATR crystal ZnSe did not affect the analysis of the water uptake for NaNO 3 aerosol, and the surface information of NaNO 3 aerosol was obtained by the FTIR-ATR method. There are also similar results for NaCl and NaClO 4 aerosols. Therefore, although a change may occur in the contact surface of aerosol particles with the ATR crystal in the annealing process, the water uptake on the aerosol surface also can be detected. In other words, the determination of DRH of aerosols was not affected by the change in the contact of surface in our experiments. Furthermore, because the annealing of aerosols may result in a change in the coverage of aerosols on ATR crystal, we performed contrastive experiments for the high and low coverage of aerosols on ATR crystal. The DRH from the low coverage is consistent with that from the high coverage, indicating that a change in the coverage of aerosols on the ATR has no effects on the determination of DRH of aerosols in our experiments. and experimental studies showed that the calcite most possibly dissolved starting with the defects such as the edges of steps and kinks but not the flat crystal faces. Classical molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the dissolution of NaCl in water would not occur without lattice defects. Moreover, deliquescence was likely on defects for a single crystal of NaCl 001 . Consequently, the RHA retards the DRH of NaCl, NaNO 3 and NaClO 4 aerosol particles, possibly due to the reduction of defects on the surface of the particles induced by ionic rearrangements in the RHA process.[12]  Our results demonstrate the retardant effect of the RHA on the deliquescence of NaCl, NaNO 3 and NaClO 4 aerosol particles. Atmospheric aerosols are enriched with the three components and usually undergo the RHA process in the atmosphere. As a result, the RHA can heavily affect the chemical, physical and optical properties and the surface activity of the atmospheric aerosols which depend on the phase states of the aerosols."
138,aerosol,"Ground-based measurements of airborne Saharan dust in marine environment during the NAMMA field experiment. Several episodes of airborne mineral dust transported from the Saharan deserts were observed at Sal Island, Cape Verde for 2 - 28 September 2006 during the NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses NAMMA field experiment. Dust particles were mixed with marine background aerosols when the dust layers descended into the marine boundary layer. A new method is developed to derive the optical properties of dust when mixed with maritime aerosols. The derived single scattering albedo and mass scattering efficiency differed significantly between two selected cases leading to differences in their direct radiative effects. Back-trajectory analyses suggest that the two cases were influenced by dust particles originating from different source regions over North Africa. This stresses the importance of resolving dust optical properties in sub-regional scales to attain a better assessment of the role of airborne dust on the climate system. Citation: Jeong, M.-J., S.-C. Tsay, Q. Ji, N. C. Hsu, R. A. Hansell, and J. Lee 2008 , Ground-based measurements of airborne Saharan dust in marine environment during the NAMMA field experiment, Geophys. Res. Lett., 35, L20805, doi: 10.1029/2008GL035587. , rendering large radiative effects, while its impact on the climate system still poses significant uncertainty. Characterizing the optical properties of ASD together with its spatial distribution is crucial, as these factors can introduce differential heating/cooling in the atmosphere and surface, thereby causing abrupt changes in the atmospheric circulation. There have been many field experiments to measure the optical properties of Saharan dust. National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA 's African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses NAMMA is the latest effort to remedy the lack of comprehensive observations in the West African region. Most observations of NAMMA are air-borne measurements; however, these can be exceedingly difficult to make from fast moving aircrafts, particularly for large-sized dust particles. Although measurement systems can be more effectively controlled using ground-based instruments to attain optimum conditions for measuring coarse-mode dust, there are still inherent difficulties in dust measurements. One of the obstacles is that the dust layers have to reach the surface, and even when they do, the dust particles get mixed with aerosols in the marine boundary layer MBL . Thus, normally, much more expensive instruments like mass spectrometers or laborious chemical analyses have been needed to acquire the dust optical properties from the surface measurements. After considering the inlets and tubing for individual instruments in COMMIT, the derived sampling efficiencies together with APS-derived aerosol size distributions were used to ensure all the instruments could measure the equivalent aerosol mass. In general, a loss of particles is expected due to imperfect, but inevitable, sampling inefficiency. For example, for particles with diameter less than 10 As illustrated in section 4 , the dust optical properties for the two cases showed large differences. Especially, ω Du for the two cases differed by more than 0.05, exceeding the ranges of uncertainties due to errors in the a priori parameters Figure S2 . Many factors may be at play, such as 1 differences in the dust size distributions due to a size-differential deposition, and 2 differences in the chemical compositions for the two cases. Aerosol size measurements from the APS for Case-II and some other dust episodes during the field experiments showed the same patterns of increases in particle number concentrations for the diameter ranges between 0.8 and 2 μ m, which suggests that size distributions may not be a major factor. Therefore we assume that different chemical composition is a more likely explanation. For example, the iron content of the mineral dust in the form of hematite is an efficient light absorber in the visible. In addition, various types and contents of clays, quartz, fragmented fossil diatoms introduce wide ranges of spectrally differential absorption, which could explain the different ω Du for both cases. Since such contents of mineral components depend on the soil properties of the source regions, it is necessary to find out where the dust for the two cases originated. and Dark Target aerosol products over ocean and vegetated land . In Figure 3 , the areas with high AOT indicate the location and loading of dust during the respective periods. This was cross-checked with the UV Aerosol Index AI from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument aboard the Aura satellite. UV AI has been widely used to detect dust and biomass burning smoke. The areas of high AOT over the Sahara are considered to be possible source regions, especially those crossed by back-trajectories. To make sure, we searched for areas with sudden incidences of enhanced AOT and UV AI on a certain day compared to the previous day around the crosses between the back-trajectories and areas of the enhanced AOT and UV AI. The corresponding areas are marked in the Figure 3 by pink circles. We believe that these areas may have been significant sources contributing to the observed dust for the respective cases. The results indicate that the dust measured at the surface of Sal originate from different source regions between the two cases.MODIS AOT 550 nm averaged for 7 days on and prior to the beginning of each case. Superimposed black lines are 7-day back-trajectories terminating at Sal 16.7N, 22.9W; star symbols . Each line represents a back-trajectory ending at every hour throughout the period of each case. Pink circles stands for the estimated source regions for dust observed at Sal each case. The values of SSA between the two cases, which possibly represent dust originating from different source regions in North Africa, are significantly different. Our assessment see Text S2 suggests that the dust for the two cases could yield 10.1 Wm −2 and −18.7 Wm −2 of differences in daily mean direct radiative effects for a visible band 400–700 nm at the TOA and the surface, respectively Case-I minus Case-II; AOT at 550 nm was assumed to be unity . Atmospheric absorption due to the presence of dust could differ by 28.8 Wm −2 between the two cases under the same conditions. Such differences in absorption could lead to significant uncertainty in assessments of the regional energy budget unless dust optical properties are properly resolved. Dust size distributions are taken into account by some leading aerosol transport models and climate models, but their optical properties are generally fixed over the globe. Given the wide ranges of dust optical properties – even larger than the differences between the two cases of this study - adopted by various climate models, significant discrepancies in the radiative absorption are expected among various models, thereby introducing different heating/cooling rates of the atmosphere and surface. This in turn can cause changes in atmospheric circulation. Therefore, it may be considered necessary for aerosol transport/climate models to resolve dust optical properties depending on source regions or mineralogy in order to reduce uncertainties in the impact of airborne mineral dust on regional and global climate systems."
139,dust climate aerosol,"Contrasting the 2007 and 2005 hurricane seasons: Evidence of possible impacts of Saharan dry air and dust on tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic basin. In this study, we provide preliminary evidence of possible modulation by Saharan dust of hurricane genesis and intensification, by contrasting the 2007 and 2005 hurricane seasons. It is found that dust aerosol loadings over the Atlantic Ocean are much higher in 2007 than in 2005. The temperature difference between 2007 and 2005 shows warming in the low-middle troposphere 900-700 hPa in the dusty region in the eastern North Atlantic, and cooling in the Main Development Region MDR . The humidity wind differences between 2007 and 2005 indicate significant drying subsidence in the Western North Atlantic WNA in 2007. The drier air in the WNA in 2007 is found to be associated with the further westward transport of the Saharan air layer SAL . To quantify wind pattern favorable for transport of SAL over the WNA, we define a zonal wind stretch index which shows significant long-term correlation with the mid-level humidity in the WNA. Analyses of the stretch index and related environmental controls suggest that the westward expansion of the Saharan dry air and dust layer can be an important factor in contributing to the difference between the relatively quiescent hurricane season in 2007 and the very active season of 2005.   Lau and Kim .Radiative forcing is recognized as the most important physical aspect of African dust. African dust outbreaks are associated with an elevated layer of hot and dry air outbreaks. Dry air has impacts on tropical cloud and precipitation directly through thermal structure and indirectly through dry air entrainment. Dry air outbreaks have been shown to affect the formation and intensification of tropical cyclones. However, it still remains uncertain how hurricanes are linked to the dust, dry air, and their associated wind fields., while negative Sahelian rainfall anomalies or Sahel drought were associated with suppressed Atlantic basin Tropical Cyclone TC activity. Goldenberg and Shapiro  Since rainfall in the Sahel is found to be highly anti-correlated with African dust, a hypothesis has been advanced that the Atlantic basin TC activity is anti-correlated with African dust outbreaks. suggested the dry SAL can suppress Atlantic tropical cyclone activity by increasing the vertical wind shear and stabilizing the environment at low levels. Dunion and Velden .. TRMM Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager TMI SST and 10 m wind http://www.ssmi.com ..... In addition to the MDR, TCs are also found to form over the Western Atlantic Region WAR: 20–35°N, 98–50°W , which is to the west of the dusty region, and includes the U.S. East coast or Western North Atlantic WNA: 20–35°N, 80–50°W , and the Gulf of Mexico GOM: 20–30°N, 100–80°W . Note that Figure 1 shows only the initial locations cyclogenesis of TCs, and the large number of locations indicates that the WNA is also a development region as well as the MDR. In 2005, most TCs developed over the WNA Figure 1 , including the two most destructive hurricanes Katrina and Rita, while the decrease of TCs over the WNA in 2007 is very clear in Figure 1 .The initial locations of tropical depressions yellow circles , tropical storms orange circles , and hurricanes red circles in the Atlantic basin overlapped with the June–July JJ mean dust aerosol optical depth from the MODIS for the period from a 2000 to 2007, b 2007, and c 2005. The color bar in Figure 1a is the same as in Figures 1b and 1c., clouds, and the depth of ocean mixed layer, etc. Lau and Kim  The SST's for both MDR and WNA in 2007 were lower than in 2005 but still above average values Table 1 . Evans showed that the 850 hPa specific humidity the ratio of water vapor to air over 5–25°N, and 90°W–20°E, may be linked to the frequency of intense hurricanes category 4 and 5 . Wu . The transport of dust and dry air was related to the low-middle level easterly winds. Figures 2a and 2b show that easterly winds at low to middle level 700–500 hPa mostly originated from Africa and stretched further to the western Atlantic region, transporting dust further westward in 2007 than in 2005 Figure 1b . As coincident with the easterly winds Figures 2a and 2b and dust aerosol distribution shown in Figures 1b and 1c , dry air RH < 35% in blue color extended further westward and lower levels in 2007 Figure 3c than in 2005 Figure 2d . As a result, the RH at 700 hPa was lower or the low-middle level air was drier in 2007 than in 2005. The decreasing relative humidity at 700 hPa is expected to increase the atmospheric stability and reduce convection. As such, fewer TCs developed over the WNA in 2007 Figure 1b as compared to 2005 Figure 1c .Cross section 15°N of U m/s, contours , U m/s and W -mb/s vectors during early summer June–July or JJ mean in a 2007 and b 2005 and cross section of RH 5 in c 2007 and d 2005. Please note the approximate longitude of the African coast on these plots is 16°W.Cross section 15°N of a temperature difference °C ; b U difference m/s, shaded and contours , zonal wind U m/s and vertical speed W -mb/s difference vectors between 2007 and 2005; c Wq difference -mb/s.g/kg; contours , Uq m/s.g/kg and Wq -mb/s.g/kg difference vectors; and d RH difference % during early summer JJ mean between 2007 and 2005. The approximate longitude of the African coast on these plots is 16°W.. The temperature difference between 2007 and 2005 Figure 3a reveals warming in the middle troposphere in the east dusty region, and cooling near the surface at the MDR. This is because the MDR is part of a larger region which is most frequently affected by dust. While in the western region, near-surface temperature was also lower in 2007 compared to 2005, but the cooling was much smaller than that in the MDR.. From the above analysis, we can see whether the dust aerosols and dry air transported to the WNA are most likely related to the low-middle level easterly winds which originated from Africa Figures 2a and 2b . To better quantify the advection effect, we define a zonal wind stretch index as the difference of low-middle level 600 hPa mean U-wind U 600 between the longitudes of 80°W and 60°W at 15° N latitude U stretch : U stretch is associated with large-scale air circulation pattern similar to “zonal stretching deformation” which affects hurricane activity. From equation 1 , negative positive value of U stretch means net easterly westerly wind acceleration across the longitude sector, and therefore a strong weak advection of dust to the WNA by easterly trades. Since the dust sources are over the Saharan desert, a high dust loading from advection over this longitudinal sector is likely to be associated with high dust loading in the upstream region over the eastern MDR. The U stretch is found to be correlated with the humidity averaged over the MDR r = 0.56 and WNA r U stretch , RH 700 = 0.69 with confidence level above 99%. This means that if the midlevel easterly winds can stretch further to the west, the dry air could be transported and spread to the WNA. Based on the expected lack of an El Niño event, the continuation of above average SSTs in the Atlantic MDR, and weak wind shear, many forecasters predicted a much above-normal hurricane season for 2007 http://typhoon.atmos.colostate.edu/forecasts/2007/nov2007/nov2007.pdf . However, the 2007 hurricane activity in the Atlantic basin was near normal., relative humidity and zonal wind index, we find that 2006 and 2007 were similar to each other and to the climatology, with slightly higher SSTs in the MDR and the WNA, and westward penetration of the Saharan dry air and dust. The hurricane season of 2005 was highly anomalous with significantly higher SST and higher relative humidity in the MDR and WNA. Most strikingly, the wind stretch index showed a large reversal from climatology, indicating highly suppressed advection of Saharan dry air and dust into the WNA. Based on the results presented, we conclude that the difference in westward penetration of the Saharan dry air and dust can be an important factor in contributing to the difference between the near- normal 2007 and 2006, and the very active 2005 hurricane seasons. Because the hurricane peak season in the Atlantic basin usually occurs during August–September–October ASO , the moisture field anomaly associated with peak dust aerosol outbreak during early summer before the peak hurricane season may have some practical implication for the prediction of Atlantic hurricane activities."
141,particles,"Modeling and observing the effect of aerosols on meteor radar measurements of the atmosphere. Measurements of the time taken for meteor radar echoes to decay can be used to estimate the ambipolar diffusion coefficient. If it is assumed that the decay of the radar echo is due strictly to the outward diffusion of ionized material in the meteor's trail, then echo decay is determined by temperature and pressure. However, dust particles or small ice crystals may absorb electrons from meteor trails, distorting their evolution and echo decay properties. A numerical method for modeling these processes is presented, with the prediction that absorbing aerosols can both decrease and increase the decay time of meteor radar echoes, depending on meteor, atmospheric, and radar parameters. This prediction is confirmed with observations taken using three 33 MHz and two 55 MHz radars at three locations in Australia and Antarctica, which display strong biases in the decay times of lower power echoes. It is suggested that both the accuracy and precision of atmospheric measurements are improved if only the highest power meteor echoes are used for estimates of the ambipolar diffusion coefficient. . The loss of free electrons by attachment to aerosols can alter the trail's radio scattering behavior, causing deviation from the strictly exponential decay seen in underdense meteor radar echoes. Measurements of meteor diffusion coefficients gathered at Davis Station, Antarctica over 2006 showed a strong dependence on the frequency of the observing radar. Additionally, observations described by  The ionized material in the trail diffuses outward at a rate determined by the local temperature and pressure, as described in the diffusion equation: where D is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient. If a Gaussian initial density distribution is used, an analytic solution is possible. The result of diffusion is then an exponential decay in the scattered signal with the time taken to decay by a factor of e −1 of . With the input of the missing term from another sensor or an atmospheric model, temperature or pressure can be estimated.  Jones  Of particular importance was the selection of the electron capture rate, R ed , which is a function of electron temperature, particle radius, and particle charge. Following the calculations described by Rapp  Decay curves were constructed from the scattering amplitude over time for a 33MHz and a 55MHz radar, which were compared with the theoretical decay of trail echoes due to diffusion only. The results predicted that meteors with high initial electron line densities will be relatively unaffected by the presence of absorbing aerosols. The reason behind the rather counter-intuitive prediction of extended decay times lies in the physics of the formation of the meteor echo and the timing and location of the absorption of electrons from the meteor trail. Equation 1 , which gives the amplitude of radiation scattered from a trail is a convolution of two terms: the radial density profile and a weighting function based on the distance from the trail axis and a Bessel function of wavelength and radial distance. The density profile is approximately Gaussian and the weighting function is periodic with increasing amplitude, which are shown together for comparison at the two wavelengths considered in Figure 2 .Weighting functions rJ 0 4 πr / λ for 33 MHz light and 55 MHz dark radars. A Gaussian density profile with a 1.0 m radius dashed is shown for comparison... An 80 km floor for the data provided adequate detections at both frequencies. For the 55 MHz radars at Buckland Park and Davis Station, extended decay times were observed for weak meteors at all altitudes at all times. All 33 MHz detections obtained from the Darwin 2006 data and the month of 33 MHz testing at Buckland Park exhibited decreased decay times for weak meteors in the 80–86km region. This was repeated in spring and autumn in the 33 MHz observations from Davis Station, but extended decay times were observed for weak meteors at 33 MHz over the Antarctic winter and January-December. and Cervera and Reid  Two possibilities may account for the seemingly incongruous behavior of the Davis Station 33 MHz observations in summer and winter. Firstly, the model predictions do not take into account the possibility of multiple absorptions by a single particle, which would be the case in the summer months when large PMSE-related ice crystals could act as electron scavengers in the mesosphere. Secondly, dramatic seasonal density variations were noted in the form of a mean detection altitude that was 3 km lower in winter than in summer at both frequencies. Such a change in local atmospheric parameters complicates comparisons of observations acquired at the same geometric height between different seasons. The clear prediction of the model was that meteors with low initial electron line density would be most affected by aerosols, with little to no effect on denser trails. This was seen in the dependence of the deviation between the Davis Station 33 and 55 MHz radars' estimates of D on the strength of the echoes being compared. This effect was sharply peaked in summer, when the polar mesosphere reaches the coldest temperature in the terrestrial environment. The attendant cessation of sublimation results in the formation of PMSE-related ice crystals in the mesosphere, which could be capable of absorbing significant numbers of free electrons.[21]  The observation of converging estimates of the ambipolar diffusion coefficient with increasing meteor strength, as well as frequency-dependent biases between weak and strong meteors, serve to reinforce the conclusion that underdense meteors with low initial electron line density are affected by absorptive processes related to the presence of dust and ice particles in the upper atmosphere.[22]  In light of these findings, future attempts to use underdense meteor radar echo decay times to estimate atmospheric temperature and pressure should rely on only higher power detections, corresponding to meteor trails with higher electron line densities. An advantage of such selectivity is that the statistical spread in results will actually be smaller, despite eliminating a large portion of gathered data, due to the removal of aerosol-introduced biases. Additionally, the estimates made will be more accurate, as the high power echoes are significantly less affected by absorption. Meteor observations taking into account absorptive phenomena will provide a valuable source of reliable observations to be used in conjunction with other sensors or as an absolute check of empirical models."
142,aerosol,"Surface wind accuracy for modeling mineral dust emissions: Comparing two regional models in a Bodele case study. After a decade of research on improving the description of surface and soil features in desert regions to accurately model mineral dust emissions, we now emphasize the need for deeper evaluating the accuracy of modeled 10-m surface wind speeds U-10. Two mesoscale models, the Lokal-Modell LM and the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System RAMS , coupled with an explicit dust emission model have previously been used to simulate mineral dust events in the Bodele region. We compare LM and RAMS U-10, together with measurements at the Chicha site BoDEx campaign and Faya-Largeau meteorological station. Surface features and soil schemes are investigated to correctly simulate U-10 intensity and diurnal variability. The uncertainties in dust emissions computed with LM and RAMS U-10 and different soil databases are estimated. This sensitivity study shows the importance of accurate computation of surface winds to improve the quantification of regional dust emissions from the Bodele.  provide a physical description of the main processes involved in dust production erosion threshold, saltation and sandblasting . They allow describing the spatio-temporal variability of the non-linear phenomenon of dust production if their input parameters surface and soil features, surface winds are accurately described.. Accurate surface roughness hereafter B07 tested the ability of the LM and RAMS v.4.3.0 non-hydrostatic meteorological models to reproduce small-scale features associated with a dust event during the BoDEx period. LM is the operational weather prediction model of the German weather service Deutscher Wetterdienst DWD . It is operated with initial and boundary conditions from the Global Modell Europa GME of the DWD. RAMS was developed at the Colorado State University with the Mission Research Corporation MRC/ASTeR. It is initialized and laterally nudged every 6 hours by European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting ECMWF reanalysis data.. T06 used as input parameter the surface roughness derived from POLDER-1 surface products  T06 performed the first dust mesoscale study over the Bodélé using LM , a hourly RAMS U 10 red triangle and new RAMS U 10 black star , and b hourly LM U 10 red triangle and new LM U 10 black star . The dashed lines correspond to the estimated wind speed thresholds.. Z 0LM database is used to compute mesoscale meteorological parameters, but to compute the 10-m wind speeds from the 1st level wind speeds, the use of the Z 0P1 database, which characterizes the aerodynamic surface roughness length with a fine resolution and well-represents the surface roughness variability at Chicha and Faya, seems more relevant. New LM U 10 are computed using a logarithmic profile in neutral stability conditions equation 1 and Z 0P1 instead of Z 0LM at Chicha and Faya. The new LM U 10 are 12% higher than the original LM U 10 Figure 2b , and better agree with the highest wind speeds measured during daytime. The increase in the nighttime wind discrepancy does not affect emission too much because winds are more likely to be below the emission threshold..Hourly dust fluxes gcm −2 s −1 computed for March 9–12 using Laurent's soil and Tegen's soil at a, b Chicha and c, d Faya, with LM U 10 , new LM U 10 , RAMS U 10 and new RAMS U 10 .Dust emissions are given in gm −2 ., and Niger 0.28 ms −1 < U* < 0.50 ms −1 . At Faya, the dust fluxes computed with the 2 soil datasets are similar for low winds, the fluxes computed with Tegen's soil being larger for the high winds Figures 3c and 3d . The dust flux temporal variability is also more pronounced with LM winds than with RAMS winds, even if the dust event peaks are now more marked using the new RAMS. The maximum flux is simulated on March 10 in the morning with the LM, new LM, RAMS and new RAMS winds 9 10 −8 gcm −2 s −1 , 3.5 10 −7 gcm −2 s −1 , 4.4 10 −7 gcm −2 s −1 , and 5.8 10 −7 gcm −2 s −1 with Tegen's soil, respectively . The AOT measurements at Chicha and the horizontal visibilities measured at Faya are insufficient to determine which simulation is more realistic. estimated an emission of 324 gm −2 ±40% from sunphotometer retrievals of dust volume at Chicha and assuming the total exposed diatomite layer ∼10.8 10 9 m 2 being a dust source. T06 simulated a dust emission of 104 gm −2 using a corrective factor on the erosion threshold to compensate for the too low LM U 10 . In fact, the emission simulated at Chicha using the original LM winds 29 to 56 gm −2 seems to be underestimated. The emission computed with the new LM U 10 and Tegen's soil is 122 gm −2 , slightly higher than the estimation of T06. The new LM U 10 thus provides satisfactory dust emission without lowering the erosion threshold using a corrective factor. The emissions simulated with the new LM 122 to 191 gm −2 , RAMS 344 to 502 gm −2 , and new RAMS 341 to 496 gm −2 winds are in the same range as the previous estimations. Using RAMS v.6.0, the diurnal variability of the winds is more pronounced and leads to larger dust emissions during the day and lower during the night than using the former RAMS v.4.3.0 Figures 3b and 3d .[25]  The emission difference due to the two soil databases is around 35% at Chicha and 20% at Faya for the largest simulated emissions and can reach 50% and 30% for the lowest emissions, respectively. The emission difference due to the four wind databases is more than a factor 11 at Chicha and a factor 20 at Faya. If we just consider the emissions computed with the new LM U 10 and new RAMS U 10 , which better agree with in-situ surface wind measurements than the former LM and RAMS U 10 , the dust emission difference is around 65%. These results confirm the importance of representing as accurately as possible the U 10 to simulate dust emissions.[26]  The comparisons of U 10 from simulations by LM and RAMS mesoscale models as well as in-situ measurements highlight the limitations of such models to reproduce correctly both the intensity and the diurnal cycle of the 10-m winds in the Bodélé. Nevertheless, the new RAMS U 10 computed using the RAMS v.6.0 new soil scheme better reproduce the diurnal wind cycle in agreement with in-situ measurements. Moreover, the new LM U 10 computed using Z 0P1 values are 12% higher than the original LM U 10 and better agree with the maximum wind speeds measured at Chicha and Faya during daytime dust events. The soil scheme and then the soil-atmosphere heat budget appears as a key parameter to model the diurnal variability of surface winds. We also highlight that Z 0 is a key parameter to compute U 10 . As already mentionned in mesoscale studies, further investigations on the subgrid scale topography horizontal resolution , and the developing boundary layers parameterizations, vertical resolution would be also benefit to accurately represent the surface meteorological parameters, especially U 10 .[27]  Testing several wind and soil databases, we find that the major uncertainty in the mesoscale computation of dust emissions at Chicha and Faya is due to U 10 . For the dusty period of March 10–12, the total simulated dust emissions range from 29 to 502 gm −2 at Chicha, and from 24 to 489 gm −2 at Faya. The emission difference due to the two soil databases is larger for the lowest simulated emissions and can reach 50% at Chicha and 30% at Faya. The difference due to the four wind databases reaches more than one order of magnitude, but just 65% when the most relevant winds new LM and new RAMS U 10 are considered. As the new LM U 10 , the new RAMS U 10 allow simulating several dust events on March 10-12 instead of permanent emissions using the RAMS U 10 which do not satisfactorily reproduce the wind diurnal variability for this period. These results illustrate the gains that can be obtained using a more accurate description of surfaces to compute U 10 in the Bodélé and the large uncertainties still existing in the mesoscale modeling of mineral dust."
143,impact clouds aerosol,"Possible linkages between Saharan dust and tropical cyclone rain band invigoration in the eastern Atlantic during NAMMA-06. The Saharan Air Layer SAL is a dominant feature that influences the large-scale environment from West Africa to the western tropical North Atlantic. While the SAL can create hostile thermodynamic and kinematic environmental conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, it also provides an infusion of cloud condensation and ice nuclei which can potentially invigorate convection. Here we show that these mechanisms may have been involved with the development of Tropical Storm TS Debby and Tropical Depression TD 8 later Hurricane Helene in 2006. Satellite imagery and rawinsondes indicate SAL outbreaks just prior to the emergence of these disturbances over the extreme Eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. Here we examine the invigoration of convective bands associated with TS Debby and TD-8 based on satellite and direct aircraft measurement. In-situ aircraft measurements show enhanced cloud water content, cloud and precipitation sized particles, lightning and a 26 ms-1 updraft just south of the SAL with TD-8. . The Sahara Desert and Sahel are the primary sources of aerosols that are transported across the tropical Atlantic. During the Northern Hemisphere NH winter season, the direct effects seem more dominant with reduced visibilities from dust in Cape Verde when compared to the NH summer season. However, the indirect effects may significantly influence precipitation in the Sahelian region.. Relatively cool, moist marine air undercuts the SAL as it moves westward. Typically, the SAL resides between 850–500 hPa in height and is bound by an enhanced trade wind inversion at its base.. These AEWs are also the primary source of Atlantic Tropical Cyclones TCs . The interaction of the SAL with AEWs and their role in tropical cyclone evolution remains an area of active research. In particular there is evidence to support the SAL acting to weaken tropical cyclones but also evidence suggesting that aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions from the SAL can invigorate convective bands in tropical cyclones. noted that the SAL raises the Lifted Condensation Level LCL and Level of Free Convection LFC , making it more difficult for deep convection to develop. using an idealized tropical cyclone show that using high aerosol concentrations 2000 cm −3 between 1–5 km , representative of the SAL produced a higher sea level pressure and weaker maximum winds in the tropical cyclone consistent with the studies above. found that Saharan dust caused glaciation of altocumulus clouds at unusually warm temperatures. 3 and during the August/September 2006 and denoted as NASA-AMMA NAMMA . This component includes: aircraft and enhanced ground measurements in West Africa and Cape Verde. The NASA DC-8 was equipped with radar, microwave sounding capability, lidar, GPS dropsondes and cloud microphysics sensors. These sensors include the Cloud, Aerosol and Precipitation Spectrometer CAPS , and counterflow virtual impactor CVI that measures the condensed water content. These measurements over the Tropical Eastern Atlantic are the first where aircraft have successfully investigated tropical cyclogenesis in close proximity to the African continent. are used precipitation radar PR and TRMM Microwave Imager TMI 85 GHz polarization corrected temperatures PCT , latent heat rate, IR and lightning measurements . Aerosol optical thicknesses AOT derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS on the Aqua satellite are used for identifying SAL outbreaks. The tropical disturbance became more organized on August 21st with a TRMM overpass showing cloud temperatures at the vortex center below 210°K at 0122–0124 UTC on August 21st Figure 1c . An outer band to the northeast of the vortex, which passed over western Senegal also exhibited temperatures below 210°K. The TRMM PR shows the maximum within the entire vertical scan radar reflectivies of 40 dBZ over the ocean but the small swath-width of the PR did not cover the convective rain band over land Figure 1d . The TRMM TMI however, with its larger swath-width did capture the convective band over land. This band is associated with a considerable amount of ice scattering based on PCTs being less than 120°K Figure 1e . The lower PCTs over land than the vortex in the marine environment, suggest greater convective strength over land. The latent heat release estimated from TMI is greater than 20° C/h over Senegal at 10 km implying a considerable amount of ice formation. Observations of lightning flashes, often an indication of convective strength, was also observed in much higher quantities than over the oceanic convective center; the TRMM Lightning Imaging Sensor LIS measured 131 flashes within two minutes in the vicinity of Dakar in the area of highest latent heat release, low PCT and low cloud top temperatures between 0122 and 0124 UTC. Based on the afore-mentioned TRMM observations and rawinsonde data, we infer that the SAL influenced cloud-microphysical properties and hence convection associated with the genesis of TS Debby where observations show cold cloud tops, elevated ice concentrations, elevated latent heat release and frequent lightning. Further suggestions of dust impacting the development of TD 8 can be seen in Figure 3a . The Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment LASE instrument aboard the DC-8 revealed the presence of Saharan dust extending from the ocean surface up to nearly 5 km in altitude, just to the north and west of the system. The depth of SAL is reduced as the DC-8 enters the convection. While most prevalent on the northwestern side of the system, MODIS AOT measurements Figure 2b show dust wrapping around the western and even southern sides of the circulation. As mentioned above, the convection associated with TD 8 was most intense on the western side of the system with an updraft of approximately 26 m-s −1 50 knots measured by the DC-8 as it was traversing this convection from west to east Figure 3b between 1245–1300 UTC. This updraft is the strongest ever encountered by the DC-8 or other research aircraft investigating tropical cyclones. GPS dropsondes released from the DC-8 at 1220 UTC and 1242 UTC Figures 3c – 3d reveal a strong temperature inversion and sharp drop-off in dew point just above the marine boundary layer associated with the SAL. The strong mid-level jet associated with the SAL can also be seen in the wind profile from these two dropsondes. Based on the GPS dropsonde at 1242 UTC, we would expect an entrainment of dust particle at altitudes greater than 825 hPa level where the base of the inversion is found. a 1200–1248 UTC LASE imagery of aerosol scattering and water vapor mixing ratio, b vertical updraft speed in m/s and altitude in mb from 1245–1300 UTC, c dropsonde temperature and dew point profile for 1220 UTC, and d 1242 UTC. In this paper we have shown measurements that support the hypothesis that Saharan dust may have led to invigoration of rain bands associated with tropical cyclogenesis. The results are based on satellite observations/rawinsondes associated with TS Debby and aircraft measurements of TD 8 during the 2006 NAMMA field campaign. The evidence includes: observed SAL outbreaks and associated dust particles inferred from aircraft lidar and MODIS AOT values, strong vertical updrafts during TD-8 of 26 ms −1 50 knots , large precipitation sized particles and high cloud water content, lightning, significant ice concentrations in the upper parts of the system - as measured by aircraft and satellite.[17]  There are still many questions about both systems with regard to internal processes, which cannot be fully addressed due to incomplete measurements. A primary question surrounds the role of Saharan dust serving as IN, which would lead to stronger convection as suggested by [2003] . Although IN concentrations were not directly measured during NAMMA flights, we believe that they were indeed enhanced because of the close proximity to the Sahara. Modeling studies will be required to constrain the limited NAMMA measurements. The results presented here suggest that the SAL and potential aerosol-cloud microphysics impacts on convection cannot be neglected and could be a key factor in the intensity of convection associated with TC genesis in the extreme Tropical Eastern Atlantic."
150,dust atmosphere aerosol climate ocean,"Observations of enhanced aerosol longwave radiative forcing over an urban environment. Collocated measurements of sun/ sky radiance, aerosol chemical composition and radiative fluxes have been utilized to estimate longwave aerosol radiative forcing over Pune, an Indian urban site during dry winter [Dec2004 to Feb2005] by two methods. Hybrid method which uses observed downwelling and modeled upwelling longwave fluxes for different aerosol loadings yielded a surface forcing of 9.4 Wm -2 . Model approach includes utilization of skyradiometer derived spectral aerosol optical properties in the visible and near infra-red wavelengths, modeled aerosol properties in 1.2-40 mu m using observed soot and chemical composition data, MODIS water vapor and TOMS column ozone in a radiative transfer model. Estimates from model method showed longwave enhancement of 6.5 and 8.2Wm -2 at the surface with tropical model atmosphere and temporally varying profiles of temperature and humidity, respectively. Study reveals that about 25% of the aerosol shortwave cooling is being compensated by increase in longwave radiation due to aerosol absorption. , which results in a net cooling at the earth's surface. But studies are sparse as far as aerosol-longwave interaction is concerned and commonly been ignored in climate models. But, it is shown that longwave aerosol radiative forcing LWARF is of comparable magnitude as that of greenhouse gases in heating the earth's surface and in modifying the earth's energy balance. It is also pointed out that neglecting LWARF can cause large errors in climate models. Direct observations of aerosol longwave forcing are rare either at the surface, in the atmosphere, or at the top of the atmosphere. Thus, our understandings of LWARF are mostly model-based with a few direct observations for validations. In this scenario, we are presenting two approaches for estimating the LWARF viz. hybrid and model methods. Model approach includes utilization of observed aerosol optical properties in the visible and near infra-red spectral regions using a skyradiometer and OPAC Optical properties of Aerosols and Clouds -derived aerosol optical properties in the longwave spectral region using observed black carbon soot , water-soluble and acid-soluble chemical components. In the hybrid method, half-hourly averaged long-wave radiation data from a Pyrgeometer in the spectral range 4–50  The output parameters used from the model were the surface downward and upward LW radiation per wavelength interval between 4 and 50 Calculated daily mean LWARF has been correlated with daily mean AOD value to estimate forcing efficiency F eff . Forcing efficiency radiative forcing per unit optical depth at 0.5 μ m estimated is found to be 24.8 and 20.8 Wm −2 , respectively at the surface by hybrid and model methods Figure 3 .LW Forcing efficiency at surface obtained at 0.50 μ m through a Hybrid method and b Model method with NCEP profiles.. This study shows on an average, a forcing of about 8 Wm −2 in the longwave spectral region. This suggests that about 25% of the SW cooling is being compensated by increase in atmospheric LW radiation, due to aerosol absorption over urban environments.. Thus, aerosol IR forcing of the magnitudes here can modify the surface energy balance by a magnitude that may be important for the climate. Our analysis indicates that since aerosol longwave forcing estimated here are comparable to that of greenhouse forcing, it should be included in climate models wherever greenhouse contribution is included."
145,aerosol,"Dust and sea surface temperature forcing of the 1930s ""Dust Bowl"" drought. Droughts over the central United States US are modulated by sea surface temperature SST variations in the eastern tropical Pacific. Many models, however, are unable to reproduce the severity and spatial pattern of the ""Dust Bowl'' drought of the 1930s with SST forcing alone. We force an atmosphere general circulation model with 1930s SSTs and model-generated dust emission from the Great Plains region. The SSTs alone force a drought over the US similar to observations, but with a weaker precipitation anomaly that is centered too far south. Inclusion of dust radiative forcing, centered over the area of observed wind erosion, increases the intensity of the drought and shifts its center northward. While our conclusions are tempered by limited quantitative observations of the dust aerosol load and soil erosion during this period, our study suggests that unprecedented atmospheric dust loading over the continental US exacerbated the ""Dust Bowl'' drought. . Examples over North America include droughts during the 1950s and latter part of the 19th century, as well as the most recent and ongoing drought in the western US. Modeling evidence suggests SST forcing was at least partially responsible for the drought during the 1930s known as the “Dust Bowl”. Models, however, have difficulty reproducing the severity and spatial pattern of the Dust Bowl drought, instead producing droughts that, while superficially similar to observations, are too weak and centered in the southwest rather than the central and northern Great Plains as observed. .. High wind erosion resulted from a variety of convergent factors, including low soil moisture from the drought, poor land use practices, and the replacement of drought resistant native grasslands with drought susceptible wheat crops. Recent studies have shown the potential for high dust loading in the atmosphere to suppress precipitation. Dust effectively scatters and absorbs shortwave radiation while absorbing and emitting longwave radiation. By reducing the net radiation into the surface beneath the aerosol layer, dust reduces evaporation and thus precipitation. There is thus a strong potential for dust forcing to exacerbate drought during the Dust Bowl. Here we investigate the contribution of SST and dust radiative forcing to the 1930s Dust Bowl drought, using a state of the art atmosphere general circulation model coupled to a dust emission and transport model. We consider the effects of SST forcing alone, and the influence of SST in combination with dust radiative forcing.. Simulations of modern day climate in ModelE compare favorably with observations, with some notable biases, particularly in the subtropical marine stratocumulus regions. ModelE is unusually successful at simulating the observed annual cycle of precipitation over the Great Plains and Mexico, along with interannual variations in precipitation during the second half of the 20th century. We use a version of ModelE coupled to a model of mineral dust aerosols. Given “natural” dust sources i.e., excluding sources created by anthropgenic land degradation and forced by present day ModelE climate, the dust model reproduces within the range of observational uncertainty the seasonal atmospheric dust cycle, as well as the magnitude and pattern of atmospheric dust loading. Dust within the model interacts with radiation in ModelE absorbing, emitting, and reflecting longwave and shortwave , but does not impact cloud microphysics. . Emission as a function of wind speed is scaled so that the dust cycle from natural sources generally agrees with a worldwide array of observations. However, sources created by land degradation are expected to be initially more vulnerable to wind erosion, resulting in greater emission compared to natural sources. We specify the disturbed sources over the Great Plains to be three times more productive compared to natural sources for a given wind event. We experimented with a range of dust source magnitudes and found emissions over the region scaled roughly linearly with the size of the specified Great Plains dust source. While the precise expansion and productivity of dust sources due to land degradation is not known, we try to constrain this below by comparing the additional dust emission by agricultural sources to estimates of observed soil loss during the Dust Bowl.. Net dust emission from the model for 1935 is of the same order of magnitude, but only about half of the 771 million metric tons needed to match observations. A comparison between atmospheric dust loading from this experiment Figure 2 and more qualitative dust storm maps from the period not shown suggests that the spatial pattern of atmospheric loading is reasonable. For the moment, we note that the productivity of disturbed sources compared to natural ones is a fundamental uncertainty that can be resolved only with more definitive observations of the aerosol load and soil erosion during the Dust Bowl.Net dust emissions emission-deposition for the Dust Bowl source region 34°N-48°N, 102.5°W-92.5°W , for each member of the SST+Dust ensemble.

Outlined are the eight grid boxes that constitute the new dust source in the SST+Dust experiments. and our model experiments, averaged over the central US, the center of action for the Dust Bowl drought 30°N–48°N, 105°W–85°W . All anomalies for the model and GHCN data are relative to the 1920–1929 average, a period of fairly wet conditions over the US. The model, forced with 1932–1939 SSTs alone, produces a drying as seen in the GHCN data, with a reduced magnitude. Nonetheless, ∼71% of the total of 40 simulated years within the 5 ensemble members were drier than the ensemble mean for the 1920s simulation. When dust forcing is included with the SST forcing, the drought intensifies, as seen in the overall shift of the distribution towards negative precipitation anomalies. The spatial pattern and intensity of the drought also changes with the inclusion of dust Figure 4 . SST forcing alone leads to fairly muted precipitation anomalies in the central plains; the resulting pattern is not dry enough and the drought extends much too far south into northern Mexico. With SST+Dust forcing, the drought intensifies and the center of drying moves north and east. Several notable differences between model and observations remain. In the model, the center of drought is shifted too far to the northeast, leading to a Great Lakes region that is too dry. The drought also does not extend far enough north, into the central Canadian plains. Parts of Mexico still show a dry anomaly, contrary to the GHCN dataset that actually shows a wet anomaly over much of Mexico. The intensity of the precipitation anomalies varied with the magnitude of our dust source, but the spatial pattern remained essentially unchanged not shown . As with other studies, our model is unable to reproduce the large warming during the drought not shown . It remains unclear how much of the discrepancy with observations results from uncertainty in the dust sources, compared to factors not considered here. In our experiments, the mechanisms for precipitation reductions associated with increased dust loading are consistent with other studies where reduced net radiation into the surface beneath the dust layer reduces evaporation and precipitation. We subtract using the ensemble mean results SST forcing from the SST+Dust forcing experiments to examine the added effect of dust. Increased atmospheric dust loading in the SST+Dust case Figure 2 leads to reductions in net surface radiation auxiliary material Figure S1 , centered under the region of highest atmospheric dust loading. Reductions in surface radiation drive reductions in surface evaporation and latent heating auxiliary material Figure S2 , leading to a negative precipitation feedback. Evaporative and soil moisture feedbacks during the Dust Bowl drought are supported by a previous study Schubert et al., 2004 .Box and whisker plots for precipitation anomalies, averaged over the central United States 30°N-48°N, 105°W-85°W . Shown are data from the GHCN dataset and output from the three ModelE experiments: SST forcing 1920–1929 , SST forcing 1932–1939 , and SST+Dust forcing 1932–1939 . For GHCN data, anomalies are relative to GHCN data for 1920–1929. For model experiments, anomalies are relative to the SST forcing 1920–1929 experiment. Plots for the GHCN anomalies are based on 10 years 1920–1929 and 8 years 1932–1939 ; for the model output, each plot represents output from five member ensembles simulations; 50 years for 1920–1929 and 40 years for 1932–1939.Spatial extent and magnitude of precipitation anomalies. Anomalies are relative to the same reference period in Figure 3 .. It is still possible the drought resulted from SST forcing and internal variability. Large model ensembles include individual ensemble members that bear a closer resemblance to the Dust Bowl drought, even with SST forcing only. These patterns, however, disappear in the ensemble averages.[9]  Results here are preliminary, and serve as a starting point for future work. The dust emission and source productivity, for example, should be better constrained. Indeed, the balance of evidence suggests that the modeled dust emission is smaller than what actually occurred and, hence, the results presented here may underestimate the impacts of Dust Bowl wind erosion. Thus, our study identifies the quantitative calculation of net soil loss and the pattern of the aerosol burden resulting from disturbed sources as key prerequisites for understanding the singular magnitude of the Dust Bowl."
367,aerosol,"Comment on ""Dust provenance in Antarctic ice during glacial periods: From where in southern South America?'' by D. M. Gaiero.   Electron microscope microparticle investigations suggested southern South America as dominant mineral dust supplier to East Antarctica Vostok and Dome C during LGM. Chemical data supported this hypothesis, showing an agreement between Antarctic dust and high-altitude subtropical Andean deserts. and to different drilling sites within the Antarctic Plateau. The good isotopic matching between Antarctic glacial dust and Argentinean loess Figure 1 corroborated the idea of a dominant South American origin for Antarctic dust during late Quaternary glacial ages. By pushing mass spectrometry to extreme thresholds, some data for the Holocene and MIS 5.5 are also available today. Despite the relatively large error of measurements due to the very small amount of dust extracted from interglacial ice 20 μg on average , Holocene and MIS 5.5 dust displays an overall isotopic signature significantly less radiogenic in Neodymium than glacial dust Figure 1 and definitely falling outside the southern South American isotopic field constructed on the basis of dust and sediment samples collected at latitudes higher than 32°S.Strontium and Neodymium isotopic composition of East Antarctic eaolian dust from glacial and from interglacial Holocene and MIS 5.5 stages.

Some of their data came very close to interglacial Antarctic dust, suggesting a possible contribution from Australia during warm stages. Yet, the problem was not definitely solved, as a Sr isotopic shift between interglacial Antarctic dust and Australian data still existed and it could not be properly explained. and Argentinean loess are accessible. In addition, Gaiero . The author concludes that a direct transport of mineral dust from these two areas to Antarctica occurred during Pleistocene glacial times. support the hypothesis of an additional volcanic sulfate component in the sulfate budget of Vostok ice for glacial conditions. In the light of Gaiero . In the hypothesis of a bipolar mixing between the two south American sources, during interglacial stages the high-altitude subtropical dust source can be thought to have been relatively more important for the East Antarctic plateau than during glacials, and conversely for the Patagonian source. Indeed, a remarkable isotopic matching exists between interglacial dust in Antarctica and high-altitude > ∼5500 m a.s.l. subtropical sites from the Central Andean Volcanic Zone 21–23°S, bibliographic data corrected for the Sr isotopic fractionation as suggested by Gaiero . These evidences must be confirmed by additional data; however, overall they point to a connection between high-elevation subtropical Andean deserts and the high Plateau of Antarctica during the Holocene and Quaternary interglacial times."
148,ocean,"What does temporal variability in aeolian dust deposition contribute to sea-surface iron and chlorophyll distributions?. Dust deposition is extremely variable over all timescales. Yet the impact of this variability on ocean biogeochemistry is currently not known, at least on the global scale. Here, we force a global model of ocean biogeochemistry over 1996 to 2001 with daily fields of dust deposition simulated by an atmospheric aerosol model. Our model results suggest that dust deposition explains a large part of the temporal variability of surface iron in the tropical regions and in part of the subarctic Pacific. However, while dust deposition is dominated by daily events, its impact on surface iron is maximal on interannual timescales. The largest fluctuations of surface iron produced by dust occur in oligotrophic regions where phytoplankton growth is not primarily controlled by iron availability. Consequently, the variability of surface chlorophyll induced by aerosol iron is predicted to be very small everywhere, especially relative to the impact of the ocean dynamics. . This micro-nutrient is supplied to the surface ocean from three different sources: 1 dust deposition from the atmosphere, 2 vertical transport of subsurface waters, and 3 vertical and lateral transport from sediment mobilization and hydrothermal vents for a review, see de Baar and de Jong . Consequently, and as already suggested for the Last Glacial Maximum, any temporal change in its magnitude could potentially impact surface iron and chlorophyll.. The impact of such variability on ocean biogeochemistry has been previously studied on long time scales globally. On the other hand, some studies have analyzed this impact on short time scales, typically from days to seasons and at very specific sites in the North Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Yet, the impact of atmospheric iron supply on daily to interannual variability in ocean biogeochemistry has been thus far unaddressed on a global scale. a Annual mean atmospheric deposition of iron in mmol Fe/m 2 /year averaged over 1996–2001. Variability in dust deposition percent on b seasonal, c interannual and d daily time-scales.. PISCES includes four Plankton Functional Groups Diatoms, Nanophytoplankton, Microzooplankton, Mesozooplankton . Phytoplankton growth is limited by five different nutrients NO3, NH4, PO4, SiO3 and Fe and light. Dissolved iron is represented via one single dissolved pool with a basic description of iron-ligand interactions. Iron is scavenged by both organic and inorganic particles, either by coagulation of the complexed forms or by direct adsorption of the free inorganic pool. Three external sources of iron are considered in the model: dust deposition see below , sediment mobilization and river discharge. A complete description as well as a short evaluation of the model are provided as supplementary material to the work by Aumont and Bopp which was forced with atmospheric fields from the ERA-40 re-analysis over 1996–2001.. Forced by this emission scheme, the atmospheric dust cycle is simulated using the LMDzT atmospheric model coupled to the INCA aerosol module. Realistic variations of synoptic weather are achieved by nudging to reanalysed winds from ECMWF. The LMDzT-INCA dust cycle was characterised recently in the AeroCom model intercomparison and shown to provide one of several valid global dust models.. As already shown, daily variability is by far the largest due to the highly episodic nature of dust transport Figure 1c . The three types of variability daily, seasonal, interannual generally display similar spatial patterns. In particular, the high dust regions do not necessarily exhibit the largest variability. Variability is also large at high latitudes, as a result of the interactions between dust transport and precipitation.. In the subtropical gyre of the southern Pacific ocean, surface iron concentrations show the smallest variations due to very stable physical conditions and low and constant dust deposition. The variability is maximal at high latitudes and in the equatorial Pacific.Temporal variability in surface dissolved iron over 1996–2001 percent . a Variability induced both by variations in dust deposition and in ocean circulation/climate forcing. Variability induced by variations in dust deposition on b seasonal, c interannual and d daily time-scales. The annual-mean surface iron distribution can be inferred from Aumont and Bopp . Interestingly, there is no obvious relationship between the magnitude of the variability in dust deposition and its impact on the variability of surface iron. In particular, the response of iron concentrations to daily variations in the atmospheric supply of iron is the smallest Figure 2d whereas the latter variations were shown to largely dominate the temporal signal of dust deposition. Interannual variations in dust deposition induce the largest temporal fluctuations in surface iron. Figures 3a – 3b . It is beyond the scope of this study to present a full description of this variability, which was already analysed in previous regional or global studies. However, we show that the variability induced by dust deposition is negligible almost everywhere and for all types of temporal variability Figure 3c . Very small daily and interannual variations in chlorophyll are only produced at the southern limit of the Pacific subpolar gyre and on the northern edge of the eastern equatorial Pacific. a Annual mean surface chlorophyll concentrations simulated by PISCES and averaged over 1997–2001 in mg Chl a/m 3 . Temporal variability in surface chlorophyll in mg Chl a/m 3 over 1997–2001. b Variability deduced from SeaWiFS satellite data. c Variability predicted by the model induced both by variations in dust deposition and in ocean circulation/climate forcing. d Variability induced by daily, seasonal and interannual variations in dust deposition. The latter variability has been computed from the difference between the climatological simulation forced by the daily dust deposition fields and the climatological simulation driven by annual-mean dust deposition see the methodology section . All variabilities have been computed from 8 days-mean fields both for SeaWiFS and PISCES., in the northern subtropical Pacific and in the northern subtropical Atlantic. In agreement with these observations, our model results suggest that the eolian imprint on the temporal variability in iron is significant in the tropical regions and part of the subpolar Pacific. This imprint is predicted to be negligible elsewhere. Such result is not surprising as a significant ocean response to any atmospheric supply requires a large dust supply, a shallow mixed layer depth and a small iron consumption by either biological activity or scavenging/coagulation. All these conditions are met in the subtropical gyres and in part of the subpolar Pacific ocean.. The modeled variability over similar timescales is rather modest, with maximum variations of about 0.2 nM Fe in the northern subtropical gyre of the Atlantic ocean. Differences in the solubility of aerosol iron may explain this disparity. In our model, this solubility has been set to 1%, a value typically prescribed in ocean biogeochemical models. Yet, values up to 40% have been deduced from short-term variations in surface iron concentrations. Nevertheless, prescribing such high values in ocean models yields unrealistic surface iron distributions. Three potential factors may explain this apparent inconsistency. First, the rather simplistic description of the iron cycle in biogeochemical models might be incomplete. Second, solubility of aerosol iron is strongly variable both over time and space and not constant as assumed in our model. Third, processes other than dust deposition may explain the observed rapid variations in surface iron, such as mesoscale dynamics.. As a consequence, any change in iron does not result in a modification of the phytoplankton biomass. On the other hand, in the High Nutrient-Low Chlorophyll regions in which iron is a limiting factor, dust deposition over all timescales from days to years remains too small to have any noticeable impact on surface chlorophyll."
155,aerosol,"Long-term variability in Saharan dust transport and its link to North Atlantic sea surface temperature. An understanding of the atmospheric distribution of Saharan dust is crucial for understanding many Earth-system processes. We demonstrate here a model simulation indicating that the August-September dust amount in the Tropical Atlantic is linked to the basin-wide North Atlantic sea surface temperature SST . The increasing SSTs from 1979 to 2005 are associated with a strengthening cyclonic anomaly at 700 hPa in the tropical East Atlantic, reducing Saharan dust outflow into the Tropical Atlantic at latitudes between 10 degrees-20 degrees N. A decreasing dust amount over the same region is also observed by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer. Given the previously observed anti-correlation between dust and tropical cyclone TC activity, the long-term variation of North Atlantic SST can then directly influence TC activity by changing a TC's maximum potential intensity and indirectly by modulating the transport of the dust-laden Saharan Air Layer. . In addition, an anti-correlation between long-term time series of tropical cyclone frequency and the retrieved dust amount from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer AVHRR over the Tropical Atlantic has been observed. Although the detailed mechanisms linking dust amount to TC activity are still unknown, there is considerable evidence showing the suppression of tropical cyclone development by the dry and dust-laden Saharan Air Layer.. Using both satellite and model data, , to study the long-term variation of Saharan dust amount over the Tropical Atlantic in 15°−60°W and 10°−20°N from 1979 to 2005. The region being studied is referred to as the “main development region” MDR , where the formation of TCs frequently occurs. The interannual variability of the MATCH monthly mean aerosol optical thickness AOT has been validated with a variety of observations. The variation of the monthly mean dust content has significant correlations with ground-based observations of dust concentrations over coastal sites around the Tropical Atlantic e.g., Barbados, Bermuda, and Miami and with available satellite observations e.g., monthly mean aerosol optical depths from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer and AVHRR in the Tropics. We analyze the interannual variability of the averaged AOT for August-September, when tropical cyclones most frequently occur over the tropical North Atlantic.; however, a warming trend since mid-1970s can also be clearly observed. To study the responses of atmospheric circulation and Saharan dust transport to trends in SST 1979–2005 , we look for trend signals in lower tropospheric temperatures and modeled dust amount by applying rotated principal component analysis PCA . The rotation is performed to those trend-bearing principal components PCs , which have non-zero linear trends at 2-. Therefore, we now investigate whether long-term temperature variation in the lower troposphere might be driving the decreasing dust trends in the MDR. Also shown in Figure 2b is the North Atlantic SST time series. The 850-hPa temperature PC shows a very similar variation to the SST, with a correlation of 0.97 99% confidence level for 1979–2005. This high correlation indicates that the 850-hPa temperature varies coherently with the North Atlantic SST. Figure 4 shows the corresponding spatial pattern of the SST trend in August-September for 1979–2005. The SST warming trends are basin-wide, while the temperature trends at 850 hPa exhibit a dipole pattern Figure 3a . It is not clear what mechanism causes this difference in spatial patterns between these two parameters. Further investigations are necessary to see if the altered transport direction of the warm SAL and the dust, which absorbs shortwave radiation, may play a role in modulating the temperature trends at 850 hPa.Linear trend in Kaplan North Atlantic SST K/decade in August-September for 1979–2005. The contour interval is 0.1, and the shaded area indicates the area with missing data. To illustrate how the dipole temperature trends can influence dust transport, we plot in Figure 3a the regression of the time series of NCEP winds at each grid point at 700 hPa on the corresponding 850-hPa temperature PC time series from Figure 2b . The wind anomalies can be approximately related to the temperature trends at 850 hPa through the thermal wind balance. The cyclonic anomaly, centered at 25°W and 20°N, near the coast of West Africa would tend to reduce the advection of Saharan dust into the tropical North Atlantic between 10°–20°N the MDR ., it is possible that the warmer SSTs both directly influence hurricane intensity by increasing the potential maximum wind speed and indirectly by altering the transport pathway of the dust-laden Saharan Air Layer.. A better understanding of such a system may be crucial for a complete understanding of how climate change will affect the intensity of tropical cyclones in the future.[18]  The change in dust distribution over the North Atlantic is also strongly correlated to lower tropospheric 850-hPa temperature trends over the African continent. Since the temperature over land is highly controlled by the land-surface model being used, there may be discrepancies and uncertainties among different models as to where the positive dust AOT trend is exactly located. Further investigation is necessary to study Saharan dust AOT trends outside the MDR."
151,aerosol ocean,"Mineralogy as a critical factor of dust iron solubility. To understand the impact of dust deposition on ocean primary productivity, the evaluation of dust input is not sufficient, and the soluble iron supply is also needed. Measurements of iron in aerosols suggest a much higher solubility than in soil, implying substantial atmospheric processing of chemical or physical nature. Here, we have investigated the effect of the mineralogy on iron solubility. We have measured iron solubility from some minerals commonly found in dust clay, feldspar and iron hydr- oxides . Firstly, we observe a greater solubility of iron resulting from clays similar to 4% in comparison to iron hydr- oxides <1% , independently of specific surface of minerals. Secondly, by considering amount of dissolved iron and the mineralogical composition of dust, our results indicate that dissolved iron fraction mainly comes from clay dissolution in contrast to that assumed in some biogeochemical models. In consequence, it appears that iron solubility is closely linked to the mineralogical composition of aerosol. . Indeed, solubility ranges from 0.01% to 80% and are highly heterogeneous in space and time. Although it is clear that atmospheric processing changes the solubility of iron as it moves from the source regions to be deposited into oceans, the relative importance of the different mechanisms is not clear. On one hand, several studies have emphasized that photochemical reactions, organic complexation and cloud processes in the atmosphere can modify iron solubility of desert dust. On the other hand, recent investigations, conducted by have measured the percentage of free-iron iron in hydr- oxide relative to the sample mass in dust aerosols: they found between 2.8 to 5% according to their origin and the free iron- to-the structural iron iron trapped in the crystal lattice of aluminosilicates ratio is often around 1.Relative mass content is given in %.Sites: 1, collected in Sal Island 9; 2, collected in Senegal Coast; 3, collected in Atlantic; 4, collected in Spain origin from Atlas ; 5, collected in Spain origin from Western Sahara ; 6, collected in Spain origin from Central Algeria .. Results of the analysis and origin of the minerals are given in Table 2 .From Ward’s natural science.From “ la galerie des minéraux ” of Paris.. After 60 min of contact time between acidified water and mineral particles with shaking, the solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm polycarbonate filter. Dissolved iron concentration DFe in the filtered sample was analyzed by GFAAS ATI-Unicam 929 . Multi-elementary analysis of the dissolved phase was made by ICP-AES PE Optima 3000 . All handling was performed in an ultra clean laboratory class < 1000 under ultra clean laminar flow benches class < 10 . The iron solubility %Fe S is calculated as follows: %Fe S = 100 × DFe/Fe tot where Fe tot is the total mineral concentration of iron. Preliminary studies, carried out in atmospheric conditions pH 4.7 and loading charge = 10 mg/L , showed that dissolved concentrations were close to the detection limit of the analytical methods when measuring the solubility of hydr- oxides. Knowing that low pH increases iron solubility, we adjust the pH of the aqueous phase to 2 to obtain enough iron to be above our detection limit. The particulate loading was fixed to 40mg/L. The ratio of the iron solubility between oxides and clays measured at pH 4.7 is approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than the ratio at pH 2. Thus, in this work, iron solubility in natural waters will be overestimated, and not necessarily in a linear fashion, meaning that the relationship between solubility at pH 4.7 and pH 2 is not linear. Thus, in this work, iron solubility could be overestimated for oxides. for aerosol samples collected over Pacific Ocean. These authors have suggested that iron chemical form in aerosol, i.e. i iron in aluminosilicate phase and ii iron in hydroxide phase, could be an explanation of this trend. Moreover, the low dissolution rate of hydrous oxides in comparison with aluminiosilicates is well known in aquatic surface geochemistry. Most of the dissolution reactions of minerals are critically dependent on the coordinative interactions taking place on surface. In consequence, the exponential trend of iron solubility could be linked to the type of chemical bonds in which iron atoms are implied in the mineral, Fe tot being a simple tracer of type of bonding. To investigate the role of the type of bond, dissolved iron concentrations have been compared to other dissolved elements X = Al, K or Mg . A ratio DX/DFe / Xtot/Fetot which is close to 1 shows that the Fe and X are dissolved according to a similar dissolution process, while a ratio < or > 1 emphasizes a preferential dissolution for Fe or X respectively. On this calculation basis, 4 types of dissolved iron behaviour can be distinguished Figure 1 and Table 3 :Percentage of soluble iron %Fe S as a function of total iron content of the mineral Fe tot in % .Dissolved fraction under detection limit of ICP-AES.Mean DFe = mean dissolved Fe amount.Usual mineral composition of African dust see Table 1 .Corrected DFe = mean DFe * mineral % in aerosol .Contribution of the mineral group to the total dissolved iron = %DFe = corrected DFe *100/ Σ corrected DFe ."
149,dust aerosol,"Photoenhanced uptake of NO2 on mineral dust: Laboratory experiments and model simulations. Mineral dust contains material such as TiO2 that is well known to have photocatalytic activity. In this laboratory study, mixed TiO2-SiO2, Saharan dust and Arizona Test Dust were exposed to NO2 in a coated wall flow tube reactor. While uptake in the dark was negligible, photoenhanced uptake of NO2 was observed on all samples. For the mixed TiO2-SiO2, the uptake coefficients increased with increasing TiO2 mass fraction, with BET uptake coefficients ranging from 0.12 to 1.9 x 10 -6 . HONO was observed from all samples, with varying yields, e. g., 80% for Saharan dust. Three-dimensional modeling indicates that photochemistry of dust may reduce the NO2 level up to 37% and ozone up to 5% during a dust event in the free troposphere. . Beside these major elements, some other oxides are found. The percentages of these other oxides, namely Fe 2 O 3 , MgO, CaO and TiO 2 , are slightly more variable and dependent on source location. For instance, titanium dioxide TiO 2 is found in dust particles at mass mixing ratios ranging from 0.1 to 10% depending on the exact location from where the particles were uplifted. It has been shown that the uptake of HNO 3 on dust has a significant effect on the global ozone budget.. Pure TiO 2 is used in a variety of remediation processes due to its photocatalytic properties. The resulting free-radicals are very efficient oxidizers of organic and inorganic matter. For instance, pure TiO 2 has been demonstrated to be an effective photocatalyst for NO 2 reduction. It has also been suggested that TiO 2 present in fly ash particles may represent a sink of halocarbons in the troposphere. However, the role of mineral dust aerosol as a photochemically active substrate that can modify the chemistry of the dust particles and their potential impact on the tropospheric composition has not been explored so far. Therefore, we investigated the effect of UV/visible light on the uptake kinetics of NO 2 on various mineral surfaces including SiO 2 /TiO 2 -based proxies and authentic dust particles. Another set-up was run at lower NO 2 concentrations and higher irradiance using real mineral samples i.e., Arizona test dust and grinded Saharan sand. In this case, the irradiations of mineral dust substrates were performed using a slightly different experimental layout i.e., in a 50 cm × 0.8 cm i.d. Duran glass tubes installed in an air cooled lamp housing holding 7 fluorescence lamps 44 cm × 2.6 cm o. d. , in a circular arrangement surrounding the thermostated reactor tube. These experiments were performed with UV lamps 300–420 nm, 13.4 mW cm −2 ... Some samples were also analyzed for anions by means of ion chromatography Dionex 120 equipped with an IonPac AS14A-4-mm column .. In the present study, solid TiO 2 diluted in SiO 2 at a mass mixing ratio of 1 wt% was used to mimic mineral dust at a relative humidity of 25%, consistent with those effectively reported for dust particles. For photoinduced processes, the uptake coefficients were normalized to the measured average irradiance I according to: In this case, the photochemical uptake coefficient Γ phot has units of mW cm −2 −1 . During these experiments, I was equal to 0.069 mW.cm −2 below 400 nm, i.e., in the wavelength range where TiO 2 can be photochemically activated. From Γ phot , it becomes possible to estimate, assuming a constant quantum yield below 400 nm, the order of magnitude of the uptake coefficient at different irradiance. These uptake coefficients were implemented in the LMDz-INCA chemistry-climate model to evaluate the environmental significance of the reaction. However, once the solid sample is irradiated a very rapid chemical conversion is observed. Figure 1 shows the raw data dark and light for an uptake experiment on a surface made of SiO 2 and TiO 2 /SiO 2 at 1 wt% of TiO 2 when the Pyrex flowtube was irradiated with the halogen lamps. It is obvious that under irradiation, the uptake of NO 2 is driven by a fast chemical reaction on the solid film. In this case, the uptake of NO 2 has been photo-enhanced by ca. two orders of magnitude. Not only is the uptake rate drastically accelerated but it also appears is to be catalytic in the sense that as shown in Figure 1 it does not depend on time, i.e., no surface saturation has been observed on these synthetic samples over hours even at NO 2 concentrations as large as 300 ppb . The measured uptake coefficients were observed to be strongly dependent on the NO 2 gas phase concentrations, in the range from 7 to 380 ppb, as shown in Figure 2 . This behavior can be explained via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism.The data shown correspond to the NO 2 gas phase concentration at the exit of the flowtube after being exposed for 0.96 s to solid surfaces of SiO 2 solid line in the dark and dash-dotted line, irradiated and a TiO 2 /SiO 2 dotted in the dark and dash-dot-dotted line, irradiated in the dark and irradiated by the four halogen lamps.Dependence of the uptake coefficient as a function of the NO 2 gas phase concentration. All experimental were conducted at 298 K, m dust = 25.3 mg, and 25% relative humidity. Each point was obtained from measurements on fresh samples. Nevertheless, we ensured that these photolytic chemical conversions also occur under even more realistic conditions. This was performed at very low NO 2 concentrations, under realistic irradiation using real mineral samples i.e., Arizona test dust and grinded Saharan sand. As shown in Figure 3 both samples do cause photochemical conversion of NO 2 once irradiated.Conversion of NO 2 into HONO on UV-A 300–420 nm irradiated mineral dust in presence of 24 ppb NO 2 and 24% relative humidity. a The formation of HONO solid circles, right axis and the removal of NO 2 open circles on a 32 mg deposited Saharan dust. b The formation of HONO solid circles, right axis and the removal of NO 2 open circles on a 56 mg deposited Arizona Test dust. The grey area at the top of the panels indicates the periods during which the film was exposed to NO 2 in the dark, the yellow area indicates the time when the film was irradiated.. On synthetic samples, we observed that the photochemical uptake coefficient γ BET increases from 0.12 to 1.9 × 10 −6 with increasing TiO 2 content from 1 to 5 wt%.: where the electrons, O 2 − and OH can react with nitrogen dioxide according to: It must be underlined that these reactions are just a subset of a large number of possible reactions altering the final yield of each product. Depending on the acidity of the surface, the production of nitrite anions is linked to that of gaseous nitrous acid HONO , known to be a very important source of hydroxyl radicals. Nitrous acid may accumulate during night-time before undergoing photolysis in the morning, but may also be produced during daytime with strong photochemical sources of 200–1800 pptv/h up to 60 times faster than all night-time sources. i.e., 75% on pure TiO 2 . This difference could be explained by different surface characteristics of the samples used. In addition, HONO was unambiguously detected under realistic conditions using Arizona test dust or grinded Saharan sand exposed to 24 ppb NO 2 see Figure 3 by means of the LOPAP instrument, which selectively detects HONO. For the grinded Saharan sand sample, O., the HONO yield is about 80%. For the Arizona test dust, the yield was lower and a delayed emission of HONO was observed, indicating that surface acidity, microstructure and other factors control the release of HONO in real dust samples, while the loss of NO 2 was remarkably similar. Photochemical HONO formation was observed for the first time on real surfaces and not only on synthetic TiO 2 samples. Nitrate anions were also observed to be solely produced during the photoconversion of NO 2 on dust.. For the simulations, a Γ phot value of 1.48 10 −5 mW cm −2 , determined for low NO 2 concentration on SiO 2 /TiO 2 surfaces, was considered. The simulated NO 2 concentrations decrease by 37% in the free troposphere in regions as the optical depth of the dust cloud averages 0.5 at 550 nm. Coincidently, nitric acid and OH decrease by 54.0 and 9.2% respectively, over the same region see Table 1 . The decreases in these photochemical species lead to a simulated O 3 concentration decrease of 5.1%.Percentage change in free tropospheric NO 2 concentration during a dust episode that occurred on July 30, 2002 over the Western Sahara, due to photochemically enhanced uptake on dust.[20]  When averaged over the globe, the decrease in simulated NO 2 concentrations in the free troposphere amounts to 3.0%. For nitric acid, OH and O 3 , the respective decrease averaged over the month of July are: 8.4, 1.7 and 1.4%.[21]  In this study, by using NO 2 as a probe molecule, we demonstrated unambiguously, under atmospheric relevant conditions, that photochemistry of dust is important. Consequently, this new chemical pathway needs to be considered in forthcoming modelling studies in order to better assess the impact of dust on the atmospheric composition. Indeed, we note that apart from NO 2 , which serves as electron acceptor, many other trace gas species or condensed constituents may be reduced or oxidized in a similar way on dust exposed to sunlight, potentially giving a wide impact of this photochemistry."
152,atmosphere,"Surface shortwave radiative forcing of different aerosol types in the central Mediterranean. Ground based measurements of aerosol optical depth, tau, and shortwave irradiance at the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa during 2003 and 2004 were used to estimate the surface aerosol shortwave radiative forcing. The shortwave forcing efficiency FE was derived at various solar zenith angles, theta, as the derivative of the shortwave irradiance with respect to tau. Values of FE for different classes of particles, namely desert dust, DD, biomass burning/industrial aerosols, BU, and for the whole dataset are derived. At the summer solstice the daily average FE is -86.4 W/m 2 for DD, -70.5 W/m 2 for BU, and -94.0 W/m 2 for the whole dataset. The daily aerosol forcing of DD is much larger than for the other aerosol classes due to the combination of larger forcing efficiency and largest optical depths. The estimated average daily forcing at the summer solstice and equinox for DD is -30 and -24 W/m 2 , respectively. . Large uncertainties still exist, due to the large spatial and temporal variations of aerosol properties. Different methods, based on measurements, models, and on the combined use of both, have been applied in the quantification of the aerosol forcing. In this study we use the method developed by and in irradiance see section 3.2 . A residual contamination from very thin clouds may still remain, and may affect cases of very low optical depth. These cases constitute a minor fraction of the used data. to derive the forcing efficiency FE, i.e. the radiative forcing produced by aerosols with an optical depth equal to 1. FE is calculated at fixed solar zenith angle as the derivative of F net θ with respect to. Model calculations of surface shortwave irradiance at θ = 20°, 40°, 60°, 75° for different values of wvc were performed. A 1.0 cm increase decrease in wvc around 2.5 cm produces a 2% decrease increase in irradiance. The variation is slightly larger at θ = 75°. Thus, the effect of the expected short-term wvc variability on the surface shortwave irradiance is smaller than ±2%. Due to the lack of continuous wvc observations during 2003 and 2004, wvc variations are taken into account by including an additional 2% random error on the measured irradiances. The possible presence of very thin clouds not detected by the cloud screening algorithm may affect the estimates of FE. As far as the cloud effect can be schematized as a constant offset in derived a daily forcing efficiency of −64 W/m 2 for aged biomass burning particles in the Aegean sea. derived estimates of daily FE for desert dust and polluted aerosols in Israel. They found values of −86 W/m 2 for dust and −81 W/m 2 for polluted particles in the Negev desert..[27]  Surface aerosol radiative forcing efficiencies were determined using measurements of shortwave fluxes and aerosol optical properties at Lampedusa in the period May–November of 2003 and 2004. The forcing efficiency was calculated separately for desert dust, for industrial/urban/biomass burning particles, and for the whole dataset, comprising different aerosol types. The aerosol FE was calculated as a function of the solar zenith angle, and estimates of the daily average forcing efficiency at the summer solstice and at the equinox were derived. The largest FE is found for the whole dataset, followed by desert dust and industrial/urban/biomass burning particles. Due to the characteristics of the size distribution, the dust optical depth is generally large throughout the shortwave spectral range, leading to large values of the DD forcing efficiency. Desert dust produces the largest forcing, due to the high value of both FE and τ in the central Mediterranean. The average forcing at the equinox is about −24 W/m 2 for DD, −13 W/m 2 for BU, and −17 W/m 2 for the whole dataset."
146,dust,"Aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity deduced from the last glacial maximum to Holocene transition. We use the temperature, carbon dioxide, methane, and dust concentration record from the Vostok ice core to deduce the aerosol radiative forcing during the Last Glacial Maximum LGM to Holocene transition and the climate sensitivity. A novel feature of our analysis is the use of a cooling period between about 42 KYBP thousand years before present and LGM to provide a constraint on the aerosol radiative forcing. We find the change in aerosol radiative forcing during the LGM to Holocene transition to be 3.3 +/- 0.8 W/m 2 and the climate sensitivity between 0.36 and 0.68 K/Wm -2 with a mean value of 0.49 +/- 0.07 K/ Wm -2 . This suggests a 95% likelihood of warming between 1.3 and 2.3 K due to doubling of atmospheric concentration of CO2. The ECHAM5 model simulation suggests that the aerosol optical depth during the LGM may have been almost twice the current value increase from 0.17 to 0.32 .  for doubling of CO 2 . Considering that the radiative forcing for the doubling of CO 2 is 3.7 ± 0.5 W/m 2 , the corresponding likely range of the IPCC suggested climate sensitivity is between 0.48 and 1.4 K/Wm −2 .. In these studies, the considered radiative forcing at the LGM to Holocene transition includes the solar output, radiative forcing due to the increase in greenhouse gases, radiative forcing due to changes in Earth's albedo including ice sheets extent and vegetation changes , and radiative forcing due to changes in atmospheric aerosol loading. Effects of aerosols on the hydrological cycle and on the radiative forcing still have large uncertainties. One of the uncertainties in the radiative forcing calculation during the LGM to the Holocene transition is the radiative forcing due to increased aerosol optical depth during the peak of the last ice age LGM . are shown in Figure 1 in units of 0.1 K . The maximum interglacial Holocene temperature is about 10.2 K above the LGM minimum temperature. A relatively warm epoch lasting over 600 years centered around the year 41710 YBP is about 4.8 K above the minimum LGM temperature. The polar region temperature changes are about twice as large as the global temperature; however, the exact ratio of the global to Vostok temperature change is not known. To account for this uncertainty, we consider three scenarios in which the global temperature difference between the Holocene and the LGM is taken to be 4.1, 4.6 and 5.1 K. This is in agreement with past investigations suggesting the global temperature difference between the Holocene and the LGM to be at most 5 K. The global temperature change between the warm maximum near 42 KYBP and the LGM is set to be 2.4 K half of the observed difference at the Vostok site and then the difference is decreased to 2.16 and 1.93 K, keeping the ratio of the temperature difference between the two considered climate transitions LGM to Holocene and the warm period 42 KYBP to LGM constant. where the change in the radiative forcing, ΔF CO2 , is in W/m 2 , and C 1 and C 2 are the CO 2 concentrations in ppmv before and after the considered climate transition. We obtain the radiative forcing due to CO 2 to be 2.40 W/m 2 for the LGM to Holocene transition and 0.74 W/m 2 for the transition between the LGM and the warm period 41710 YBP.. The change in radiative forcing due to the change in CH 4 concentration is estimated using the approximation where the change in the radiative forcing, ΔF CH4 , is in W/m 2 , and M 1 and M 2 are the CH 4 concentrations in ppbv before and after the considered transition. We obtain the radiative forcing due to CH 4 to be 0.27 W/m 2 for the LGM to Holocene transition and 0.19 W/m 2 for the warm period at 42 KYBP to LGM transition.. To account for a wide range of possible values we consider 11 different cases of the forcing with the values between 3 and 4 W/m 2 in increments of 0.1 W/m 2 . For the change of surface albedo between the LGM and the warm period 42 KYBP we consider a wide range of possibilities assuming that the radiative forcing due to surface albedo changes during this transition did not change at all, or changed in proportion to the albedo radiative forcing of the LGM to Holocene transition with the proportionality factor of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, or 0.30. Altogether we consider 77 possible combination of the forcing due to albedo changes. Multiplied by the three temperature differences for the LGM to Holocene transition, we consider a total of 231 different scenarios. We note Figure 1 that the decrease in aerosol concentration at the termination of the last glacial period started approximately at the same time as an increase in summer solar insolation at 65°N, which according to the Milankovitch hypothesis initiates the transition from the glacial to interglacial stage. It seems that the decrease in the dust atmospheric concentration had produced the first positive radiative forcing impulse that might have contributed to the termination of the glacial state. We find the aerosol radiative forcing during the LGM to Holocene transition to be 3.3 W/m 2 with a standard deviation of 0.8 W/m 2 . The climate sensitivity is thus limited to values between 0.36 and 0.68 K/Wm −2 with the mean value of 0.49 K/Wm −2 and standard deviation of 0.07 K/Wm −2 . Thus the LGM to Holocene transition suggests the climate sensitivity between 1.3 and 2.5 K with the mean value of 1.8 K for doubling of the atmospheric CO 2 .. Table 1 summarizes the appropriate dates and values of relevant parameters. We supplement these data with the deduced value of the radiative forcing per unit of aerosol concentration X = 0.056 W/m 2 and calculate the appropriate change in radiative forcing between the corresponding glacial to interglacial transitions. The mean values of climate sensitivities deduced from these glacial to interglacial transitions that occurred about 140 KYBP, 250 KYBP and 330 KYBP are 0.67, 0.60 and 0.60 K/Wm −2 , respectively, with a standard deviation of 0.07 K/Wm −2 corresponding to a temperature increase due to the doubling of CO 2 of 2.2 and 2.6 K, respectively, with an uncertainty of ±0.3 K . At this time it is not clear whether these higher sensitivities, compared to the climate sensitivity deduced from the LGM to Holocene transition, really reflect higher climate sensitivity at the time of the considered climate transitions or whether they are artifacts due to imperfect ice core data and uncertainties in the used approximations.The first column specifies an approximate time in YBP of the beginning of the interglacial period, ΔT is the corresponding temperature difference, CO 2 column gives the CO 2 concentration in ppmv before and after the transition, CH 4 provides similar data for CH 4 concentration in ppbv , and ΔDust indicates a change in relative dust units during the transition. The last column shows the climate sensitivity, λ , deduced from the considered glacial to interglacial transition. model to simulate aerosol radiative forcing and its geographical distribution. The simulations were carried out in T42 horizontal resolution ∼2.8° × 2.8° over 10 years. To simulate the high dust concentration in the ice core during the LGM, we have increased the strength of the current dust sources by a factor of 4, and the fluxes of DMS and sea salt both by a factor of 2, so that the average aerosol optical depth has almost doubled increased from 0.17 to 0.32 . The dust burden increased roughly by a factor of 3, which is comparable to the 2.5 higher dust loadings reported in the modeling study. The other aerosol sources and the greenhouse gas concentrations were held constant. The water vapor feedback causes the vertically integrated water vapor mass to be reduced by 0.15% during the LGM. The ECHAM5 model shows that the aerosols cause a strong regional radiative cooling especially over the oceans of up to 30 W/m 2 Figure 3 . The radiative forcing is dominated by the short-wave radiation that is responsible for the average radiative cooling of about 3.1 W/m 2 , while the long-wave radiation increased by 0.1 W/m 2 in the global mean. The total aerosol radiative forcing in the ECHAM5 simulation produces an aerosol cooling of 3.0 W/m 2 which is within the standard deviation of the radiative forcing derived in our analysis of the ice core data.ECHAM5 model simulation of the annual mean difference in dust aerosol depth and the radiative forcing between the LGM with enhanced aerosol concentration and the present-day., from observational data, and from a set of GCM simulations constrained by the ERBE Earth Radiation Budget Experiment observations. All these results together with our work presented in this paper support the lower end of the climate sensitivity range of 2 to 4.5 K suggested by the IPCC 2007 report."
144,aerosol,"Probable mixing state of aerosols in the Indo-Gangetic Basin, northern India. To investigate the probable mixing state of aerosols in the Indo-Gangetic Basin, six different mixing cases, viz. external mixing, internal mixing, and four combinations of core-shell type mixing black carbon, BC over dust, water-soluble over dust, BC over water-soluble and water-soluble over BC have been considered. Composite single scattering albedo SSA have been computed for six cases for post-monsoon, winter and pre-monsoon seasons and are compared with the Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET retrieved SSA values. The most probable mixing state in the post-monsoon season seems either to be external mixing or water-soluble coating over dust and in the winter season, the external mixing seems to be the probable mixing state. However, in the pre-monsoon season, BC coating over dust seems to be the most probable mixing state. This type of mixing leads to enhanced absorption and needs future attention to better understand the aerosol radiative effect in this region. . Aerosols can either be externally mixed different aerosol components existing separately or internally mixed each particle consists of different components . It has also been suggested that one component can form coating over another component to form core-shell type of mixing. and interact with the anthropogenic components as indicated by the presence of high concentration of Pb and Cd in the dust samples. In the other seasons, local soil-derived dusts contribute to the composite aerosol optical properties. Recently, the aerosol direct radiative effect over the IGB was estimated over several key locations from ground-based measurements for the winter season, where the authors assume external mixing. However, the aerosol mixing state in the IGB is still unknown. In this paper, we attempt to infer the most probable mixing state for the aerosols in the IGB for the first time based on the direct measurements of aerosol chemical composition.. We have considered absorbing black carbon BC , scattering water-soluble components and dust in fine and coarse mode as the main aerosol species in this region following the measurements made by . All together, we have chosen six possible mixing cases as shown in Figure 1a ; external case 1 , core-shell four combinations, case 2–5 and internal mixing case 6 . Dust is not considered as shell in core-shell type mixing, as it is unlikely. In the core-shell type mixing, the composite aerosol optical property is computed assuming the external mixture between the core-shell combination and the remaining component. BC and water-soluble are considered as shell and dust as core in case 2 and 4 respectively. Case 3 denotes water-soluble as shell and BC as core and case 5 represents the vice versa. a Various mixing cases considered for this study. Case 1 represents external mixing, Case 2 represents dust and BC as core-shell combination externally mixed with water-soluble, Case 3 represents BC and water-soluble as core-shell combination externally mixed with dust, Case 4 represents dust and water-soluble as core-shell combination externally mixed with BC, Case 5 represents water-soluble and BC as core-shell combination externally mixed with dust, and Case 6 represents internal mixing. b Mass fraction of the three major components BC, dust, and water-soluble in the post-monsoon, winter, and pre-monsoon seasons over Kanpur.. During these months, mass concentrations of water-soluble and dust were derived from the chemical analysis. Aerosol samples were collected on Whatmann GF/A filter papers of size 8″ * 10″ using APM 450 Envirotech High-volume PM 10 sampler, operated at a flow rate of 0.7–1.1 m 3 min −1 and the concentrations of water-soluble components are derived. Mass of the soil-derived dust was reconstructed using ‘Al' to be 8% of the soil mass. BC concentration was measured by Aethalometer Magee Scientific, USA . The mass concentration of dust is highest in March 22.68. Keeping this fact in mind, we have considered dust layer between 2 to 3 km in our sensitivity study, while considering the vertical profiles of BC and water-soluble components constant above 1.5 km altitude. There are not enough BC particles available to coat dust particles aloft, but there is possibility that the elevated dust particles get coated by BC on the path of transportation. In that case, the presence of the dust layer would reduce the columnar SSA below 0.7. The internal mixing results in 7% lower SSA at 0.44. The mixing of BC with dust would increase the absorption efficiency of dust particles in this region. [2007] have observed large dust absorption over Indian region and commented that this could be due to mixing of BC on dust particles, which is substantiated by our results. The core-shell mixing of dust and BC in the pre-monsoon season has important climatic implications, as the radiative impact due to dust would lead to heating rather than cooling. Our results further indicate the importance of investigation of BC-dust mixing in quantitative way in future.[16]  The various mixing scenarios of aerosols in the IGB have been investigated using the measured chemical composition at surface carried out in Kanpur in three distinct seasons and are compared with the AERONET-retrieved columnar SSA using the measured aerosol vertical profiles up to 1.5 km. With the limitations of aerosol vertical profiles, the major conclusions of our study are as follows:[17]   1 The external mixing is the most probable mixing state in the winter, whereas the water-soluble coating over dust particles and external mixing emerge as the probable cases in the post-monsoon season. However, very close SSA values for the above cases imply that the external mixing would be reasonable choice to compute aerosol radiative effects in these seasons.[18]   2 The mixing state is, however, very different in the pre-monsoon season, when the BC coating over dust particles seems to be the most probable case. The other mixing cases result in higher scattering as compared to AERONET. The dust-BC mixing in the IGB would lead to enhanced absorption and further in situ observations, especially the distribution of dusts aloft are needed to address this issue more quantitatively."
154,impact aerosol,"Cooling of the Atlantic by Saharan dust. Using aerosol optical depth, sea surface temperature, top-of-the-atmosphere solar radiation flux, and oceanic mixed-layer depth from diverse data sources that include NASA satellites, NCEP reanalysis, in situ observations, as well as long-term dust records from Barbados, we examine the possible relationships between Saharan dust and Atlantic sea surface temperature. Results show that the estimated anomalous cooling pattern of the Atlantic during June 2006 relative to June 2005 due to attenuation of surface solar radiation by Saharan dust remarkably resemble observations, accounting for approximately 30-40% of the observed change in sea surface temperature. Historical data analysis show that there is a robust negative correlation between atmospheric dust loading and Atlantic SST consistent with the notion that increased decreased Saharan dust is associated with cooling warming of the Atlantic during the early hurricane season July-August September . . During the peak season of June through August, airborne dust particles reach the western Atlantic and Caribbean, and can be detected as far west as Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico. Saharan dusts have been shown to affect the development of clouds and precipitation over oceanic areas across the Atlantic, as well as modulating thunderstorm activities over the Caribbean, and the southeast US. Hot dry air, known as the Saharan Air Layer SAL , which often accompanies Saharan dust outbreaks, can suppress tropical cyclogenesis and inhibit Atlantic hurricane formation. Studies have also found significant positive correlation between dust cover and Atlantic tropical cyclone days., issues were raised regarding the magnitude of the difference in atmospheric dust loading, and the degree to which solar attenuation effect by dust could lower Atlantic SST. In this paper, we present observation-based estimates of possible large-scale cooling of the Atlantic by Saharan dust attenuation effect for 2006 relative to 2005, and examine statistical dust-SST relationships based on long-term historical records. for absorbing aerosols dust and black carbon from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument OMI , aerosol optical depth AOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS , daily sea surface temperature from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager TMI , top-of-the atmosphere solar radiation from the National Center for Environmental Prediction NCEP reanalysis data, and climatological oceanic mixed layer depth from the Laboratoire d'Océanographie et du Climat: Expérimentation et Approches Numériques LOCEAN . Also used for the historical data analysis are long-term data from the Barbados dust record, and the SST record from the Hadley Center. To illustrate the possible solar attenuation effect on SST by dust, and to minimize the interactive effects between dust and atmospheric-ocean dynamical processes, we focus on the early part of the season when hurricanes are few and dust events are frequent, so that SST pre-conditioning effects by dust can be more readily untangled from dynamical processes. During June 2006, excessive dust loading relative to 2005 is found over the entire Atlantic from 5°N–25°N, as evident in the distribution of MODIS AOD, with maximum >0.2 in the main propagation path of Saharan dust along 5°N–20°N Figure 2a . The observed SST pattern Figure 2b shows widespread cooling of the Atlantic coinciding with the positive AOD anomaly, with pronounced signals of 0.5–0.8 °C in the Caribbean, the eastern Atlantic and regions off the coast of North Africa.Spatial pattern of a MODIS AOD difference, defined as the monthly mean difference between June 2006 and June 2005, with positive anomalies shaded; b observed SST °C difference from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Instrument with negative anomalies shaded; c climatological OML depth m with values less than 35m shaded; and d estimated SST difference due to solar attenuation by dust °C , with negative contours shaded.. Here, it is clear that the OML is relatively deep >40 m in the central tropical Atlantic 40–50°W , but shallow <25m in the subtropical Atlantic, Caribbean, and regions off the coasts of North Africa and northern South America Figure 2c . For a given change in surface solar radiation, the SST in the shallower region is more sensitive, because the energy is distributed over a smaller volume of water. To estimate the shortwave radiation at the ocean surface, we scale the shortwave flux at the top of the atmosphere from NCEP by the daily MODIS AOD with an attenuation factor e − A ° D following the procedure used by Schollaert and Merrill , possibly because of the neglect of longwave fluxes as well as cloud effects. The surface shortwave flux is then applied to a slab OML model with climatological mixed layer depths, and integrated with initial condition from May 31 to obtain the cumulative SST change due to solar attenuation for June 2005 and 2006 respectively for the North Atlantic. has shown that for Saharan dust, the longwave heating is of the order of 20–30% of the shortwave cooling. Reducing the solar attenuation by that percentage yields a crude net dust radiative forcing contribution of approximately 30–40% to the observed SST cooling between June 2006 and 2005. Such a contribution clearly cannot be ignored., which is the only multi-decadal continuous in-situ dust data available. The data have been tested, and shown to be representative of dust loadings over large areas of the North Atlantic region. We have also computed correlation patterns of Barbados dust with TOMS AI, and MODIS AOD, showing large spatial coherence of the Barbados dust signal figures omitted . The one-point correlation map between Barbados dust record and Hadley Center SST for July–August–September JAS has been computed for the period 1980–1999 for the domain 20°S–40°N, 100°W–20°E Figure 3a . The larger domain is chosen to provide the large-scale context for the correlations, and to compare with similar one-point correlation map with the Niño3 SST anomalies Figure 3b .One-point correlation map of SST with a Barbados dust index, and b Niño3 SST. Light dark shading marks regions with correlation exceeding the 90% 95% .. Over the western Atlantic 40°–60°W , where hurricanes making landfall on US east and southeast coasts tend to spawn and intensify, the SST signal associated with El Niño is a slight warming effect. The 2006–2005 observed JAS SST anomaly in the Atlantic bears some resemblance to the dust-SST correlation pattern Figure 3a , but is distinctly different from the El Niño–SST pattern Figure 3b . If the above results can be applied to the 2005–2006 seasons, they would further support the notion that radiative effect of Saharan dust may play an important role in the cooling of the Atlantic in 2006 relative to 2005.[11]  Based on estimates of SST cooling due to solar attenuation by Saharan dust, and analyses of correlations from historical data, we have provided preliminary evidences supporting the notion that solar attenuation effects due to increased decreased Saharan dust loading over the Atlantic may contribute to widespread cooling warming of the underlying sea surface in the early hurricane season. Our results are consistent with the idea that anomalous dust loading over the West Atlantic Caribbean region may have been instrumental in initiating the large-scale SST cooling in the Atlantic in June 2006. Since dust loading in the West Atlantic and Caribbean typically peaks in the early hurricane season June–August , such pre-conditioning may have predictive value in terms of SST effects, in fine-tuning seasonal hurricane forecasts.[12]  Finally, the estimate of SST cooling from solar attenuation by dust in this study represents a very crude approximation only. More detailed computations of dust radiative fluxes require knowledge of the ambient atmospheric temperature and moisture soundings, size distribution, radiative properties and vertical profiles of dust. These calculations need to be carried out for more years and different months in future studies to establish statistical rigor in our result. The radiative fluxes should also be examined in the context of the total surface heat fluxes including those due to wind-evaporation and oceanic processes, in order to obtain better quantitative estimates of the relative roles of radiative effects of Saharan dust on Atlantic SST."
156,dust,"Anti-Atlas Moroccan Chain as the source of lithogenic-derived micronutrient fluxes to the deep Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Identifying the source of atmospheric dust is crucial to better understand the global marine biogeochemical cycle as phytoplankton growth relies on dissolved micronutrient elements available in the open ocean. Mineralogical, geochemical and Sr isotope analyses of a one year- time series April 2003 - April 2004 of deep ocean particle flux at the Madeira Abyssal Plain in the subtropical northeast Atlantic are presented. The lithogenic fraction has a high occurrence of palygorskite and smectite and an absence of kaolinite together with Sr isotopic compositions similar to the Northeast Atlantic aerosols. This indicates the Anti-Atlas Moroccan chain of Paleozoic age as the source region. The lithogenic fraction supplies 4 times more Fe during a dust event than during the spring- summer aeolian input. A continuous input of only 1% of the lithogenic iron made available over a year period, could lead to an increase in primary productivity of 40% relative to today's value. . Fe is mostly supplied to the ocean via river inputs, continental margin sediments, and aeolian deposition. Sahara dust storms represent a period of Fe loading to the proximal coastal surface ocean and in the subtropical ocean culminate in a phytoplankton bloom during the fall-winter period. Previous meteorological studies showed that all North Africa is a potential dust source. The total ozone mapping spectrometer TOMS can identify major dust sources within Africa, however the deposition area of dust originating from these sources to the open ocean remains a subject of debate. So far, element fluxes associated with lithogenic input are determined by difference between total fluxes and those from the biogenic components, relying on a sole continental origin of Aluminium Al . However, such an assumption may lead to systematic errors in dust/Al ratios. We presents the results of a mineralogical, chemical and Sr isotopic investigation of a one year time-series of particle flux in the subtropical northeast Atlantic in order to better understand and constrain the impact of aeolian-derived micronutrients on the biogeochemistry..Position of the Kiel276 site and its main mineralogical, geochemical, and Sr isotope compositions. Map based on and North African aerosols pale blue field . In subtropical Atlantic nitrogen fixation fuel up to 50% of export production, and is itself limited by either P or Fe. Therefore additional iron supply to this region may relief the limitation, and enhance the primary production. Fe and P are especially known for their potential to act as limiting factors for phytoplankton growth. Within the lithogenic fraction from April 2003 to April 2004 between 1.5 and 15 μ mol m −2 d −1 of particulate Fe and up to 0.5 μ mol m −2 d −1 of particulate P were delivered to the region Data Set S4 of the auxiliary material ; Figure 4 . If we assume that 2% of the particulate Fe is soluble upon entering the water column, then 0.08 μ mol m −2 d −1 and 0.005 μ mol m −2 d −1 of average dissolved Fe and P, respectively, are delivered to the ocean. Those Fe and P fluxes increase drastically during dust events in spring 2004 15 μ mol m −2 d −1 of particulate Fe and 0.2 μ mol m −2 d −1 of particulate P, respectively , and consequently 4 times more dissolved Fe 0.3 μ mol m −2 d −1 is supplied to the region over only a short time period Figure 4 . Note however, that Fe bio-availability is still poorly understood whereby oxidation of organically complexed Fe II plays a crucial role on Fe uptake by micro-organisms. We assume that 1 only 1% of the dissolved iron is made bio-available, 2 that particulate Fe is unavailable to phytoplankton, and 3 that the uptake and in-situ remineralisation rates of Fe over 30 days are much smaller in comparison to the external inputs. Using a Redfield Ratio of C/Fe = 122/2.6 × 10 −5 we obtain an additional carbon production of 0.17 g C m −2 d −1 , which itself is rather unspectacular. Climate change scenarios proceed from the assumption that the number and duration of the dust storm events will drastically increase due to progression of arid areas and the fast growth of deserts, especially within the African continent, leading to an increase in the bio-available Fe pool. Continuous input of just 0.3 μ mol m −2 d −1 of bio-available Fe over a year period, would potentially lead to an additional production of 62 g C m −2 y −1 assuming a direct effect on primary productivity, resulting in an annual production of 210 g C m −2 y −1 40% increase compare with today's values for this region . However, additional Fe input enhances, first, N 2 -fixation. This N is then used for primary production, reducing the overall increase in primary productivity because the Fe requirements for nitrogen fixation are high compare to primary production. Therefore the 40% rise in primary production estimated in this study most likely represents the upper limit of the effect of Fe input into the subtropical Atlantic.Lithogenic derived element fluxes between April 2003 and April 2004 at 3050 m depth."
172,climate aerosol,"Atmospheric warming due to dust absorption over Afro-Asian regions. There have been several investigations to understand the impact of Saharan dust layer on radiative heat balance. However, there are few studies on the impact of dust over Asian regions which is unique in aerosol perspective because of co-existence of natural and anthropogenic aerosols. Here, we examine the surface cooling and lower atmospheric warming and hence heating rate due to dust over Afro-Asian regions using collocated data from METEOSAT of ESA and MODIS of NASA . Large reduction of surface reaching solar radiation as much as 10 to 15 W m -2 due to dust was observed simultaneous with a lower atmospheric warming of 0.3 to 0.5 K/day. During local noon warming was as large as 3K over desert regions. The large dust heating at source regions and its impact over ocean due to transported dust raises several issues which need to be understood. . Ultra fine sand particles are formed by winds mostly in the arid regions of the world. The long-range transport of continental derived particles by the combined action of convection currents and general circulation make these particles a significant constituent even at locations far from their sources. For e.g., several investigations over the Atlantic Ocean have observed Saharan dust even at remote locations of the Atlantic Ocean. Soil derived particles are among the largest aerosols with radii ranging from below 0.1. left Depression of IR emission at the surface due to a decreased downward SW flux. right Depression in OLR due to dust absorption. T s is surface temperature, T dl is temperature of the dust layer, ɛ is emissivity of surface, R b is the radiation emitted from Earth's surface assuming Earth as a black body , and R t is the radiation at the TOA.. The radiance depression at the top of the atmosphere TOA i.e., IDDI due to the presence of dust layer is, where R t ↑ is the radiance leaving the TOA satellite measured and R b ↑ is the radiance leaving the TOA without dust.. The next step is to create ‘reference image’ representing clear-sky conditions for consecutive, non-overlapping periods whose duration is short enough to eliminate the seasonal effects but long enough to ensure that the clear-sky or near clear-sky conditions exists at least one measurement for each pixel. The purpose of ‘reference image’ is to separate the land effect from ‘original image’. A 15-day reference period is used here. This operation for a pixel i, j and according to the day number k is given by, Superscript r means the reference value of k associated with the highest value of P k ij . For a given pixel, the maximum in the daily values of IRBT within a given reference period is assumed to represent the characteristics of the target pixel as in cloud-free and dust free background condition. The reference brightness temperatures usually are in the range from 300 to 320 K. Next, a ‘difference image’ exhibiting the clouds and dust patterns separated from the permanent surface features, was obtained by subtracting individual day ‘original image’ or IRBT from ‘reference image’ for that period. The ‘difference image’ shows only the variable atmospheric radiative effects related to both clouds and dust. Difference values represent the reduction in IRBT due to dust aerosols, provided cloudy pixels are identified and screened.. More details on data analysis including construction of IDDI images and cloud screening are available in literature. The IDDI images were created from IRBT images to study the regional characteristics of dust. have demonstrated that using images of IDDI and aerosol optical depth τ a , we can construct images of Dust Absorbing Efficiency D AE defined as, . In this study, we have used simultaneous METEOSAT infrared radiance and MODIS aerosol optical depth at 0.55 μ m data to study the absorption characteristics of dust over Afro-Asian regions. Here, we have used dust optical properties deduced from D AE images and are incorporated in a Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer RT model developed by University of Santa Barbara SBDART to estimate the dust aerosol impact forcing . The deduced single scattering albedo of dust was in the range of 0.89 to 0.96. Using these data on dust optical properties, we have modeled IDDI as a function of dust optical depth. We have then used the simulated using SBDART relation between IDDI and optical depth to estimate dust optical depth from IDDI. The dust optical depth estimated from IDDI and optical properties inferred from D AE images were incorporated in radiative transfer model SBDART and estimated dust radiative forcing covering both visible and infrared wavelengths . The surface reflection was obtained from MODIS Albedo Product MODIS/Terra Albedo; 16-Day; Level-3 Global 1 km Grid . The atmospheric heating rate due to atmospheric forcing component ΔF of dust is given by, where is the heating rate K day −1 , g is the acceleration due to gravity, C p the specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure ∼1006 J kg −1 K −1 , and P is the atmospheric pressure, respectively. Atmospheric forcing component ΔF is estimated by subtracting the surface forcing from that at the top of the atmosphere. Regional distribution of dust heating rate estimated from ΔF following equation 6 is shown in Figure 2 right , which shows that dust absorption leads to atmospheric heating rates as much as 0.3 to 0.5 K/day. The monthly average dust heating rates K/day at three representative source regions Saudi Arabia, Rajasthan northwest India , and Somalia are shown in Figure 3 . It may be noted that these values are estimated from diurnally averaged dust absorption. When we estimated dust absorption at local noon, then it translated to an atmospheric warming as large as 3 K. In Figure 4 , we show a typical example of temperature profile obtained from India Meteorological Department IMD radio sonde data for June 2003. The surface cooling and lower atmosphere heating estimated in this study for that region is also shown in Figure 4 . It was observed that a dust layer can force a surface–lower atmosphere temperature contrast ΔT of as much as ∼7°C during local noon. From the temperature profile it is obvious that this contrast is not sufficient to generate a temperature inversion. However, during late evening or night when surface cools due to radiative emission, the temperature contrasts due to dust can lead to a temperature inversion. The aerosol-induced surface-lower atmosphere temperature contrast ΔT values estimated for three source regions are given in Table 1 .Monthly average dust heating rates K/day at three representative source regions.A typical example of temperature profile at Rajasthan desert for June 2003. The surface cooling and atmospheric heating due to dust is also shown. Arrow toward right represents an increase in temperature due to dust absorption and arrow toward left represents cooling.. Our studies have shown that typically, dust doubles the short-wave radiation absorption under clear-sky conditions. The large cooling of Earth's surface simultaneous with warming of the lower atmosphere might enhance the process of fog formation especially in the morning hours. The role of aerosol radiative impact on fog formation is an issue not addressed yet. Inclusion of aerosol radiative forcing in fog prediction model might enhance the accuracy of prediction substantially. The reduction of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface as a result of scattering and absorption by dust aerosols reduces the sensible heat flux. Thus the presence of dust transported over oceans from source regions over land intensifies a low-level inversion, which in turn affects the stability of the atmosphere. This may have a consequent impact on regional climate system. The large cooling of ocean surface simultaneous with warming of the lower atmosphere may have an impact on sea-surface temperature and hence convection over ocean. The consequent effect on cloud formation is not understood well. The large dust heating at source regions and its impact over ocean due to transported dust raises several issues which need to be understood.[14]  1. Large reduction of surface reaching solar radiation as much as 10 to 15 W m −2 or 1.7 K due to dust was observed simultaneous with a lower atmospheric warming of 0.3 to 0.5 K/day.[15]  2. During local noon warming was as much as 3 K and corresponding surface cooling was 5.2 K.[16]  3. The large cooling of Earth's surface simultaneous with warming of the lower atmosphere might enhance the process of fog formation especially in the morning hours.[17]  4. The large dust heating at source regions and its impact over ocean due to transported dust raises several issues which need to be understood."
173,ocean,"Micro pulse lidar observation of high altitude aerosol layers at Visakhapatnam located on the east coast of India. [1] Aerosol back scatter profiles obtained using a micro pulse lidar at Visakhapatnam, a station located on the east coast of peninsular India show certain high altitude aerosol layers during the months of March/April 2005, 2006. Co-located aerosol optical depth measurements show an increase in AOD by 0.05 to 0.25 during the event when the layers were observed. The prevailing meteorology does not indicate any possible local entrainment of aerosol leading to the formation of elevated layers due to boundary layer dynamics. The 7 day back trajectory analysis shows that the possible origin of the layers could be from Arabia in 60% of the cases while it is from Indian sub-continent during the rest of the events. When the air mass flow is from the Indian sub-continent, there is a proportional increase in MODIS derived aerosol column fine mode fraction though it is not observed at the surface level. During the events when air mass flow is from Arabia, such an increase in column fine mode fraction was not observed but the angstrom size index which is a measure of the aerosol size distribution was low indicating that the elevated layers of Arabian origin could contain significant fraction of dust aerosol. . Current emphasis is on the observation of physical properties of the atmospheric boundary layer aerosols and elevated aerosol layers which are most relevant to radiative forcing applications. Lidar measurements are valuable in aerosol studies in that they potentially supply vertical information on aerosol optical properties. Lidar profiles sampling the air mass advected from the Indian sub-continent show multiple layers present over the Indian ocean as a result of convection and long range transport of aerosol originating from arid and semi arid regions of the world. At times the air mass shows 3 km deep pollution layer above the boundary layer. Such elevated aerosol plumes were also observed over the northern India, particularly during winter season due to dry convective lifting of pollutants at distant sources and subsequent horizontal upper air long range transport. Aerosol layers found above the boundary layer could be transported several thousands of km without significant removal and can contribute significantly to the column aerosol optical depth, at times more than the boundary layer. From aerosol assimilation model, for evaluating the overlap correction factors for the MPL back scatter intensity. The overlap occurred at an altitude of 1.8 km for the present transceiver. The micro pulse lidar used in the present study transmits pulse energy of 6–7   in some cases does indicate an enhancement. The MODIS derived fine mode fraction is a product from spectral optical depth AOD and hence corresponds to columnar measurements while the QCM measurements reported here reflect the near surface features. In order to assess the probable source regions of the elevated layers, we have investigated the 7 day back trajectories for all the cases of elevated layers at the mean height of the layer with Visakhapatnam as the source point. The results which are consolidated in Table 1 indicate that in 60% of the cases the layer origin seems to be from Arabia as the back trajectory calculations indicated that at the layer altitudes the air masses advected from Arabian regions, while in the rest of the cases it could be either from Indian sub-continent or from the Bay of Bengal as shown in Figure 5 . But, whenever there is an indication of transport from Arabia, the air mass travels over the Indian sub-continent also before being observed at the site. Therefore, it is difficult to identify whether the layer constitutes of dust aerosol if it is coming from Arabia as in its transit it could also pick up the anthropogenic aerosol over the continent. In certain cases mixing of dust particles with boundary layer aerosols reduces dust signatures and makes it difficult for the separation of the dust particles from those of mostly urban origin. The frequent co-existence of urban, continental, dust and marine aerosol makes it difficult to provide distinct information on the optical properties of individual types of aerosol using lidar measurements. This has prompted us to investigate whether the elevated layer consists of a dominant fine mode aerosol or the dust aerosol. The AOD data at five wavelengths namely 380, 440, 500, 675, and 870 nm measured using the Microtops sun photometer are analyzed by fitting the Angstrom power law which is of the form Aerosol back scatter vertical profiles measured using a micro pulse lidar at Visakhapatnam located on the east coast of India show high altitude aerosol layers above the boundary layer in the height region between 1.6 to 5 km during the summer months of March – April 2005, 2006. Co- located column optical depth measurements indicate an increased AOD at 500 nm by 0.05 to 0.25 during the presence of such layers, while the surface aerosol mass concentrations measured during the presence of the layers do not show a proportionate increase. The extinction coefficients derived from MPL back scatter profiles match with column AOD observations using a Microtops sunphotometer. The 7 day back trajectories analysis at the level of the layers indicate that the air mass origin forming the layers is from Arabia during 60% of the case while in the rest it is either from the Indian sub-continent or from Bay of Bengal. In the presence of layers with air mass origin from Arabia the aerosol size index α derived from spectral AODs was lower in the range 1.05 to 1.3 while in other cases with air mass origin from the Indian sub-continent, the size index was more than 1.4. This feature when viewed with the observation that the surface aerosol mass concentration did not show proportionate increase suggests that during the events of layer with air mass origin from Arabia, the column aerosol could comprise of a significant fraction of dust aerosol in the layer."
174,dust aerosol clouds,"Diurnal cycle of dust and cirrus over West Africa as seen from Meteosat Second Generation satellite and a regional forecast model. A brightness temperature difference BTD technique is used to evaluate the dust and cirrus forecasts of a regional meteorological model. The technique based on a contrasted absorption property of dust and cirrus at two wavelengths within the atmospheric infrared window is applied to 3-hourly Meteosat Second Generation MSG observations in the 10.8- and 12-mu m bands over West Africa. The satellite observation of dust coverage over the Sahara shows a well marked diurnal cycle associated with the boundary layer activity peaking at 15 UTC. A similar signature is obtained from the regional model when the dust scheme is activated. The cirrus cover over West Africa is maximum at 12 UTC as seen both from MSG and the model. The use of prognostic dust aerosol, instead of climatology, furthermore better captures the observed convective activity. . To a large extent, dust and cirrus are products of surface and planetary boundary layer PBL , and convective processes, respectively. Dominant dust sources in North Africa are natural dry topographic depressions while half of the tropical cirrus are originated from deep convection. Both dust and cirrus can be advected over large distances away from their sources. Thus their modeling requires prognostic equations with a subgrid-scale source and a transport term. This combination makes their representation difficult.. Over North Africa, diurnal variability in dust mobilization can vary from 55 to 75% depending on model configurations. Over Brazil, the correct diurnal cycle of upper-tropospheric humidity is obtained after tuning a critical parameter in a cirrus parameterization constrained by MSG observations. The later study adopted a model-to-satellite approach, in which satellite brightness temperature BT images are directly compared to BTs computed from predicted model fields. This approach is especially powerful in identifying discrepancies of cloud cover forecasts. The present paper shows how a split-window technique associated with the model-to-satellite approach can give an assessment of the dust and cirrus cover forecasts.. The technique is based on a contrasted absorption property of ice crystals at two channels located within the atmospheric infrared window. More specifically, positive brightness temperature difference BTD between the 10.8- and 12-. The dust scheme consists of the Dust Entrainment and Deposition DEAD model that calculates dust fluxes from wind friction coupled with the ORILAM model that follows the evolution of two moments of three modes fine, accumulation, coarse of lognormal aerosol distribution. The distribution parameters are taken from the Saharan aerosol study of . The surface emissivity is given by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS MYD11C3 product. Hexagonal columns are assumed with radiative properties taken from and with an effective dimension diagnosed from the ice water content. RTTOV has been adapted to take into account the aerosol extinction effect using the mineral transported model from the OPAC database. As for clouds, we assume dust to be grey bodies. shows the presence of aerosol over Mauritania and northern Mali. The areas with the largest AI values well match those with negative BTDs observed from MSG Figure 1b . Here, the negative BTD is due to the larger absorption by dust at 10.8 μ m than at 12 μ m. The dust signal is reproduced for the DUST simulation only Figure 1d . Note that the negative BTD area does not match the region with predicted aerosol optical depth AOD larger than 0.5 as the dust effect on BTD depends on its altitude. The BTD signal can be also masked by the presence of cirrus cloud as revealed by observed BTD larger than 2 K. Such a signal is well reproduced by both the CTRL and DUST simulations, confirming a good capacity of the model to forecast the cirrus cover. a OMI aerosol index and BTD K between 10.8 and 12 μ m bands at 12 UTC 26 August 2005 obtained from b the MSG observations, c the CTRL and d DUST simulations. Black contours in Figure 1d are dust AOD larger than 0.25..Time evolution of the BTD K distribution obtained from a the observations, and the 27–48 h forecasts of the b CTRL and c DUST simulations. The time axis is indicated by the day; a, August; s, September. The diurnal BTD variation due to the dust is further investigated by looking at the bi-diurnal cycle in the vertical section Figure 4 obtained from the DUST simulations in a west Saharian area 15°W–0°, 20°–25°N shown in Figure 1d . The variation of dust concentration with height follows the diurnal cycle of the convective PBL. A peak in dust is achieved at 18 UTC when the virtual potential temperature θ v is almost constant between the ground and 4-km altitude. During night the nocturnal jet contributes to the dust mobilization that concentrates dust close to the surface while atmospheric dust particles can sediment with the collapse of the PBL. Next morning, the dust produced during nighttime is then entrained in the troposphere as soon as the solar heating develops a diurnal-mixed PBL. Note also the lowering of atmospheric water vapor during the night, a feature enhancing the dust detection. Such a diurnal cycle has also been reported from visibility observations and from different models using different dust source schemes.DUST evolution of the dust concentration μ g m −3 , shading , water vapor mixing ratio thick dotted at 4 and 5 g kg −1 , , θ v dashed, every 2 K , and wind speed white contour at 4 and 6 m s −1 , .

The maximum wind speed is 17 m s −1 .[14]  A BTD technique is applied to MSG observations between the 10.8- and 12- μ m bands in order to monitor the dust and cirrus cover during the AMMA dry run. When it is combined with the model-to-satellite approach, the BTD technique gives a specific constraint to the dust distribution. In particular, it highlights the diurnal cycle of dust over the Sahara. It also confirms the good capacity of the model to forecast cirrus cover at regional scales. Moreover, the model result shows a positive impact on the simulated intensity of tropical deep convection and the associated wind fields, in particular the AEJ.[15]  The present technique is used to evaluate the cirrus and dust forecast of the model. One has to consider the combination of both cirrus and dust, thus their radiative properties, in order to utilize the BTD technique in its full potential. A combination of passive IR remote sensing technique and the space lidar CALIPSO has a high potential to provide an additional constraint on dust and cirrus modeling. Furthermore, the measurements taken during the AMMA experiment should help in documenting the mass distribution of dust. In near future, the next generation of operational models will operate with explicit bulk cloud schemes to be run at mesoscale with typical grid size of a few kilometers. A systematic evaluation with MSG observations, up to every 15 minutes, by the present approach would lead to substantial progress in dust and cirrus modeling. Finally, this approach also offers guidance to climate models for evaluating important model components such as the cirrus and dust schemes and their respective climate radiative impact."
175,climate,"Satellite-based assessment of cloud-free net radiative effect of dust aerosols over the Atlantic Ocean. [1] Using eighteen months June-August, 2000-2005 of spatially and temporally collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System CERES data from the Terra satellite over the Atlantic Ocean [10W-60W, 0-30N], we first separate the dust aerosol optical thickness at 0.55 mu m AOT from the total column MODIS AOT. We then calculate the cloud-free TOA net radiative effect NRE of dust aerosols by accounting for diurnal effects and sample biases. The cloud-free NRE is -6.31 +/- 1.16 Wm -2 and nearly twenty percent of the shortwave radiative effect -7.75 +/- 0.86 Wm -2 is cancelled by the longwave radiative effect +1.44 +/- 0.57 Wm -2 indicating the importance of the dust aerosols in the thermal portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is the first multi-year satellite-based assessment of the NRE of dust aerosols indicating the importance of both the shortwave and longwave radiative effects of dust aerosols over the oceans unlike anthropogenic aerosols that have negligible TOA longwave radiative forcing effects. . They are effective in scattering and absorbing incoming solar radiation and have significant effects in the longwave portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum since they have large particle sizes and emit at a colder temperature when compared to clear sky regions. Desert dust is considered to originate mainly from natural sources although large uncertainties exist in determining the contribution of land use or anthropogenic sources to dust loading.. The Net Radiative Effect NRE is the sum of the SWRE and the LWRE. Anthropogenic aerosols on the other hand have smaller particle sizes and therefore have negligible effects in the longwave.. In these studies, dust concentrations are based on the distributions of vegetation, soil texture and soil moisture. The mass concentrations are converted to aerosol optical thickness AOT values and DRE is obtained using radiative transfer calculations that require wavelength dependent aerosol properties. However, large uncertainties exist even in the sign of the DRE. Alternatively some studies use satellite-retrieved AOT and radiative transfer calculations to convert the spectral optical thickness to obtain the radiative effect of all aerosols over the entire shortwave spectrum while others combine the satellite-retrieved AOT with broadband radiative flux measurements to examine the DRE of all aerosols that do not require radiative transfer calculations. that are more suited for aerosol research. For example, to estimate DRE of dust aerosols. We account for diurnal variations using methods described by . Dust AOT can then be derived by combining equations 1 – 3 and solving for  Using 18 months of collocated CERES and MODIS data from six years June–August, 2000–2005 over the Atlantic Ocean, we calculate both the cloud-free SWRE and LWRE of dust aerosols. Our results indicate that 20% of the SWRE is cancelled by the LWRE with a SW and LW radiative efficiency of −47.91 ± 3.81 Wm −2 /AOT and +8.96 ± 3.51 Wm −2 /AOT respectively. Over source region such as deserts, due to the high surface albedos, the SWRE is usually small and difficult to estimate where as the LWRE could be significant thereby further underscoring the thermal effects of dust aerosols. Currently there is no consensus on the anthropogenic fraction of dust aerosols and these values could range from 0–50%. However, if the tropospheric dust loading due to anthropogenic activities is indeed significant, then the thermal effects of dust aerosols could partially offset the shortwave radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols since anthropogenic aerosols due to their small particle sizes have negligible radiative effects in the thermal portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is the first multi-year assessment of the combined shortwave and longwave TOA radiative effects over the Atlantic Ocean and work is underway to extend this analysis over the global land and ocean areas."
176,aerosol ocean,"Is the top of atmosphere dust net radiative effect different between Terra and Aqua?. [1] We assess the difference in Top of Atmosphere TOA cloud-free Net Radiative Effect NRE of dust aerosols between the Terra and Aqua satellites using three years of collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer MODIS and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System CERES data over the Atlantic Ocean [0-30 degrees N, 10-60 degrees W]. The dust aerosol optical thickness at 0.55 mu m tau dust was first separated from the total aerosol column aerosol optical thickness tau and our results indicate that the Terra minus Aqua difference for both t and t dust is approximately 10%, with Terra values generally being slightly higher. The resulting difference in TOA NRE from dust aerosols is less than 1 Wm -2 . The difference between Terra and Aqua NRE lies well within previously reported uncertainties indicating that data from either satellite can be used interchangeably if independent adjustments for diurnal effects and clear-sky sample biases are made. . The radiative effect of ‘natural aerosols’ such dust and marine is called DRE, whereas DCF is the contribution from anthropogenic aerosols. However, most of these studies used Terra satellite data which is in a sun synchronous polar orbit with a descending equatorial crossing time of ∼10:30 am. In these satellite-based studies, primarily over the global oceans, the common approach is to take the aerosol optical thickness retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS on Terra and then assuming that this value is representative of the entire day, radiative transfer RT calculations are performed to compute diurnally averaged top of atmosphere TOA solar radiative fluxes. In these RT calculations the surface, atmospheric, and aerosol properties are usually assumed to be constant during the day and calculations are simply averaged over different solar zenith angles. For shortwave calculations, these approaches require wavelength dependent usually between 0.2 to 4.5 assumption that Terra and Aqua  The lack of any measurable difference in MODIS τ between Terra and Aqua indicates the difference observed with the CERES-SSF products are not a reflection of a significant change in aerosol concentration or their scattering properties between Terra and Aqua overpass times. The lack of correlation with Terra-Aqua cloud fraction difference indicates that Terra-Aqua AOT/NRE differences are not a product of change in cloud cover from morning to afternoon. or radiative efficiency methods must be used to account for the sample biases. Without this adjustment, the reported NRE would be too low as a result of the clear-sky bias apparent when using the CERES-SSF data. Assuming that appropriate bias adjustment is applied, the difference in Aqua and Terra dust NRE is less than 5%. This difference is more or less randomly distributed and is well within the uncertainties reported by other studies."
178,climate aerosol ocean,"Does dust from Patagonia reach the sub-Antarctic Atlantic ocean?. Although emission of dust from the Patagonia desert is shown by global aerosol models, there is conflicting observational evidence of dust activity in the region. Because dust from Patagonia into the Southern Ocean SO may play a role in regulating phytoplankton activity, it is necessary to confirm whether there is dust activity and if so, how far the dust travels into the SO. We used a combination of surface visibility, satellite measurements MODIS and OMI and transport model HYSPLIT to track and report for the first time a dust event originating in Patagonia. We show that the dust reached the free troposphere in the Sub-Antarctic Atlantic Ocean. Although the dust emission was significant, cloudiness and dilution of the plume resulted in difficult conditions to track dust in the SW Atlantic. We show that the use of any single tool i.e., MODIS or OMI is not enough to track the dust and only an integrated approach of satellite and modeling tools can achieve a consistent description. As a result, current platforms used for dust detection are probably underestimating aerosol loading in the area. . Ice-cores studies in Antarctica show that fluctuations in atmospheric CO 2 correlate with dust deposited in the Antarctic ice sheet. Because dust layers were deposited right before an observed decrease in atmospheric CO 2 , one current theory hypothesizes that iron-rich dust blown from Patagonia during the drier glacial times deposited over the SO and promoted removal of atmospheric CO 2 due to the iron-fertilization effect in primary productivity. Although controversial, this theory has received a boost in recent years due to the results of dedicated field experiments which showed an increase in phytoplankton mass due to an artificial increase of iron.. In particular, , satellite observations offer a mixed picture. For example, studies with the TOMS detector indicate that Patagonia is an active source of dust but observations with the MODIS detector do not show important dust activity. Thus, our knowledge of dust activity in the area is limited to modeling studies and it is uncertain whether Patagonian dust can reach the high-nutrient low-chlorophyll waters of the Sub-Antarctic Ocean or even Antarctica.. Every 2 to 4 days during spring and summer, low pressure perturbations move north into the land mass generating storms with sustained wind speeds reaching above 70 km/h for several hours. Gusts above 110 km/h are frequently reported. The lack of the soil moisture, sparse vegetation cover and strong surface winds provide the appropriate conditions for dust emission. In general, dust activity is highest during the summer months, but winter and fall dust events have also been reported.. Relevant to this study is the aerosol optical depth AOD which can be related to aerosol concentration. A typical value of background oceanic AOD in this area is ≤0.1. The MODIS aerosol products are reported at a 10 × 10 km ground resolution and only under clear sky conditions. Version or collection 5 of the aerosol algorithm is used in this study. In addition, a second source of data is the Ozone Monitoring Instrument OMI onboard of the satellite Aura which flies in formation of a few minutes behind the Aqua satellite. Although OMI is primarily used as an ozone instrument, it is also sensitive to aerosol absorption in the ultra-violet region a spectral region not measured by MODIS and it provides independent information of the aerosol present in the scene under observation. Specifically, because dust absorbs in the UV-bands and sea-salt does not, the aerosol index AI measured by OMI provides a tool to differentiate the main two aerosol types commonly found in this area. Unlike MODIS, the AI is sensitive to aerosol absorption even when the particles are above a cloud. Thus, AI is derived in both cloudless and cloudy conditions. OMI has a ground resolution of the order of 13 × 24 km nadir . OMI is the heritage instrument of TOMS and uses a retrieval algorithm of AI similar to the one used by TOMS. An AI > 1 is considered typical of absorbing aerosols such as smoke or dust. The combination of aerosol measurements of MODIS and OMI is unique in that it is possible to locate the presence and the type of aerosol at high spatial resolution. A third source of data used in this study was provided by the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model HYSPLIT . HYSPLIT utilizes a Lagrangian approach to estimate the emission, advection, dispersion, and deposition of dust. For this application, HYSPLIT assumes a top hat 2D disc mass distribution in the horizontal and a Lagrangian particle in the vertical to describe the air parcels. Finally, surface observations of standard meteorological variables including visibility and cloud cover at several airports along the coast of Patagonia were obtained directly from the Argentine National Weather Service. The surface observations were reported every hour and provided a ground truth of the state of the atmosphere before and after the satellite passes..  On April 6, NCEP reanalysis maps show that the low pressure system displaced eastward to south of South Georgia island. In addition, surface and 850 mb winds were consistently from the west in most of the SW South Atlantic region. Around 51S,40W, the wind direction shifted from W to N-NNW and remained with a constant direction along the ∼37W meridian. Figure 3 left shows the MODIS AODs as a composite of two Terra 13:30 and 13:35 UTC, left side of panel and two Aqua granules or passes 15:55 and 16:00 UTC, right side of panel . Cloudless conditions were prevalent in the SW Atlantic and most of the AODs retrieved are well below 0.1, consistent with very low aerosol loadings. We note two regions with higher than background AODs. One located east of the Malvinas Falklands Is. The presence of patches of aerosols and the abrupt change in AOD in contiguous pixels suggest the presence of a field of scattered clouds. As a result, it is possible that many clear sky pixels are cloud contaminated east of the Malvinas islands. A second area of interest is the streak of higher than background AODs. It follows an arc from approximately 46S,53W and bends south following the 39W meridian it reaches the NW tip of S. Georgia island. The location of the streak follows the wind direction suggested by the NCEP synoptic charts. The texture of the streak is smooth and continuous and it is surrounded by clear sky pixels. All these factors strongly suggest that the high AODs pixels have minimal cloud contamination and that MODIS detects non- background aerosol concentrations. However, at these moderately high AODs 0.1–0.4 , the spectral signature of dust and sea-salt aerosols or the mixture of both is approximately the same in the MODIS bands. Thus it is not possible to determine the aerosol type from MODIS measurements alone. Figure 3 right shows OMI AIs South Pole crossing at 17:24 UTC for clear sky pixels and it provides some insights on the nature of the aerosol detected by MODIS. OMI shows that the high AODs east of Malvinas islands are not consistent with dust. Inspection of the respective MODIS true color picture not shown confirms the presence of abundant mid level clouds and high level cirrus. With respect to the arc of high AODs reaching S. Georgia Island, the AIs are below 1 in the section of the arc with highest AODs. When the arc bends south, the AI increases to reach the highest values south-west of S. Georgia. We note that the OMI AIs are more sensitive to absorbing aerosols above the boundary layer and the sensitivity decreases towards the surface particularly if the aerosol concentrations are low. This is not the case for April 05 where OMI was clearly sensitive to the sources at the surface when concentrations were the highest Figure 1 . However the day after, dilution and removal processes in the boundary decrease aerosol concentrations resulting in a weak absorbing signal seen by OMI. As a result, we cannot confirm by using only satellite measurements that the high AODs seen by MODIS in the 46S, 51W region can be attributed to dust. This also applies to the high AODs east of Malvinas Is. However, the higher than 1 AIs along 39W from 48S to 58S are consistent with the high AODs along the same meridian. We note that MODIS detects high AODs only north and west of S Georgia island whereas OMI shows absorbing aerosols SW of the island. We attribute the discrepancy to the time difference between MODIS-Aqua and OMI observations. The Aqua granules in Figure 3 left were captured ∼1.5 hrs before the OMI pass.MODIS AODs left panel and OMI AI right panel, polar pass 17:24 for April 6, 2006. The MODIS figure is a composite of two Terra granules left side and two Aqua granules right side . MODIS shows a streak of high AODs around 47S,50W continuing to NW of S. Georgia Is. OMI agrees with MODIS in the streak from 47S,45W to 57S,38W with increasing aerosol absorption from N to S. The model output shows a distribution of particles that follows an arc extending from west of Malvinas Is to south of S. Georgia Is. Due to the presence of clouds, it is not possible to verify the existence of the west end of the arc in the MODIS AODs Figure 3 . However, the east half of the arc agrees with the location of high AODs and AIs detected by MODIS and OMI respectively. Furthermore, both MODIS and HYSPLIT agree on the location of the maximum concentration. The agreement between model and observation strongly suggests the presence of dust in the streak of high AODs observed by MODIS. In addition, the vertical distribution of dust from HYSPLIT provides useful information to interpret the OMI observations. The right panel in Figure 4 shows the vertical distribution of dust along the arc. At the center of the arc where concentrations are the highest, the dust is mostly concentrated in the boundary layer. As the dust in the east end advects towards the south, it rises due the presence of a low pressure center south of S Georgia Island. As a result, the dust along ∼39W is located well above the boundary layer. Therefore, the modeled vertical distribution of dust is consistent with the fact that OMI was only sensitive to absorbing aerosols above the boundary layer north and south of S. Georgia but not sensitive to the streak of high AODs within the boundary layer as reported by MODIS. The fact that MODIS shows relatively high AODs north of S. Georgia, that OMI shows high AIs south of the island and that modeling transport places dust in the same area constitutes strong evidence that Patagonian dust reaches the atmosphere above Sub-Antarctic Atlantic Ocean.[12]  We note that after its passage by South Georgia, the dust reaches the free troposphere over Antarctica 48 hours after its emission according to HYSPLIT estimations not shown . However, because the proximity to the polar night at such high latitudes and sea-ice, there are no MODIS and OMI retrievals that can corroborate the presence of dust in the Antarctic atmosphere.[13]  This study reports first observational evidence of a dust event in Patagonia as detected by satellite. Although this analysis did not study the deposition and chemistry of dust necessary factors to consider for fertilization of phytoplankton , it does highlight some important facts regarding emission and the long range transport of dust in Patagonia. Our observations confirm that dust advects through the SW Atlantic Ocean and it can reach the area around the biological rich sub-Antarctic Ocean within 30 hours of emission. The event here described exemplifies that the intensity of dust emission in Patagonia can be significant and very localized Figure 1 . However, the cloudy conditions that accompany the event make automatic satellite detection very difficult since satellite algorithms rely on the clear sky conditions MODIS and/or dust above clouds OMI prior to the analysis of aerosol content in the pixel. In addition, the target area of interest high latitude southern ocean possesses intrinsic difficulties for appropriate aerosol retrievals such as the lack of good viewing geometry or dark background there is sea-ice present a significant part of the year . Furthermore, there is an extra degree of difficulty for automatic satellite detection of aerosols even in the presence of clear sky conditions. Patagonia dust emission appears to be short lived. As shown in this case, the dust event lasted a few hours and the natural dilution and removal processes downwind Patagonia lowered dust concentrations. This results in a weak satellite signal as expressed in this case by the moderately high optical depths and near 1 aerosol indexes measured by MODIS and OMI respectively. Therefore, the satellite tracking of dust in the South Atlantic is a difficult task and most likely to produce an underestimation of satellite based dust concentration retrievals. The analysis here presented is the most appropriate to track the dust with existing tools. We showed that only a combined approach of different satellite detectors aided by an aerosol transport model can yield a more robust answer on the transport of Patagonian dust in the SW Atlantic. Furthermore, the use of MODIS or OMI alone will not give a definitive answer on the fate of dust transport in the area. However, an integrated approach that takes advantage of the strengths of satellite and transport model methods can yield a consistent description of dust activity in the area."
180,particles climate aerosol,"Nanofiber calcite in Asian dust and its atmospheric roles. Calcite is the most important mineral in Asian dust, and it reacts with atmospheric gases during its long-range transport. Mineralogical and chemical analyses of Asian dust and source soils showed two types of calcite that differ greatly in morphology and origin: i micron-sized irregular particles derived from the erosion of bedrock, and ii nanosized fibers that were chemically precipitated in soils. In Asian dust aerosol particles, these nanofibers were internally mixed with clay minerals, often coating quartz and feldspar grains together with clay minerals. Nanofiber-bearing aerosol particles were more abundant than the coarser calcite particles. The nanofibers reacted to form sulfate coatings on minerals, providing a significant contribution to the optical, chemical, and hygroscopic modifications of Asian dust due to their enhanced reactivity. Asian dust is basically a mineral aerosol, and its mineralogical diversity needs to be characterized before a proper estimation of its climatic, geochemical, and ecological roles and provenance. , by changing the number of cloud-condensation nuclei, by providing reactive surfaces, and by supplying micronutrients to remote marine and terrestrial ecosystems during its long-range transport across Korea, Japan, and the North Pacific from the desert and loess regions in northern China and Mongolia. Anthropogenic pollutants are also transported from the industrialized areas of eastern Asia together with Asian dust. The optical and chemical properties of Asian dust change during its transport through an interaction of the reactive mineral particles with atmospheric gases.. It is estimated that 50%–70% of the total annual mass of sulfate and about 40% of that of nitrate are associated with mineral dust over East Asia, and these are transported to the central Pacific Ocean. Radiative forcing of fine sulfate aerosols will be affected if SO x reacts with mineral dust during the long-range transport. Characterization of individual aerosol particles is important in determining the extent of the reaction between Asian dust particles and atmospheric gases. Particles of Asian dust are generally characterized using electron microscopy, and are classified into simple chemical types. However, Asian dust consists of mineral particles lifted from arid soils, and so it requires mineralogical characterization before its radiative, geochemical, and ecological roles are assessed because the mineral reactivity of Asian dust varies widely from species to species, and even within a species, depending on crystal size, crystallinity, and chemistry. Here, we report a wide diversity of calcite in terms of size, morphology, and origin from mineralogical investigations carried out on Asian dust and source soils, and discuss the relationship of the observations to the chemical modification of Asian dust..Sample numbers indicate day/month/year.Total iron.. Their identification using polarizing microscopy and a conventional SEM may have been difficult because of their nanosize and their close association with the clay aggregates. They can be classed as nanofiber calcite based on their very thin width of several tens of nanometers. These nanofibers were only found in samples containing coarse calcite particles derived from rocks, including all the loess silts and desert Sand-B. We believe that the coarse calcite particles in the loess silts and desert sands were dissolved during the short wet spells during the occasional rainfall or snowfalls, and were reprecipitated as nanofibers by the rapid evaporation of the soil solutions in the arid environment.Electron micrographs of calcite particles in the source soils. a SEM-BSE image of a thin section of Sand-B.

The TEM images of the sulfur-bearing particles show an overgrowth of calcium sulfate on the surface of the clay particles Figure 2f , which is probably because of the reaction of the nanofiber calcites with sulfuric acid.The number of clay particles analyzed by TEM-EDS.The number of clay particles whose sulfur content exceeds detection limit 0.12% total weight of Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Ti, Mn, Ca, Na, K, P, and S were normalized to 100% .The average sulfur content of the clay particles from which sulfur was detected., because nanofiber calcites are expected to be much more reactive compared with the coarser calcite particles, which have a size of several microns. The high surface area of the nanofibers shortens the reaction time during the rapid long-range transport on the prevailing westerly winds.[10]  Desert sands in the source regions of northern China generally lack nanofibers, while silts in the loess plateau are rich in nanofibers. If there are any variations in the source regions of the Asian dust between the desert and loess samples, then there may be variations in the chemical properties and reactivity of the Asian dust samples. For example, clay-rich aerosol particles with abundant nanofiber calcites in the Asian dust must have originated from the loess regions rather than the sandy desert region, strongly indicating the reworking of the loess. The capability of acid neutralization and the transportation of sulfates and nitrates to remote environments could be increased when the Asian dust samples are enriched in nanofiber calcites. These nanofibers are also expected to be found in the remote sediments, soils, and ice cores along the migration route of the Asian dust, and to become a useful proxy for the exogenic dust originating in the dry lands."
181,particles aerosol,"Chemistry of aerosols over a semi-arid region: Evidence for acid neutralization by mineral dust. A two-year study based on chemical characteristics of ambient aerosols, from an urban site of a semi-arid region in western India, provides an unequivocal evidence for the quantitative neutralization of acidic constituents by mineral aerosols. The mineral dust component varied in the range 16-220 mu g m -3 Av: 88, sd: 42 ; and contributed to 69 +/- 5% of the TSP range: 43-273 mu g m -3 , Av: 125, sd: 49 . A characteristic feature of the in-situ chemical reactions is well reflected by the relative dominance of Ca2+ and HCO3- ions in the water-soluble composition of aerosols and anti-correlation among HCO3-/Ca2+ and ""Excess Acid""/Ca2+. A ubiquitous alkaline-nature of rainfall events over this high dust region further attests to our chemical data. Such regional-scale atmospheric transformation processes suggest the over estimation of negative radiative forcing climate cooling due to sulphate aerosols in the global climate models. . They provide surface for in-situ atmospheric chemical transformation processes, and thus, have the potential to undergo a variety of heterogeneous reactions with atmospheric gases. In principle, it is possible that heterogeneous chemistry of atmospheric aerosols can change both gas-phase chemical balance of the atmosphere and the physico-chemical properties of individual particles such as size, shape, composition and hygroscopicity ; which in turn will alter aerosol optical properties and may have an impact on the Earth's climate.. Several parts of Asia arid and semi-arid regions act as perennial source of mineral dust in the atmosphere. Model calculations indicate that 50 ± 20% of the total atmospheric dust mass originates from disturbed soils. Mineral aerosols interact with O 3 , SO 2 , HNO 3 and NO x , which can significantly influence the chemistry of the troposphere. Many of these gases such as SO 2 and NO x are released into the atmosphere by coal burning, vehicular emissions and industrial processes. It is, thus, essential to quantify the processes that control their transport, evolution, and subsequent deposition. Some of the recent field observations have reported on acid neutralization by CaCO 3 based on correlation among Ca 2+ and NO 3 − measured in bulk-aerosols.. Rastogi and Sarin . The regional climate is typical of a semi-arid region with annual rainfall of ∼650 mm, all of which occurs during the SW-monsoon Jun–Aug . For their chemical characterization, bulk-aerosols were collected on pre-cleaned tissuquartz filters 200 × 250 mm 2 using a high-volume air sampler. A total of 65 samples were collected over a span of two years January 2001–December 2002 with a frequency of ∼3 samples per month a sample every 10th day and were analyzed for water-soluble inorganic constituents by Ion-Chromatography. Simultaneous analysis of Al, Fe, Ca and Mg was also carried out in acid-digested HF + HNO 3 filters by ICP-AES. For details on analytical procedures adopted and data quality, reference is made to the work by Rastogi , but independent analysis of HCO 3 − ion in water-soluble fraction is essential to document and quantify the acid uptake by mineral dust.. The major source of Na + and Cl − is ascertained as sea-salts based on observed Cl − /Na + ratio characteristically similar to seawater. Using Na + as a reference element, sea-salt components of Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , K + and SO 4 2− have been ascertained. During the dry period Jan–Apr, Sept–Dec , sea-salt contribution of Ca 2+ , SO 4 2− and K + were relatively insignificant <5% . Under the influence of SW-winds May–Aug , contribution of sea-salts to water-soluble Ca 2+ , SO 4 2− and K + was estimated to be 4, 15 and 40%, respectively. These observations have led us to conclude that sea-salts contribution to Ca 2+ is insignificant and that Ca 2+ and HCO 3 − are predominantly derived from mineral dust; whereas abundances of NH 4 + , K + , NO 3 − and SO 4 2− are dominated by regional-scale pollution sources. . The mineral dust exhibits co-variance with TSP and constitutes 57 to 81% of the total mass seasonal average varying as ∼70, 75, 65, 68 and 70% during Jan–Feb, Mar–Apr, May–Aug, Sept–Oct and Nov–Dec, respectively, Figure 1 . The dominance of mineral dust and its role in regional-scale atmospheric chemistry is also reflected from the observed pH range: 5.2 to 8.2, average: 6.7 and chemical composition of individual precipitation events studied for a three-year period 2000–2002 . The abundance of anthropogenic species has been estimated by adding the concentrations of NH 4 + , K + , NO 3 − and SO 4 2− ; their contribution ranged from 2 to 12% of the TSP with larger contribution ∼8% occurring during winter months Jan–Feb, Nov–Dec, dominated by NE-winds and lower ∼4% during Mar–May maximum dust season, Figure 1 and wet season Jun–Aug, SW-winds . a Temporal variability in the abundance of Total Suspended Particulate TSP during the annual cycle of two-year over the study site Ahmedabad . b Relative contribution of mineral aerosols to TSP during different season suggests the perennial dominance of mineral aerosols. and thus resulting in lower HCO 3 − /Ca 2+ ratio: Alternatively, a significant fraction of nss-SO 4 2− and NO 3 − could originate from regional dust as CaSO 4 gypsiferous soils and CaNO 3 , i.e. all nss-Ca 2+ does not exist as carbonates. However, the possibility of dominant contribution from the latter source has been ruled out based on the linear regression analysis among nss-SO 4 2− , NO 3 − and Al proxy of mineral dust that exhibits a large scatter.. Based on the above reasoning, the fraction of acidic species neutralized by NH 4 + and nss-K + in equivalent units has been subtracted from the total acid TA and remaining acid is termed as “excess acid”.Average abundances of total acid TA = nss-SO 4 2− +NO 3 − and excess acid EA = TA − NH 4 + + nss-K + during different seasons for the two-year data.The anti-correlation in temporal variability of EA/Ca 2+ water and HCO 3 − /Ca 2+ water ratios suggests that the significant amount of HCO 3 − is titrated out by EA in aerosols. Based on the intensive 2-years long measurements carried out for the chemical composition of bulk-aerosols, collected from an urban site of a semi-arid region in western India, it is demonstrated that mineral dust particles accounting for 60–80% of the total aerosol mass exhibit extensive reactivity with the acidic species NO 3 − + nss-SO 4 2− . On annual basis, uptake of “excess acid” varying from 28 to 145 neq m −3 is quite evident from the inverse relationship between water-soluble HCO 3 − /Ca 2+ water and “excess acid”/Ca 2+ water as well as Ca 2+ water /Ca total and Ca total ; arising due to neutralization of acidity and increased solubility of calcium carbonate.[12]  The chemical reactions among acidic species and mineral dust should significantly alter the size distribution of sulphate and nitrate aerosols from fine to coarse mode . In addition, surface properties of mineral dust would be altered from hydrophobic to hydrophilic due to coating of SO 4 2− and NO 3 − at mineral surface, which in turn may increase the ability of mineral dust to act as CCN. Due to change in their size distribution, the residence time of acidic species in the atmosphere may decrease and their dry deposition may increase. Therefore, such regional scale studies need to be taken into consideration while estimating radiative forcing due to sulphate aerosols and mineral dust."
359,climate aerosol,"Observational relationships between aerosol and Asian monsoon rainfall, and circulation. Preliminary observational evidences are presented showing that the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions are subject to heavy loading of absorbing aerosols, i.e., dust and black carbon, which possess spatial and temporal variability that are closely linked to those of the Asian monsoon water cycle. Consistent with the Elevated Heat Pump hypothesis, we find that increased loading of absorbing aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic Plain in the pre-monsoon season is associated with a increased heating of the upper troposphere, with the formation of a warm-core upper level anticyclone over the Tibetan Plateau in April May, b an advance of the monsoon rainy season in northern India in May, and c subsequent increased rainfall over the Indian subcontinent, and decreased rainfall over East Asia in June-July. . The dimming effect is global even though sources of aerosols are local, because of the abundance and diverse geographic locations of the sources, continuous emission, and long-range transport of aerosols. In Asian monsoon regions, the dimming effect is especially large due to heavy pollution, and frequent occurrence of dust storms. Recent atmospheric general circulation model GCM experiments have demonstrated significant impacts of aerosols on the Asian monsoon. demonstrated that absorbing aerosols dust and black carbon , may intensify the Indian monsoon through the so-called “Elevated-Heat-Pump” EHP effect. While these studies indicate plausible but different scenarios of aerosol impacts, they also suggest that aerosol effects on monsoon water cycle dynamics are extremely complex, and strongly dependent on aerosol distribution and characteristics, as well as on spatial and temporal scales.. The AI data set is the only multi-year longer than decade continuous daily global record for absorbing aerosols, starting in November 1978 and, with the exception of a data gap from May 1993 to August 1996, to the present. For rainfall, we use the Global Precipitation Climatology Precipitation GPCP data, which combines surface rain gauge data as well as merged satellite estimates covering the period 1979–present. For wind, temperature and moisture, we use the NCEP/DOE-R2 reanalysis data... The dusts in Region I are coated with black carbon produced from local emissions and become a strong absorber of solar radiation and an efficient source of atmospheric heating. Since aerosol emission, concentration, and transport are dependent on the large scale circulation and rainfall, the total dust loading in all three source regions undergo multi-scale variability associated with the monsoon climate system.Climatological 1979–2001 distribution of absorbing aerosols over the Indian subcontinent and adjacent areas based on the TOMS Aerosol Index AI for April–May showing a the bi-monthly mean distribution, and b the monthly standard deviation, and c Area mean daily AI, and total rainfall bar charts over Region I. Key source regions are marked by numbered rectangles in Figure 1b. Shaded columns in Figure 1c mark the March–April–May season. AI is in normalized unit, and rainfall unit is in mm day −1 . and many others . This is also obvious from the all-India rainfall shown in Figure 1c . We note from Figure 1c that the build-up of absorbing aerosol is abnormally strong in the spring season leading up to the monsoon season in 1988, and mush less so in 1987. Similarly, in 1991, the all-India rainfall in May increased following a spike in the AI in early May and rain increased further in June following a second spike of AI in late May or early June. These observations are obviously anecdotal, but they do beg the question, whether a strong build up of aerosol in spring can be a contributing factor to an intensification of the monsoon. In the following, we use composite and regression analyses to further explore this question. and many others . Over the entire monsoon region 0–25°N , the rainy season seems to have advanced with more rain appears in the early, but less rain in the latter, part of the season.Time-latitude cross-sections showing composite seasonal evolution during year of high loading of absorbing aerosols of a the AI anomalies, and b the observed rainfall anomalies, and c composite of rainfall and 850 hPa wind pattern during years of high AI anomalies. Unit of rainfall is in mm day −1 , and wind is m sec −1 .. However, examination of individual events, and comparing between the high and low AI composites show large variability, indicating that the features over the subtropical western Pacific may be case dependent. To further quantify the relationship between pre-monsoon aerosol-induced tropospheric heating over the Tibetan Plateau and subsequent changes in the monsoon circulation, we have carried out a regression analysis including statistical significance test of monthly mean TOMS AI with temperature and wind from NCEP reanalysis. As mentioned in Section 3b , and confirmed by the regression analysis, the downstream features over East Asia and the East China Sea have large variability and low confidence, we therefore restrict the following analysis and discussion to significant features over the subcontinent of India and the Arabian Sea. Figure 4a shows the lagged regression pattern of layer-averaged surface to 300 hPa temperature and 300 hPa wind data for May–June on TOMS AI over the IGB Region I in Figure 1b for April–May over the entire domain. It is evident that a build up of aerosol in April–May over the IGB is associated with the development of a pronounced upper level tropospheric warm anomalies, coupled to an anomalous upper level large-scale anticyclone in May–June over northern India and the Tibetan Plateau, with strong northerlies over 75–90°E, 20–25°N, and easterlies across the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea at 5–20°N. The large-scale warm-core anticyclone associated with increased aerosol appears to be coupled to an upper level cold-core cyclone situated to its northwest. The dipole pattern is consistent with Rossby wave response in temperature and wind to increased diabatic heating over India and the Bay of Bengal, and reduced heating northwestern India/Pakistan/region. At 850 hPa, the regression patterns show general increase in rainfall associated with enhanced convection over India, with the most pronounced increase over the Bay of Bengal, and the western coastal region of India in June–July. At this time, anomalous westerlies are found spanning the Arabian Sea, across the Indian subcontinent, and ending up in a cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal. Throughout the May–June–July period, the large-scale circulation patterns in the upper and lower troposphere imply a large increase in the easterly wind shear, and a deepening of the Bay of Bengal depression. Both are signals of a stronger South Asian monsoon. We also found signals, albeit somewhat weak and noisy, indicating an increase in upper tropopsheric water vapor over the Bay of Bengal and the northern Indian Ocean not shown , consistent with increased “pumping” of moisture into the upper troposphere by the increased convection. Previous studies have found significant a relationship between upper tropospheric anticyclone and water vapor over the Tibetan Plateau during the summer monsoon, using satellite and aircraft data. The weak water vapor signal we found may be related to the poor quality of NCEP upper tropospheric water vapor. The linkage of aerosol heating and upper tropospheric water vapor is clearly a subject of future studies related to this work.Regression of TOMS AI index over the IGB in April–May with a layer-averaged anomalous tropospheric temperature from surface to 300 hPa, and wind at 300 hPa in May–June and b anomalous wind at 850 hPa and rainfall in June–July. Regions exceeding 90% significances indicated by thick contours for temperature, and rainfall, and by thick arrows for wind. Contour intervals are 0.05° K for temperature, and 0.2 mm day −1 for rainfall.[11]  Our observation results are consistent with the key features of the EHP effect proposed by [2006] in showing that the anomalous high concentration of absorbing aerosol during the pre-monsoon season is associated with a anomalous warming associated with the development of a large-scale anticyclone in the upper troposphere over the Tibetan Plateau in May and June, b an advance of the monsoon season, with increased rainfall coming to northern India during May, and c subsequent enhancement of the monsoon rain over India in June–July. Although the present analysis is focused on seasonal-to-interannual time scale, based on ongoing work, the relationships shown may also hold on decadal to climate change time scales reflecting the increased loading of the black carbon from anthropogenic sources in the IGB. Our results will provide guidance and new avenues for exploring monsoon variability and predictability. Aerosol effects on the monsoon water cycle may be important in years when influence from other controlling factors sea surface temperature, land surface processes, and internal dynamics are relative small, or incoherent so that they cancel out. Additionally, aerosol may have amplifying or damping effects when interacting with these factors. Therefore aerosol-monsoon water relationships have to be explored in conjunction with SST, snow cover and other agents of change in future studies."
183,aerosol,"Climate response and radiative forcing from mineral aerosols during the last glacial maximum, pre-industrial, current and doubled-carbon dioxide climates. Mineral aerosol impacts on climate through radiative forcing by natural dust sources are examined in the current, last glacial maximum, pre-industrial and doubled-carbon dioxide climate. Modeled globally averaged dust loadings change by + 88%, + 31% and - 60% in the last glacial maximum, pre-industrial and future climates, respectively, relative to the current climate. Model results show globally averaged dust radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere is - 1.0, - 0.4 and + 0.14 W/m 2 for the last glacial maximum, pre-industrial and doubled-carbon dioxide climates, respectively, relative to the current climate. Globally averaged surface temperature changed by - 0.85, - 0.22, and + 0.06 degrees C relative to the current climate in the last glacial maximum, pre-industrial and doubled carbon dioxide climates, respectively, due solely to the dust radiative forcing changes simulated here. These simulations only include natural dust source response to climate change, and neglect possible impacts by human land and water use. . Additionally, mineral aerosol deposition to high latitude ice cores are 2–20 times higher during cold periods, such as the last glacial maximum, than warm periods like today; and marine sediment records suggest that globally dust deposition is 3–4 times higher during cold periods than warm periods. Thus, the large expected changes in dust deposition in response to climate can play an important role in modulating climate., there have not been published simulations of the climate response of mineral aerosols under different climate regimes using realistic dust distributions. Additionally, there have been limited estimates of radiative forcing under different climates. Here, we include both estimates of radiative forcing for four different time periods, as well as the climate response to those dust radiative forcings in the National Center for Atmospheric Research's NCAR Community Climate System Model CCSM3 . We include only the climate response to ‘natural’ sources of desert dust, because current estimates of the land use or water use impacts are not well constrained see . The dust source, transport, and deposition parameterizations used for these simulations are described briefly in Text S1 in the auxiliary material and in detail by . Radiative forcings and climate response are calculated as described by and . Simulations for the current and doubled-carbon dioxide climate are based on the ocean heat fluxes of the fully coupled system in the current climate.. For this paper, climate response is calculated relative to the case where this forcing is turned off, described by , following the methodology of , using the default vegetation in the model SOM . For the last glacial maximum, we include a case where glaciogenic sources are included and tuned to match observations SOMBLGMT . We deduced the size of these sources using an optimization algorithm and available observations terrestrial sediment, ice and marine sediment cores , and use those source areas for this study. These simulations, including comparisons to observations concentration, deposition and aerosol optical depth are described in more detail by . The globally averaged dust source changes by +105%, +164%, +51% and −64% relative to the current climate SOMB for the SOMBLGMC, SOMBLGMT, SOMBPIC, and SOMBDC cases, respectively, when dust direct radiative feedback is included in the models Table 1 . The latitudinal distribution of the sources expands to northern high latitudes under last glacial maximum conditions, similar to previous studies. Notice that adding the impact of the glaciogenic sources on dust and tuning the model to best match the observations increases our dust source and loading in the extra-tropics in the last glacial maximum in our simulations SOMBLGMT vs. SOMBLGMC . Atmospheric desert dust aerosol optical depth 500 nm changes dramatically during the different climates due to the changes in source strength Figure 1a . Globally averaged dust aerosol optical depth AOD change by +81%, +88%, +31% and −60% in the SOMBLGMC, SOMBLGMT, SOMBPIC and SOMBDC cases relative to the SOMB case, respectively Table 1 . The response of dust sources and deposition to climate change is discussed in more detail and compared to available observations from  Dust radiative forcing changes with climate and the amount of dust, and the radiative forcings are highest at the latitudes with the most dust, although the relationship is not strictly linear Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c . The globally averaged largest radiative forcings are seen in climates with the largest change in aerosol optical depth Table 1 . Our top of atmosphere radiative forcing tend to have larger longwave and smaller short wave components than previous modeling studies, although these results are consistent with available observations, as discussed in detail by  The climate response to dust can occur at different latitudes than the radiative forcing. Here we show the difference in surface temperature radiative between the case where dust radiative forcing is included in the climate simulation minus the case where there is no radiative forcing, for each climate. The response of surface temperature to dust radiative forcing tends to be between 0.1 and 2.1 °C cooling, and these values are statistically significant across a broad range of latitudes Figure 1d . The strongest cooling occurs in northern midlatitudes Figure 1d , even when the dust optical depth and radiative forcing has a larger magnitude in the tropics Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c . The strongest response in temperature occurs at 40–90 °N in the last glacial maximum cases, and is approximately 2 °C. It is unclear why the response should be largest at northern midlatitudes, but it could be due to the lower heat capacity of land versus ocean, and the large portion of land at this latitude. Radiative forcings and climate feedbacks from atmospheric desert dust for last glacial maximum, pre-industrial, current and doubled-carbon dioxide climates are calculated for the first time in one single modeling framework. Included in these dust scenarios are changes in dust sources due to changes in vegetation using the BIOME3 equilibrium vegetation model and glaciogenic sources in the last glacial maximum. We include in the model only the response due to vegetation changes, soil moisture and surface winds in this simulation, and ignore possible changes due to human land or water use; estimates of anthropogenic radiative forcing and climate feedbacks including land use are given in Text S1 , based on previous studies. Comparisons of the dust distribution in this study to available observations is conducted in a separate paper; and shows a good performance of the model. The net instantaneous top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing differences due to dust between the last glacial maximum, pre-industrial and doubled-carbon dioxide climates and the current climate are −0.53, −0.43, and +0.14 W/m 2 , respectively. If we include the impact of glaciogenic sources, the net top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing difference between the last glacial maximum and the current climate increases in magnitude to −1.04 W/m 2 . In the future we simulate a 0.14 W/m 2 increase in radiative forcing because of a reduction in dust from carbon dioxide fertilization of the vegetation. It is uncertain that the carbon dioxide fertilization effect will continue in the future, when other nutrients may become limiting. Indeed other studies include the impact of climate induced desertification and obtain a significant increase in desert dust in the future while others simulate little change, suggesting that more studies of vegetation and climate interactions are vital to predicting future dust.. The sensitivity of dust feedback results to optical properties is explored by  In the last glacial maximum, our results suggest a radiative forcing relative to the current climate of −1.04 W/m 2 at the top of atmosphere, for the case including glaciogenic sources and best matches available deposition observations. Compared to the forcings from carbon dioxide −1.7 W/m 2 and insolation and albedo −5.2 W/m 2 , the dust forcings are about 15% of the total of other forcings. The surface temperature response from dust is −0.85 °C relative to the current climate, while the changes in carbon dioxide, insolation and albedo in the same simulations cause a change in surface temperature of 5.6 °C.[14]  Despite the possible sensitivity of the results to our model specifications, our results suggest some interesting relationships across the different climate studies. Radiative forcing at the top-of-atmosphere and surface is linear with aerosol optical depth, even in different climates. Climate response in surface temperature and precipitation are roughly linear with aerosol optical depth in our model, with a decrease in both surface temperature and precipitation associated with increasing optical depth. Finally, our model predicts statistically significant decreases in temperature at many latitudes not just close to the dust sources when dust is added in the different climates, and a shift in precipitation from the northern part of the ITCZ to the southern part of the ITCZ."
184,dust atmosphere aerosol climate,"Reconstructing the weather on Mars at the time of the MERs and Beagle 2 landings. We reconstruct the temperature, wind and density structure of the atmosphere on Mars from the surface to 120 km altitude at the time of the landing of the two NASA Mars Exploration Rovers MER , and ESA's ""Beagle 2."" This reconstruction is based on an assimilation of temperature and dust opacity observations from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer aboard the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft into a general circulation model of the Martian atmosphere and, for the case of the MERs, on retrievals of temperature and density profiles from accelerometer data. For all landers, the reconstruction of the atmospheric state is compared with the climatological state predicted by the European Mars Climate Database EMCD for two different prescribed dust scenarios, with added large- and small-scale variability. This comparison exhibits good agreement for all three landers within the modeled variability, confirming a posteriori the accuracy of the climate forecasts by the EMCD. . The lander was successfully released from the parent spacecraft on December 19th, six days before arrival at Mars. After its release, no communication with Beagle 2 was possible until landing. The planned contact with Beagle 2 after landing was never established and the lander was eventually declared lost., and reference therein for overviews of the mission. Both the rovers were equipped with an accelerometer, and data recorded during the descent and landing have been analyzed to retrieve profiles of temperature, pressure and density.... Independent retrievals of temperature and density profiles from accelerometer data during the landing of Spirit and Opportunity are also used. The reconstructed atmospheric state during the three landers' EDL is compared to the climate forecasts provided by the EMCD version 3.2 for two different prescribed dust scenarios “baseline” and “warm” , taking into account large and small scale variability.. The database is described by  Data assimilation is an approach which has been made possible on Mars by the availability of a substantial data set of MGS measurements with good spatial and temporal coverage. The development and early applications of this technique for Mars have been carried out by , and . In this paper, TES observations of temperature and total dust opacity in nadir mode below about 40 km altitude were assimilated into the Oxford version of the LMD/AOPP MGCM, as detailed by . Temperature, density, zonal and meridional wind profiles as a function of height above the surface were reconstructed along the trajectories of the MERs and above the presumed landing site of Beagle 2 from atmospheric entry about 120 km altitude down to the ground. The density profile at Spirit's landing site was corrected as detailed above.. In the present work, atmospheric densities along the two entry trajectories of Spirit and Opportunity were determined using the drag equation and measured spacecraft accelerations. Pressures and temperatures were then derived using the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law. Details of the method are given by Withers and Smith , while the latter are responsible for much of the interannual variability, owing to their strong impact on the thermal and dynamical state of the lower atmosphere due to absorption of visible radiation by dust particles. Although large regional storms are generally concentrated around perihelion which on Mars occurs at solar longitude L s = 251° , local storms can occur at any time of the year.. In particular, at the time of the landing of Beagle 2 L s = 322.0°, Martian year 26 and the two MERs L s = 327.7° and L s = 339.1° , TES zonally-averaged optical depth shows a peak due to the occurrence of regional storms started in Chryse Planitia and the region between Argyre and Hellas Planitias Noachis Terra . As a consequence, the optical depth at the landing sites was slightly larger than expected compared to the previous two years of MGS observations, although not outside the expected long-term climatological variability.. The equivalent visible opacity inferred by the assimilation is about twice that of the measured infrared one, as expected. According to the assimilation, therefore, Beagle 2 should have experienced an equivalent visible total optical depth at 610 Pa of about 0.8 at the time of landing. Such visible opacities are much larger than the EMCD opacities of the baseline scenario at the corresponding time of year, which are 0.19 Beagle 2 , 0.18 Spirit and 0.17 Opportunity . The opacities of the warm EMCD scenario respectively 0.92, 0.78 and 0.74 , however, agree better with the equivalent visible measured ones. MGS/Mars Orbiter Camera MOC images show that the regional dust storms which started around L s = 315° had already faded out, although an enhanced veil of dust was still present in the atmosphere, particularly at the time of the landing of Spirit. You can find MOC images at http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/mer_weather/ . See also auxiliary Figure S1 . As a consequence, the best fit of the actual temperature profiles in the lower atmosphere below 50 km altitude is obtained by using the warm EMCD dust scenario rather than the baseline scenario, especially for the case of Spirit see Figure 1 . For Opportunity, the fact that both the assimilation and the accelerometer temperature profiles are in better agreement with the baseline dust scenario above 90 km altitude might indicate that most of the dust had already moved to lower altitudes at that time see Figure 2 .Temperature, density, zonal and meridional winds along the EDL trajectory of Spirit. The smooth, thin line is for assimilation, the thick line is for the retrieval from accelerometer data dotted lines bound the corresponding 1 − σ errors , and the light grey lines are from the EMCD. Two dust scenarios are shown for the temperature profiles of EMCD, as described in the text. Density and wind profiles are only shown for the warm scenario. Density is plotted as relative difference in per cent with respect to the average of EMCD densities.As Figure 1 , for the case of Opportunity..  Auxiliary Figure S1 mentioned above shows that two regional dust storms were active at the time of the landing, one in Meridiani Planum and the other one in Noachis Terra. Neither of them affected directly the landing site in Isidis Planitia, but certainly they contributed to increasing the amount of dust loading overall in the atmosphere. As a consequence, the EMCD ensemble of temperature profiles with the warm scenario is found to be in very good agreement with the assimilation along the whole range of EDL, within a few K see Figure 3 .Temperature, density, zonal and meridional winds at the landing site of Beagle 2. The black solid lines are the reconstruction from the assimilation and the light grey lines are from the EMCD. Two dust scenarios are shown for the temperature profiles of EMCD, as in Figure 1 . Density is plotted as relative difference in per cent with respect to the average of EMCD densities. The black solid line shows the difference between the assimilation and the mean EMCD warm dust scenario; the dashed line shows the difference between the assimilation and the mean EMCD baseline dust scenario. EMCD variability about the mean density in grey is shown for the warm scenario only.. Densities appear to be larger than expected above 85 km altitude, where a peak of almost 40% difference is reached around 100 km altitude. This difference is due to the steeper lapse rate of temperature in the assimilation compared to the EMCD above that altitude. The reconstructed meridional wind strength is in close agreement with EMCD for both dust scenarios , likewise the zonal wind, at least below 40 km altitude. No evidence for anomalous large scale wind is found in the lower atmosphere. The largest difference below 40 km altitude lies within an error of ±10 m s −1 . This does not exclude possible strong gusts which might have affected the landing of Beagle 2 before touching down.[27]  Landing a spacecraft on Mars requires a good forecast of the weather conditions at the time and location where the landing might occur. This means relying on past observations and model forecasts. Data assimilation could play a more important role in the future, if this technique were to be implemented at the level of an operational forecast. This in turn needs frequent observations on global and local scales.[28]  Nevertheless, we have demonstrated in this paper that the reconstruction a posteriori of the weather at the time when Beagle 2 and the two MERs landed on Mars is in good agreement with the climatological state as provided by the EMCD, if the full variability predicted by this database is taken into account.[29]  In fact, no evidence for systematic errors in the EMCD climate forecast was found. The atmospheric dust loading was higher than that at the same point in the preceding two Mars years, but within the range of conditions which might be expected in the absence of a global dust storm. As a consequence, the reconstructed temperature, density and wind profiles generally agree better with the warm dust scenario than with the baseline one.[30]  These results highlight the importance of taking into account the full variability provided by the EMCD for critical applications such as EDL design, given the observed strong interannual variability of the Martian atmosphere."
186,climate,"Satellite-based assessment of possible dust aerosols semi-direct effect on cloud water path over East Asia. The semi-direct effects of dust aerosols are analyzed over eastern Asia using 2 years June 2002 to June 2004 of data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System CERES scanning radiometer and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS on the Aqua satellite, and 18 years 1984 to 2001 of International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project ISCCP data. The results show that the water path of dust-contaminated clouds is considerably smaller than that of dust-free clouds. The mean ice water path IWP and liquid water path LWP of dusty clouds are less than their dust-free counterparts by 23.7% and 49.8%, respectively. The long-term statistical relationship derived from ISCCP also confirms that there is significant negative correlation between dust storm index and ISCCP cloud water path CWP . These results suggest that dust aerosols warm clouds, increase the evaporation of cloud droplets and further reduce the CWP, the so-called semi-direct effect. The semi-direct effect may play a role in cloud development over arid and semi-arid areas of East Asia and contribute to the reduction of precipitation.  if the total cloud water content remained unaffected, constitutes the indirect effect on climate. Another important aspect of aerosols, especially absorbing aerosols, such as black carbon and mineral dust, is their semi-direct effect. Aerosol absorption at solar wavelengths could contribute to increased diabatic heating in the atmosphere and enhance cloud evaporation. who used a more sophisticated GCM. When the aerosol-induced cloud feedbacks were included, the GCM-predicted warming increased from 2.5 K to 2.9 K. The additional warming was related to decreases in the fractional coverage of large-scale clouds, particularly at mid and high latitudes. The semi-direct aerosol effect was also investigated by , who found a decrease in global averaged column liquid water and ice associated with the semi-direct effect.. Measurements of the complex refractive index of atmospheric dust aerosols in central Asia suggested that significant absorption of solar radiation could exist due to the considerable range of values for the imaginary part of the refractive index. . VISST has typically relied on the assumption that all clouds are homogenous in a single layer. The cloud properties derived from the entire reflected visible radiance represents the combined effects of all cloud layers. When the entire reflected radiance is interpreted with an ice cloud model, the optical depth of the ice cloud can be severely overestimated because the underlying water cloud can significantly increase the reflectance. However, in this study we are only interested in the dust effect on the total cloud water path i.e., the ice water path + liquid water path of the entire atmospheric column . The retrieval of total water path is accurate enough for this analysis. are also analyzed here. Like VISST, the ISCCP only detects clouds with optical depths greater than about 0.3. The errors for liquid water should be within ∼20% while those for ice increased to ∼50%. ISCCP data may not be the best means for detecting the effect of dust on clouds but it is the longest available data record. To combine the effect of the cloud optical depth τ and cloud amount cloud fraction , the composite cloud albedos CCA are estimated using the formula: where CF i is the cloud amount for specific cloud type i , such as cirrus cloud in a 2.5° × 2.5° box from ISCCP D2 dataset, and α cloud i is the cloud albedo, expressed as α cloud i = τ i / τ i + 6.7 obtained from a two-stream radiative transfer model. To compare cloud properties at similar meteorological conditions the CWP in the CLD and COD categories were plotted as a functions of T e Figure 2 . Both the COD IWP Figure 2a and LWP Figure 2b are less than the corresponding values for dust-free clouds over the full range of observed cloud top temperatures 225 K < Te ≤ 260 K . In Figure 2a , the variation of IWP shows that the IWP decreases with increasing T e . The significant IWP difference between the CLD and COD clouds occurs throughout the full range of the ice cloud temperatures. For example, the CLD IWP is around 250 g/m 2 when Te = 245 K, while the COD value is about 200 g/m 2 . For water clouds, the large difference between dust-free and dusty CWP can be found in middle layer clouds Te ∼ 250 K . The LWP values in the COD category increase with T e while the variations of CLD LWP are generally similar to those for CLD IWP and only decrease with increasing Te. This indicates that the effects of dust aerosols are more significant on LWP in middle layer clouds, where upper layer aerosol heating due to the absorption of solar radiation may be strong and directly affect the cloud evaporation. Figures 1 and 2 suggest that the dusty CWPs are considerably smaller than those of dust-free clouds, which may be due to cloud evaporation caused by dust aerosol absorption or wet precipitation of dust.Comparison of the cloud water path over the CLD region with the COD region as a function of effective cloud top temperature Te for a IWP and b LWP.. The second could be that dust aerosols absorb incoming solar radiation, which heats the cloud layer and increase evaporation, as previously discussed. The observed results may be due to a combination of the two causes. It can also be seen that positive correlations between CCA and TDI exist in portions of Northeast Asia. Although the correlations seen in Figures 3 and 4 can be explained by the two causes mentioned previously, we cannot eliminate the possibility that some meteorological factors are simultaneously forcing both dust aerosol and cloud changes. In a given month, windy/stormy conditions at Taklamakan are generally associated with more frequent cold front systems over China that move along the path from northwest to southeast China. These fronts can cause a significant number of dust storms in the arid and semiarid areas of northern China and produce more clouds in the wet regions of south China. This is the reason for the huge negative correlation stripe in northern China starting from the dust source region all the way to the east end of the analyzed domain. For the branch of southward dust movement, additional clouds could be generated in southeast China due to humid environments, especially for areas near ocean. The region of positive correlation upper-left corner contains areas typically behind dust storm cold frontal systems, where additional clouds would be produced by more frequent and/or stronger cold fronts. While the negative areas in the western and southern corner of the analyzed domain are typically mountainous regions that have different dynamics from the Taklamakan.Distribution of correlation coefficients between monthly anomalies of Taklamakan dust storm index TDI and ISCCP composite cloud albedo CCA for total cloud.Same as Figure 3 but for the total water path of total cloud.. Due to the large spatial and temporal extent of desert dust in the atmosphere, the interactions of desert dust with clouds can have substantial climatic impacts. The decrease of cloud optical depth and water path partially reduces the cloud-cooling effect. A previous study indicates that the desert dust might contribute significantly to the observed reductions in cloud droplet size and precipitation over Africa. However, this study shows that the semi-direct effect may be the dominating factor of dust aerosol-cloud interaction over arid and semi-arid areas in East Asia, and contribute to the reduction of precipitation via a significantly different mechanism as compared to that in Africa. Dust storms may have contributed to the desertification of the Northwest China during recent decades. The results presented here represent only a first step in better understanding the effect of Asian dust on climate. Further research should be focused on measurements of physical processes of aerosol-cloud interactions."
187,ocean,"Assessment of MODIS-derived visible and near-IR aerosol optical properties and their spatial variability in the presence of mineral dust. Mineral dust aerosol is among the most difficult aerosol species to measure quantitatively from space. In this paper, we evaluate MODIS retrievals of spectral aerosol optical depth AOD from the visible to the near- IR off the US West Coast using measurements taken by the NASA Ames Airborne Tracking Sunphotometer, AATS- 14, during the EVE Extended- MODIS-lambda Validation Experiment, 2004 campaign in April of 2004. In EVE, a total of 35 and 49 coincident over- ocean suborbital measurements at the nominal level- 2 retrieval scale of 10 km x 10 km were collected for Terra and Aqua, respectively. For MODIS- Terra about 80% of the AOD retrievals are within the estimated uncertainty, Delta tau = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau; this is true for both the visible here defined to include 466 - 855 nm and near- IR here defined to include 1243 - 2119 nm retrievals. For MODIS- Aqua about 45% of the AOD retrievals are within Delta tau = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau; the fraction of near- IR retrievals that fall within this uncertainty range is about 27%. We found an rms difference of 0.71 between the sunphotometer and MODIS- Aqua estimates of the visible 553 - 855 nm angstrom ngstrom exponent, while the MODIS- Terra visible A ngstrom exponents show an rms difference of only 0.29 when compared to AATS. The cause of the differences in performance between MODIS- Terra and MODIS- Aqua could be instrument calibration and needs to be explored further. The spatial variability of AOD between retrieval boxes as derived by MODIS is generally larger than that indicated by the sunphotometer data. , yet it is among the most difficult aerosol species to measure quantitatively from space. The observational challenges stem from the lack of knowledge on dust particle shape and absorption, and from the spatial inhomogeneity of dust plumes, which makes it difficult for certain cloud masking techniques to distinguish them from cirrus clouds. Several field campaigns in recent years have been partially devoted to evaluating satellite retrievals of mineral dust properties. The timing and location of the EVE Extended-MODIS- found no significant difference between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua in their ability to determine AOD between 466 and 855 nm. AATS-14 measures direct solar beam transmission in narrow channels with bandwidths between 2 and 5.6 nm for the wavelengths between 354 and 1558 nm and 17.3 nm for the 2139 nm channel by using detectors in a tracking head that is mounted externally to the aircraft. From the measured slant-path transmissions we derive the aerosol optical depth AOD , All suborbital measurements considered in this paper were taken within ±30 minutes of satellite overpass time at aircraft altitudes below 80 m usually at altitudes of 30–40 m . Within each grid box, the AATS-14 measurements of AOD were averaged to yield a spectrum, which was then fitted with a quadratic least-square fit of log  Based on coincident measurements with the NASA AATS-14, we have evaluated i MODIS retrievals of spectral AOD from the visible to the near-IR, ii MODIS retrievals of the visible 553–855 nm and near-IR 855–2119 nm Ångstrom exponents, iii changes in AOD and Ångstrom exponents between adjacent MODIS retrieval boxes. The timing and location of these measurements were chosen to maximize the likelihood of encountering Asian dust transported across the Pacific Ocean, providing a measurable AOD at wavelengths beyond 855 nm. Our assessment of the presence of mineral dust is supported by NAAPS NRL Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System model results and by the in situ instrumentation on the aircraft a 3- [2005], who found a correlation in differences between MODIS and suborbital AOD measurements with MODIS-derived cloud fraction. A more careful assessment of this effect on the basis of airborne sunphotometer data in multiple field campaigns in the vicinity of clouds is forthcoming, but beyond the scope of this paper."
188,dust climate aerosol,"Impact of human-induced desertification on the intensification of Sahel dust emission and export over the last decades. Human-induced soil degradation in Sahel is a major concern for regional climate change. A significant increase in long-range atmospheric dust transport due to human activities would indeed modify the radiative budget and the water cycle over both Africa and the tropical Atlantic. Here we use two independent long-term datasets, i.e., surface concentration measurements at Barbados between 1965 and 2000 and maps of TOMS dust optical thickness between 1979 and 2000, to evidence an increase of a factor of two of background dust loads over the Atlantic since the mid 60' s, independently of any climatic phenomenon. Satellite imagery suggests that this trend can be attributed to an intensification of dust emissions in a Sahel region centered on southern Mali. The desertification caused by the doubling of the population in Sahel over the last 40 years likely explains the observed intensification of the Atlantic dust export. . The largest dust plumes can darken the sky over thousands of km 2 and often reach the Americas. The climatic impact of African dust is however not accounted for in most climate change simulations because mineral dust is considered as a natural aerosol, which is not affected by human activities. The existence of significant dust sources due to soil degradation by land use mostly agriculture and pasture in Sahel is uncertain and has never been observed yet. The concept of human-induced desertification itself is actually still debated in the scientific community because it is difficult to separate the respective contributions of climate and human activities on soil degradation in Sahel. have shown that disturbed soils in Sahel might contribute significantly to the amount of dust transported over the Tropical Atlantic Ocean. These studies suggest that African dust has an important anthropogenic fraction that can possibly evolve rapidly during the next century. These results have however been recently cancelled out by another couple of modeling studies, which show respectively that this anthropogenic contribution is small and that current global models are likely not accurate enough to address this issue. Here we perform a careful examination of existing long-term satellite and ground-based measurements in order to assess if there is any observational evidence of the impact of human-induced soil degradation in Sahel on African dust export.. The longest satellite archive for tracking African dust plumes over both Africa and Atlantic is made of only 18 years of daily maps of the dust optical thickness DOT estimated from the aerosol index product of the Total Ozone Mapping Sensor TOMS . This dataset goes back to 1979, but no data are available between 1993 and 1996 because of the lack of sensor in orbit, and data after 2000 cannot be used because of an unexplained calibration drift of the sensor http://jwocky.gsfc.nasa.gov/aerosols/aerosols.html . Note that another satellite archive made of METEOSAT images can be used to complement the TOMS dataset over the Atlantic, and that data from OMI Ozone Monitoring Instrument will be used in the future to continue the satellite dust archive. as well as the inter-annual variability of the export of African dust. They have shown that the Sahelian Annual Drought SAD controls the mean dust export of the following year through a change in the intensity of dust emissions in Sahel. The North Atlantic Oscillation NAO also participates to this variability, but mostly during winter. This natural variability of African dust export over the tropical Atlantic is so high that it makes difficult to evidence any potential trend due to a human-induced desertification over a period of time of 20 years. The only other dataset that provides measurements over a longer period is the dust station at Barbados, with systematic and consistent measurements of surface dust concentrations SDC since 1966. Here we use 33 years of annual mean SDC recorded at Barbados between 1966 and 2000, years 1969 and 1970 being discarded because less than 6 months of measurements were available. In this paper, the 18 years of TOMS DOT 1979–2000, years 1993–1996 missing are used to complement the long-term Barbados dust record and to infer the geographical distribution of the dust variability.. The Barbados dust time-series can thus be used as a good proxy for the long-term monitoring of African dust export to the Atlantic. Figure 1 shows that the variability of annual mean SDC can be predicted with a good accuracy using a multiple linear regression on both NAO and SAD indices. The equation of this regression is SDC = 6.09 × SAD + 0.85 × NAO + 10.36 and its correlation coefficient R multi is of 0.71 for the 33 years two-tailed probability p > 99.9% . For comparison, a lower correlation coefficient of 0.62 is found if the NAO index is not considered to perform the regression. These two indices are computed from in situ measurements, i.e. from difference in atmospheric pressure at two Atlantic stations for NAO and from precipitation anomalies of the previous year over Sahel for SAD, and have been shown to account for most of the inter-annual variability of the two meteorological phenomena. Except for three specific years 1983, 1987 and 1988 , both intensity and temporal evolutions of the dust loads are generally well captured using such a simple parameterization. An explanation for the poor agreement in 1983 is that the SAD index used in this study gives a less intense drought for this year than other indices, which were not used because they do not cover the whole period. However this explanation does not hold for 1987 and 1988 for which the various SAD indices available are similar and lead to a drier year in 1988 than in 1987, contrary to what would suggest the measurements.Annual mean Surface Dust Concentration SDC measured at Barbados between 1966 and 2000 filled circles and predicted using a multiple regression depending on both North Atlantic Oscillation NAO and Sahel Annual Drought SAD indices open circles . Diamonds show the difference ΔSDC between measured and predicted SDC values. The equation of the linear regression is ΔSDC = 0.175 ±0.054 × Year − 347 ±108 , with R = 0.50. As for the Barbados dataset, a multiple regression was thus performed on the annual mean TOMS DOT in function of both SAD and NAO indices for each grid cell over Africa and tropical Atlantic. The temporal trend of the difference between measured and predicted DOT values was computed for each grid cell for which the climatological mean annual DOT is greater than 0.1 and the multiple regression is significant R multi > 0.6; two-tailed probability p > 99% . These two criteria enables to remove artificial temporal trends that might show up in regions of low DOT or in regions where the NAO and the SAD do not satisfactorily account for the natural inter-annual variability of DOT. Figure 2 shows that the difference between measured and predicted DOT has increased by 30–50% between 1979 and 2000 in the region of maximum dust export over the tropical Atlantic. Considering the difference between the two datasets, this trend is consistent with that of 30% at the Barbados station see Figure 1 and confirms an intensification of the background dust transport, i.e., in the absence of any specific meteorological perturbation such as a drought, over the last decades. a Climatological 1979–2000 mean annual TOMS Dust Optical Thickness DOT at 0.55. Figure 3 shows that the region of southern Mali with the highest temporal trend, corresponds well to the region of maximum desertification due to wind erosion on human-induced degraded soils. This part of Mali, centered on the Niger loop and located between 13°N and 15°N and between 3°W and 10°W, is one of the most inhabited region in Sahel FAO . It is widely used for both pastoralism and agriculture and is thus directly affected by the increasing demand of fast-growing cities in Sahel. Note that a small region in Niger, in the vicinity of the city of Agadez 17°N, 8°E , also shows a DOT increase that seems to coincide with severe soil degradation. This provides the first observational evidence that human-induced desertification in Sahel, whatever its extent and intensity, is likely responsible for an increase of 30 to 50% of the background dust export i.e., the dust export for normal drought and NAO conditions to the tropical Atlantic over the last two decades of the 20th century, and probably for an increase of about a factor of two since the mid 60's. This increase is lower than that due the inter-annual variability due to drought, but it is permanent and thus significant in terms of climatic impact. a Same as Figure 2b but for the slope of the temporal linear regression year −1 applied to the difference between the predicted and the measured annual mean DOT.

However our findings have also strong implications in terms of population health in Africa but perhaps also in Europe and Americas, which experience frequent dust intrusions. Dust has indeed been shown to irritate lungs and thus to create propitious conditions for the transmission of the bacteria responsible for Meningococcal meningitis during the dry season in Sahel, and to carry viable fungi and bacteria up to Florida in southern USA. A permanent increase in the export of dust from Sahel could thus have large sanitary impacts in forthcoming decades."
189,dust ocean,"Mineral particle size as a control on aerosol iron solubility. Aerosol iron solubility is a major uncertainty in the global biogeochemical cycle of iron and, via its impact on ocean productivity, the carbon cycle and their influence on global climate. Previous studies have reported widely different values for this solubility 0.01 - 80% . Here we show that the primary control on aerosol iron solubility is the surface area to volume ratio of mineral aerosol particles, which changes during atmospheric transport as mineral aerosol concentration decreases due to preferential removal of larger particles assuming particle morphology to be relatively constant with particle size . This important result indicates that aerosol iron solubility is not fixed, but will change predictably as an inverse function of dust concentration on both spatial and temporal e.g. glacial interglacial scales. . Numerous studies, using a wide variety of starting materials and analytical techniques, have reported aerosol Fe solubility values over a very broad range 0.01 – 80% and there has been much debate as to which of these values are applicable to the environment. Studies on the solubility of Fe in soils generally report lower values than observed in atmospheric aerosols and several workers have used laboratory results to suggest that chemical or photochemical mechanisms during transport through the atmosphere might be responsible for this effect. However, field and modelling studies on the influence of atmospheric processing on Fe solubility have generally been unable to confirm that these processes have a significant effect. The majority of work in this area has been carried out on desert soils or aerosols because mineral dust generated in deserts constitutes by far the largest source of Fe to the ocean. We recently conducted the first systematic study of the solubility of Fe in aerosols from diverse source regions between 50°N and 50°S in the Atlantic Ocean using a weak acid leach and reported that Fe solubility varied systematically with aerosol source, Saharan dust having the lowest values. Here, however, we reanalyse that, and other, data to elucidate the fundamental processes regulating aerosol solubility.. Mineral aerosol atmospheric mass loadings m d were calculated from total aerosol Al concentrations by assuming that all aerosol Al was derived from mineral dust, which comprises 7% by mass Al. In order to illustrate the variation in mineral aerosol surface area to volume ratio A/V with changing particle size we make a simplistic assumption of spherical particles and hence. The A/V-concentration plot reproduces the overall form of Figure 1 . Particle solubility is fundamentally a surface process and we therefore suggest that changes in the mean surface area to volume ratio of the mineral aerosol population, caused by progressive removal of larger mineral aerosol particles during transport, account for the trend in aerosol Fe solubility shown in Figure 1 . Here we assume that particle morphology is similar across the mineral aerosol size spectrum. Some differences in morphology for instance, very rough large particles versus smooth small particles might counteract the trend in A/V with concentration that we propose. In general however, we suggest that as mineral aerosol particles become smaller a greater proportion of their volume is exposed and therefore available for dissolution.The variation in surface area to volume ratio A/V of a simple spherical particle with atmospheric concentration m d calculated for observed mineral particle sizes and mass loadings for near-source mineral dust A , dust sampled off the coast of West Africa B , and Saharan dust observed over the Caribbean C . Also shown are data for various literature reports of paired particle size and mineral aerosol concentration filled squares, open squares, filled diamond, open diamonds, open triangles and the general form of the A/V vs m d relationship extrapolated to lower dust concentrations.. It may also explain why solubilities reported for desert soils, used as proxies for desert dust aerosol, are generally lower than those reported for aerosols, because sieving of soil samples to separate fine fractions <∼ 65 μm , is extremely difficult without the use of wet sieving techniques. Wet sieving cannot be used because of the potential for altering the soluble fraction of Fe present. Chen and Siefert , which used similar weak acid leaching protocols to ours, also exhibit similar behaviour see auxiliary material .. As a result, the absolute magnitude of Fe solubility in Figure 1 is probably over-estimated somewhat. However, the relative solubility characteristics of the aerosol samples are recorded by these methods. In terms of the global Fe and C cycles, the important parameter is how much aerosol Fe is soluble in seawater or bioavailable to marine organisms . The solubility of Fe in seawater is extremely low, but may be enhanced by organic ligands with a high affinity for Fe. Thus the overall solubility of aerosol Fe on deposition to the ocean will be dependent on the pre-existing dissolved Fe concentration in the seawater and the presence and nature of Fe-binding organic ligands there, as well as the size of the aerosol mineral particles. Our results through application of a single analytical method to real aerosol samples collected over a huge gradient in dust concentrations reveal the nature and extent of the atmospheric control on aerosol Fe solubility over such large concentration gradients. This will be subsequently modified by effects in seawater after deposition to the ocean.. The effect of this trend in Fe solubility will be to smooth out the strong gradients in atmospheric iron dust supply to the ocean, with proportionately less soluble Fe delivered to areas close to major dust sources and more to remote areas e.g. the Southern Ocean , relative to most current models, which use a fixed value for aerosol Fe solubility. However, the observed variation in aerosol solubility is at least an order of magnitude lower than that in dust deposition, so that gradients in soluble Fe inputs to the ocean, consistent with global patterns of iron limitation in ocean waters, will still be present. More recent models do incorporate variable aerosol Fe solubility, parameterised as a function of atmospheric chemical processing which is computationally expensive. Our results suggest that the link between atmospheric processing and Fe solubility is primarily physical rather than chemical in nature, and can be readily parameterised in global models as a function of transported mineral dust concentration. Variations in atmospheric iron supply to the oceans over temporal scales e.g. glacial – interglacial timescales will also be modulated, because of the implied non-linearity in inputs of soluble iron with inputs of total iron. Our results remove some of the uncertainty involved in discussion of aerosol Fe solubility and imply that debates over the “correct” value for this parameter are inappropriate."
157,dust,"Assessment of second-generation MODIS aerosol retrieval (Collection 005) at Kanpur, India. The second-generation MODIS aerosol retrieval Collection 005 from EOS- Aqua 2002-2005 was evaluated using ground-based AERONET measurements at Kanpur 26.45 degrees N, 80.35 degrees E northern India. We found that the aerosol optical depth AOD retrievals are more accurate compared to that of previous retrieval Collection 004 . About 70% of the total retrievals at 0.47 mu m and 0.55 mu m and 60% of the retrievals at 0.66 mu m wavelength in the new version fall within the pre-launch uncertainty Delta tau = +/-0.05 +/- 0.15 tau, where tau is AOD with better correlation R-2 similar to 0.83 at all three wavelengths. However, MODIS still tends to over-estimate AOD for a few retrievals in the presence of dust aerosols. The error in the fine-dominated AOD was large for most retrievals in the C005. However, the fine-dominated AOD of Collection 004 was better correlated with the equivalent AERONET data. This suggests that the fine-dominated AOD retrievals need to be re-examined further. . Ground-based measurements of aerosols provide critical information on aerosol physical and optical properties however, they are limited to a small region and aerosols exhibit high spatio-temporal variation. Therefore, these measurements cannot be applied to the remote areas where ground-based aerosol measurements do not exist. Satellite remote sensing of aerosols in this regard play an important role in monitoring and characterizing aerosols regionally as well as globally which is a prime requirement to assess the impact of aerosols on Earth's climate. The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS sensor on board NASA's. The entire old algorithm C004 was restructured to incorporate the following major changes in the new algorithm: 1 the new algorithm uses updated aerosol models based on and RT3 radiative transfer code that accounts for the effects of polarization, 3 the new algorithm no longer assumes that the 2.1 and Version 2 respectively.Scatter-plot of aerosol optical depth between MODIS and AERONET at 0.47, 0.55 and 0.66 μ m wavelengths. A total of 236 matched points are used from Aqua /MODIS 2002–2005. The dashed solid line is a linear regression fit for all data points and solid lines represent pre-launch uncertainty over land: Δ τ = ±0.05 ± 0.15 τ , where τ is aerosol optical depth. The regression equation at each wavelength is given at the top of the plot. method is based on the fitting an effective optical size distribution to the spectral AOD derived from direct sun measurements. Hence, the FMW derived by MODIS is not the same quantity as that obtained from the AERONET. However, the definitions of FMW are similar enough so that they should be correlated with each other.. The MODIS-derived fine-dominated AOD was also compared with that retrieved using O'Neill's method AERONET, Level 1.5 but there was no significant difference noted from the Dubovik retrieval. Figure 3 shows the spatial and seasonal distribution of monthly mean FMW derived from Aqua /MODIS monthly C004 product Figure 3 , top and C005 product Figure 3 , bottom over the Indian subcontinent. The FMW value was less than 0.2 over large part of India in all three seasons this means that the new MODIS algorithm has used the dust aerosol model in most cases for the AOD retrieval. This is in contrast with the C004 in which MODIS had used both fine-dominated models and dust model depending on the season and aerosol type in the AOD retrieval. The large error in the FMW retrieval at Kanpur could be attributed to the non-uniqueness of the inversion problem where the AOD retrievals are more accurate but the choice of aerosol model is somehow inappropriate. The new MODIS algorithm chooses one value of out of thirteen values of η , where η is the FMW, which provides the best spectral fit in radiance measured by MODIS at top-of-atmosphere. In the present case, the spheroid dust model assumed in the V5.2 provides the best spectral fit in radiance measured by MODIS at top-of-atmosphere zero error at 0.47 μ m and minimum error at 0.66 μ m in most cases. We believe that the new algorithm missed out other values of η which might have slightly larger error in fitting spectral radiances measured by MODIS. Unlike the previous version of algorithm C004 in which the selection of the dynamic aerosol model was based on the ratio of path radiance in 0.66 μ m and 0.47 μ m, the new algorithm does not use the spectral dependence of aerosol path radiance which is a useful information in selecting non-dust and/or dust model for the retrieval.Comparison of MODIS-derived fine-dominated AOD left and fine model weighting right with the AERONET inversions at Kanpur for period 2002–2005. The open circles and closed circles denote Aqua /MODIS Collection 004 retrievals old version and Collection 005 retrievals new version respectively. The number of points used N and correlation coefficients R 2 are given separately for both the dataset.Spatial and seasonal distributions of monthly mean fine-dominated model weighting derived from Aqua /MODIS monthly top C004 product and bottom C005 product over the Indian subcontinent.[10]  The performance of the new MODIS aerosol algorithm V5.2 was tested using ground-based AERONET data at Kanpur, India. Compared to the previous version C004 , the aerosol optical depth retrievals were more accurate at all wavelengths and well correlated with AERONET data. This could be due to the improved estimation of visible surface reflectance using parameterized reflectance relationship and updated new aerosol models used in the algorithm. However, MODIS still tends to over-estimate aerosol optical depth for few retrievals in the presence of dust which requires further investigation. The error in the fine-dominated AOD was too large for most retrievals in the C005 data whereas fine-dominated AOD of C004 showed better correlation with the equivalent AERONET data. This suggests that the new retrieval of fine-dominated AOD and fine-dominated model weighting over the Indian region need to be re-examined."
158,dust,"Anthropocene changes in desert area: Sensitivity to climate model predictions. Changes in desert area due to humans have important implications from a local, regional to global level. Here I focus on the latter in order to better understand estimated changes in desert dust aerosols and the associated iron deposition into oceans. Using 17 model simulations from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multi- model dataset and the BIOME4 equilibrium vegetation model, I estimate changes in desert dust source areas due to climate change and carbon dioxide fertilization. If I assume no carbon dioxide fertilization, the mean of the model predictions is that desert areas expand from the 1880s to the 2080s, due to increased aridity. If I allow for carbon dioxide fertilization, the desert areas become smaller. Thus better understanding carbon dioxide fertilization is important for predicting desert response to climate. There is substantial spread in the model simulation predictions for regional and global averages. . Previous studies have highlighted the potentially important role that human induced climate change will have on desert size and dust generation. However, previous studies have used only one or two models in order to assess the impact of climate onto mineral aerosols. In this study I explore the predictions of climate change from 17 different general circulation models compiled in World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 CMIP3 multi-model dataset and use the BIOME4 model to convert the precipitation, insolation and temperature changes from those models into predictions of desert. The goals of this study are 1 to identify desert dust source regions which may change or already have changed due to the impact of anthropogenic climate change, and 2 to look for the sensitivity of the results to the general circulation model used for the climate predictions.. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations influence plant stomatal conductance because as CO 2 diffuses into the leaf, water diffuses out. This effect is particularly pronounced under conditions of low atmospheric humidity, where stomatal control is an important regulator of net CO 2 uptake by plants. Under high ambient CO 2 concentrations, more CO2 could be expected to diffuse into the leaf for unit water loss, increasing plant water use efficiency and thus productivity and survival under arid conditions. There is evidence that this mechanism exists in the real world, but the magnitude is controversial. Therefore I include sensitivities studies of the impact of carbon dioxide fertilization effects in the simulations in order to determine the importance of this mechanism.. The impact of water use on atmospheric dust has also not been assessed at a global level, but a recent study suggests no trend in dustiness downwind of the Aral Sea, which has substantially reduced in size during the last 50 years due to human water use. While human land use is likely to be important for desert dust generation, it is beyond the scope of this study to consider.. In addition, there may be fluctuations in the transport and lifetime of the aerosols that are different in different climate models, which I cannot account for in this study. I also neglect the feedback of changes in desert or desert dust itself onto climate in this study. However, this study represents a significant step forward, as changes in the source areas can account for a large fraction of the changes seen in different climates.. This model determines the optimal plant functional type for each grid cell on a 0.5 × 0.5 degree cell based on which type out-competes the other plant types. This model will determine the equilibrium vegetation, which is attained in many ecosystems after hundreds of years. Because the vegetation in arid regions like annual grasses is likely to respond quickly to the evolution of the climate, I can use the model for 20 year average time slices every 50 years to look at the evolution of the deserts as predicted by this set of models.. It is thought that anomalies from the current climate are more robust that the absolute value for different climates. Monthly averaged model results for 1880–1900, 1940–1960 and 1980–2000 were taken from the twentieth century runs from the CMIP3 dataset. Simulated monthly means for the 2040–2060 and 2080–2100 time period were taken from the A1b scenarios. Monthly anomalies were derived for each time period and used to drive the BIOME4 model to equilibrium for each grid box. Variables taken from the model output datasets were precipitation, temperature and cloudiness changes. The models included in this study are shown in Figure 1 . I use the model designation of the desert biome for this discussion. The desert biome is generated in the BIOME4 model when the leaf area index is below 1.0 for woody desert plants, or when the net primary productivity is below 100.0 for cool conifer trees, grasses or woody desert plants.Globally averaged change in desert area predicted for each CMIP3 model simulation using the BIOME4 model a without and b with carbon dioxide fertilization. Each line represents a different model listed in color , and average of all models is in black, with diamonds., as described by are used for temperature changes, and the cloudiness is assumed not to change in the BIOME4 simulations using observations. in the National Center for Atmospheric Research NCAR Community Climate System Model CCSM3 . This 3-dimensional model simulates the source, transport and deposition of dust using 4 size bins, and has been compared to observations. For each source region, a separate tracer simulation is conducted for just that source region for one year, so that I can estimate where different sources dominate the deposition. The climate response of this model to various dust forcings is discussed by  In the global mean, the models predict drying of the desert regions due to warmer temperatures with an increase in greenhouse gases, as seen in the mean observations during the past 25 years. With no carbon dioxide fertilization in the BIOME4 model, this means an increase in desert regions globally Figure 1a , with a wide variation in the individual model predictions. If we take the median across the models instead of the mean, we obtain similar results not shown . If carbon dioxide fertilization is included in the simulations, this produces a decrease in desert area, as the higher carbon dioxide levels allow the plants to respond to the increased aridity more effectively Figure 1b . There is however, a wide spread in the predictions of different models, with the NCAR CCSM showing the greatest decrease in desert area in the future, and the GFDL and CSIRO models showing the biggest increase in desert in the future. The response of the CCSM3 in this study is similar to that shown by , The mean projected change in future desert area 2080–2100 is shown in Figure 3 for the case of no CO 2 fertilization or including CO 2 fertilization, respectively. In addition, it is useful to know whether the models agree or disagree on the change in deserts in any particular region—perhaps the response in that region is more robust. There is not strong consensus in the models about whether different desert regions will increase or decrease in size Figure 3 .Simulation of the fractional change in desert in each grid box 2.8 × 2.8 degree for the mean of the models for the case of a no CO 2 fertilization and b CO 2 fertilization. The number of models predicting an increase in desert area at each grid point c with no fertilization and b with fertilization. One of the important implications of changes in desert size is its impact on the downwind dust deposition. A source apportionment study from a model simulation shows generally which source areas will predominately impact which ocean deposition regions. Plotted are the annual averaged deposition fluxes Figure 4a and the source region with the largest deposition flux Figure 4b from the model simulations given by . However, realize that there is substantial variation between models in the predictions, and the mean of the models does not match the observationally-based predictions for 1940–1960.Current climate source apportionment. a Annual deposition fluxes from model, with boxes showing the source areas. b Different colors show regions dominated by the different source areas. In all cases, the source areas dominate the deposition in their own source areas. Asia is in purple, North America is in white, North Africa is in blue, Australia is in yellow, and South America is in green. Red is for both South Africa and Middle Eastern sources. and , , more similar to . In addition, the uncertainty in the magnitude of the carbon dioxide fertilization mechanism can change the sign in the predictions. Potential interactions between humans land use and desert dust source strength are neglected in this study, although they are likely to be important. In addition, desert area changes and especially desert dust itself may significantly change climate, and these impacts should be considered in future studies."
159,dust,"Summer dust aerosols detected from CALIPSO over the Tibetan Plateau. Summertime Tibetan dust aerosol plumes are detected from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations CALIPSO satellite. CALIPSO reveals that dust storms occur more frequently than previously found from Tibetan surface observations because few surface sites were available over remote northwestern Tibet due to high elevation and harsh climate. The Tibetan dust aerosol is characterized by column-averaged volume depolarization and total volume color ratios around 21% and 0.83, respectively. The dust layers appear most frequently around 4-7 km above mean sea level. The volume depolarization ratio for about 90% of the dust particles is less than 10% at low altitudes 3-5 km , while only about 50% of the particles have a greater depolarization ratio at higher altitudes 7-10 km . The 4-day back trajectory analyses show that these plumes probably originate from the nearby Taklamakan desert surface and accumulate over the northern slopes of the Tibetan Plateau. These dust outbreaks can affect the radiation balance of the atmosphere of Tibet because they both absorb and reflect solar radiation. Citation: Huang, J., P. Minnis, Y. Yi, Q. Tang, X. Wang, Y. Hu, Z. Liu, K. Ayers, C. Trepte, and D. Winker 2007 , Summer dust aerosols detected from CALIPSO over the Tibetan Plateau, Geophys. Res. Lett., 34, L18805, doi: 10.1029/ 2007GL029938. . They can also cause changes in cloud properties, such as the number concentration and size of cloud droplets, which can alter both cloud albedo and cloud lifetime. pointed out that, on intra-seasonal to inter-annual time scales, heating by absorbing aerosols may induce a tropospheric temperature anomaly over parts of northern India and Tibet in late spring and early summer, leading to an earlier onset and intensification of the Indian monsoon. They proposed the importance of atmospheric heating by an “elevated heat pump” effect due to dust transported from the nearby deserts to northern India stacking up against the southern slopes of the Himalayas. This dust combined with the black carbon from industrial and agricultural pollution in northern India provides an anomalous diabatic heat source that triggers positive feedback in monsoon convective heating, enhancing the Indian monsoon. These results suggest that aerosol effects on the monsoon water cycle dynamics are complex and likely to be a strong function of spatial and temporal scales. However, no convincing evidence of aerosol effect on monsoon climate variability has been noted due to the lack of observed dust aerosol over the Tibetan area., have focused on the late winter and spring due to observed long-range dust transport. There have been very few studies analyzing the specific signatures of summer and fall dust storms over the Tibetan Plateau. The recently launched CALIPSO satellite provides a wealth of actively sensed data over the region and provides an outstanding opportunity for studying Tibetan dust storms and their potential climatic effects. Unlike the previous generation of space-based remote sensing instruments, CALIPSO can observe aerosols over bright surfaces and beneath thin clouds as well as in clear sky conditions. This study investigates Tibetan dust characteristics and physical properties using CALIPSO data. The origins of Tibetan dust storms are also examined using the HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory HYSPLIT model http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ready/hysplit4.html .. The AAI has been used for a long time to remotely sense UV-absorbing aerosols, such as desert dust. The vertical distribution of dust plumes is one of the critical parameters in the assessment of dust radiative forcing. An analysis of observations by   Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of the AAI on 28 July as derived from AURA satellite measurements that were taken about 12 hours later than the CALIPSO data in Figure 1 . It is a semi-quantitative index of the columnar absorption by aerosols at 0.340 μ m. The signal is derived from the absorption of the upwelling Rayleigh scattering from the lower strata of the atmosphere. It can be seen in Figure 2 that the large AAI center is in the area surrounding the Taklamakan desert in Xinjiang. The Taklamakan desert area has a high frequency of dust storm occurrence, averaging more than 80 days each year. Dust aerosols from the Taklamakan Desert are entrained to an elevation of 5 km or higher and then transported over Tibet by the prevailing winds, which explains the structure seen in Figures 1 and 2 . The AAI exceeds 0.5 over most of the Tibet area and is with values greater than 1.0 over northern Tibet. These large values indicate that the aerosols are highly absorptive.Aura OMI aerosol index over Taklamkan Desert and Tibet Plateau on 28 July 2006. To investigate the dust aerosol origins, air mass trajectories were computed with the HYSPLIT model for the 10 cases listed in Table 1 . Back trajectories with starting points, based on the CALIPSO observation, were computed for a 4-day period. The starting points from the back trajectory analyses i.e., the end point of dust transport are marked with stars in Figure 4 . The horizontal trajectory curves show that the dust plumes observed over the Tibetan Plateau all originated from the Taklamakan Desert. However, the back trajectories show that the dust particles are not directly lofted to the Tibetan Plateau but that most transports occur around the anticyclonic pathway. The dust first moves eastward and then turns to the south around the edge of desert. After that the dust moves westward and accumulates over the northern slopes of the Tibetan Plateau where eventually it is lofted up over the plateau. This pathway may be related to the low thermal cyclone that occurs when dust storms are observed in the Taklamakan Desert.Four-day back trajectories of air parcels climbing upon the Tibet Plateau for the 10 cases listed in Table 1 . The gray dots represent surface observation station.[12]  This paper presents direct Tibetan dust aerosol measurements from CALIPSO observations during summer, a season that is typically inactive for the development of dust storms. The dust particles primarily originate from the nearby Taklamakan desert and accumulate over the northern slope of the Tibetan Plateau. Because surface stations are mainly located on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, no surface observations are available over the northwestern region due to high elevation and harsh climate. However, during summer most Tibetan dust plumes develop elsewhere and are transported over western Tibet and remain undetected from the surface. Thus, satellite remote sensing data are crucial for detecting the Tibetan dust plumes and for estimating the optical properties and radiative impacts of the particles. For example, CALIPSO detected approximately 48 Tibetan dust plumes from a total of 90 nighttime overpasses over Tibet for the period from 14 June to 30 September 2006. According to the CALIPSO observations, the frequency of occurrence of summer dust plumes over the region 25–45°N, 75–100°E under study is about 53%, which is much higher than results obtained from surface observations. The total averaged dust events floating-dust and blowing dust plus dust storm observed from the surface stations box region in Figure 4 is less than 10% for the 4-month period from June to September X. Wang, personal communication, 2007 . It is far less than the frequency detected by CALIPSO. Although the difference between CALIPSO and surface observations may be related to other factors, the CALIPSO measurements provide a wealth of previously unknown information. Of course, this study is only a first step in quantifying the effectiveness of CALISPO for identifying dust plumes over the Tibetan Plateau. Further research should be focused on a combination of CALIPSO measurements with other NASA A-Train satellite measurements. The NASA A-Train satellites can provide near-simultaneous measurements of aerosol optical and radiative properties, cloud and aerosol vertical structure, cloud properties, and water vapor profiles. By combining TOA fluxes from the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System CERES scanners and aerosol/cloud properties retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on Aqua with the vertical distributions of aerosols and clouds from CALIPSO, it should be possible to reliably determine dust aerosol radiative forcing over this remote area where heavy dust loadings occur much more frequently than expected."
160,dust aerosol,"A new Saharan dust source activation frequency map derived from MSG-SEVIRI IR-channels. We present a new dust source area map for the Sahara and Sahel region, derived from the spatiotemporal variability of composite images of Meteosat Second Generation MSG using the 8.7, 10.8 and 12.0 mm wavelength channels for March 2006-February 2007. Detected dust events have been compared to measured aerosol optical thickness AOT and horizontal visibility observations. Furthermore the monthly source area map has been compared with the Ozone Monitoring Instrument aerosol index AI . A spatial shift of the derived frequency patterns and the local maxima of AI-values can be explained by wind-transport of airborne dust implicitly included in the AI signal. To illustrate the sensitivity of a regional model using the new dust source mask, we present a case study analysis that shows an improvement in reproducing aerosol optical thickness in comparison to the original dust source parameterization. . Dust impacts the atmospheric radiation budget indirectly by influencing microphysical cloud processes and directly by scattering and absorbing shortwave radiation, and absorbing and re-emitting longwave radiation. Furthermore, dust deposition provides nutrients for oceanic microorganisms, ultimately influencing the CO 2 -cycle. The atmospheric dust distribution itself is influenced by climate parameters like wind fields and precipitation.. An adequate description of source areas is a prerequisite for estimates of the effects of dust aerosol, as well as for understanding the response of dust emissions to changing climate conditions., and since September 2004 from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument OMI . Regions of maximum AI or high frequency of high AI occurrences are widely used as a proxy for dust source areas. Recent applications in modeling the atmospheric dust cycle made use of the fact that the locations of maximum AI agree well with enclosed topographic depressions, and parameterize those as preferential dust sources. using measurements by Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor SeaWiFS and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS . Furthermore a daily noon-time Infrared Difference Dust Index IDDI derived from Meteosat 1 has been used to detect dust source areas. All of these indices that provide information about aerosol over land are available at daily time resolution and do not resolve sub-daily processes like the daily cycle of dust emission.. EUMETSAT offers a dust index product for MSG scenes on its website based on BT differences BTD http://www.eumetsat.int . The same BTD and composite picture configuration is used for dust detection in this work. It is composed of the BTD at 12.0. The source activation and the magnitudes of emission fluxes are computed by LM-MUSCAT with the use of LM surface winds at each 80 s time step. A simulation of the same period with the original model was used as reference case. In the reference case, dust emission fluxes depend on soil texture, surface roughness, and surface wind speeds and topographic depressions are parameterized as hot spots of dust emission. Compared to AERONET's AOT the use of the new source area map clearly improves the modeled AOT for both test cases compared to the reference case, both in AOT magnitude and timing of dust events Figure 3 . At the location of the AERONET station Saada the AOT results of Test case 1 show best agreement with the observations, while at the other stations Test case 2 performs best. Correlations between modeled and observed AOT show high correlation coefficients for the Test cases 1 and 2 ∣r∣ = 0.9 and lower ones for the reference case ∣r∣ = 0.7 .Comparison of modeled 550 nm and measured AOT 440 nm at AERONET stations for a Dakar, b Saada, c Cinzana and d Ilorin for March 4th–29th 2006 shown as Julian Days .[19]  These results using the new source area map as a mask for potential dust sources represent a first test; further refinements of the source formulation are needed. However, for this case study the implementation of the new derived dust source areas already show a promising improvement of the model performance.[20]  We used three thermal IR wavelength channels of the SEVIRI instrument on board the geostationary MSG satellite to detect the present atmospheric dust over land. The high spatiotemporal resolution makes the detection of individual dust emission events possible. Using this information we compiled a new monthly 1° × 1° DSAF map for the Sahara and Sahel region from MSG IR composite pictures for the March 2006–February 2007. The advantage of using measurements by a geostationary satellite is the improved detection of atmospheric dust close to its source due to the higher temporal resolution of the retrievals compared to daily retrievals from polar-orbiting instruments like OMI. In the presence of clouds, localization of dust emission is limited. Uncertainties in localization and misinterpretation of the MSG-signal are the main error sources. Results from the application of the DSAF map as a ‘mask’ to describe dust emission areas in a dust model indicate that this observation-based dust source distribution has the potential to improve the performance of regional scale Saharan dust transport models compared to earlier source area parameterizations.[21]  The MSG data set will be extended to include results for upcoming years, and additional case studies will be performed to test possible improvements in dust models from the use of the new source parameterization."
161,dust,"Numerical study of the atmospheric input of anthropogenic total nitrate to the marginal seas in the western North Pacific region. Atmospheric input of anthropogenic total nitrate to marginal seas in the western North Pacific region was simulated using a regional chemical transport model over East Asia based on year-to-year emission estimates during 1980-2003. Seasonal cycles and concentration levels of gas and aerosol were examined using observation data from various studies. The model simulated total nitrate deposition over the East China Sea ECS as 140 GgN/yr, which is the same order of the annual river discharge from the Yangtze River. The ratio of dry and wet deposition over ECS was obtained as approximately 6: 4. Total nitrate deposition over ECS corresponds to 3.2% N base of total NO x emission in China. The total deposition at present is three times larger than that of 1980, corresponding with increased NOx emissions.  also reported the importance of atmospheric supply of nitrate to the Yellow Sea YS . was used for deposition evaluation. The detailed configuration of CMAQ simulation with 80-km grid resolution has already been reported by . The NO x emission intensity combustion base only of REAS for 2000 was estimated as 11.2 Tg-NO 2 ·yr −1 for China 25.2 Tg-NO 2 for Asia , whereas the 3.81 Tg-NO 2 ·yr −1 for China 10.7 Tg-NO 2 ·yr −1 for Asia in 1980 indicated a 2.9-times increase in NO x emissions in China. Before analysis of deposition flux, we will confirm that the CMAQ results reproduce typical seasonal variation of O 3 , NO 2 , nitrate and total nitrate T-NO 3 over the ESC region through comparison with available observation data., in addition to those of two remote islands Okinawa and Fukue and a sub-rural site of Nagasaki city. The measurements are very limited. Therefore, we used the averaged concentration from R/V Hakuho-maru, even though the measurement year is different HK-02-3 is in 2002, HK-04-9 is in 2004 . Figure 2a compares the NO 2 tropospheric column density over the ECS region for 2002 based on GOME satellite retrieval and CMAQ results obtained using a method reported by   Figures 2c and 2d respectively show comparisons of nitrate NO 3 − and total-nitrate T-NO 3 . The thick black line shows CMAQ results for 2002; the stippled area shows the concentration range between the years of 2002 and 2004. Figure 2c shows a comparison of the nitrate measurements at Okinawa and Nagasaki, and a three-year-averaged value for Fukue Island. Figure 2d presents a comparison of the Okinawa Cape Hedo measurement by Osaka Prefectural University OPU , Nagasaki, and Fukue. The OPU measurement is NO y not total-nitrate ; however, NO x and PAN concentrations are low at remote sites of Okinawa Cape Hedo , so NO y mainly represents the total-nitrate. Details of observation methods are available at EANET http://www.eanet.cc/ , Nagasaki, and for Cape Hedo by OPU Y.

In Figure 2e , the stippled area represents the range of total nitrate deposition for 2002–2004. Figure 3 shows the horizontal distribution of the annually averaged atmospheric T-NO 3 concentration μ g/m 3 at the model first vertical layer z = 75 m and NO 3 deposition amount kg-N/km 2 /yr for the year 2002. Figure 4 displays the annual changes of NO 3 deposition flux over the selected regions ECS, YS, SJ, and Japan islands , and NO x emission amounts in China and Japan during 1980–2003 from the REAS emission inventory. a Annual averaged distribution of total nitrate HNO 3 + NO 3 − at CMAQ first vertical layer 1 z = 75 m ; b distribution of annual deposition amount of total nitrate HNO 3 + NO 3 − .Evolution of Chinese NO x emissions right axis and annual deposition amount of total nitrate left axis in each ocean region and the Japan islands during 1980–2003. Seasonal variation of the deposition flux over ECS is interesting see Figure 2e . Dry deposition flux of HNO 3 is 0.1–0.3 Gg NO 3 -N/day/region, showing no clear seasonal cycle. The lower dry deposition of nitrate depends on the specification of dry deposition velocity in CMAQ, which is discussed later in this section. Wet deposition of nitrate shows the correlation with precipitation and ranges mainly 0.05–0.4 annual mean of 0.21 Gg NO 3 -N/day/region. It shows the summer minimum even if precipitation is higher because the atmospheric concentration of nitrate is low as a result of coverage of the ECS by a clean Pacific High air mass summer monsoon . The overall total nitrate deposition flux shows higher values between January and May and lower values in July and August. During fall and winter monsoons, it shows a sawtooth-like change, which depends on the frequency of outbreak of pollutants from the Asian continent to ECS and precipitation events. Changing the dry deposition velocity from 0.1 cm/s to 0.2 cm/s will reduce 1% of the surface concentration within 1 h, assuming a mixing depth of 500 m. This amount might be small when considering the turbulent mixing of the atmosphere. In light of that amount, the simplest correction is merely increasing the nitrate dry deposition amount to two times larger as an upper bound value. Based on this correction, the total nitrate deposition amount over ECS is 140 GgN/yr. Consequently, the total deposition over the YS, SJ, and the Japan islands will be increased respectively by approximately 11%, 5%, and 4% from the baseline values. stated the NO 3 /NH 4 ratio in the Yangtze River as 430/190 GgN . Based on that ratio, the river discharge of NO 3 including NO 2 by Chen and Wang   Zhang and Lui of NO y deposition for the East China Sea, whereas our estimate is 220 mgN/m 2 /yr. Our result is within the range of their average. These equations indicate that the N deposition amounts of ECS and YS respectively correspond to 3.2% and 2.1% of Chinese NO x emissions. Over SJ, those emissions are 1.79 times greater than those of 1980; the equation is given as [23]  The deposition amount is approximately 1.9% of Chinese NO x emissions. The regression coefficients differ because of the different area sizes and distances from major emission source regions. Increased deposition amounts depend both on increased emissions and inter-annual variability of meteorology. It is important to point out that the high correlation coefficient suggests that the nitrate deposition over these regions will increase almost linearly with Chinese NO x development.[24]  The present study indicates that the atmospheric input of anthropogenic total nitrate to marginal seas in the western North Pacific regions increased intensively 1.8–4.2 times during a recent 24-year period 1980–2003 . The model simulated total NO 3 -N deposition over ECS in 2002 of 140 GgN/yr; the ratio of dry and wet deposition was approximately 6: 4. That total value is of the same order as the annual river discharge from the Yangtze River. The ratio to river discharge might vary because the river flow is now controlled by the Three Gorges Dam, and requires further study. Total NO 3 deposition over ECS corresponds to 3.2% N base of the total NO x emission in China. Atmospheric influx distributes into the wide area of marginal seas of the Asian continent with low concentration . It can reach the open ocean where the nutrient concentration is low and has a sporadic influx because of precipitation events, which might be important for the open ocean ecosystem."
162,aerosol ocean,"Preferential settling of elongated mineral dust particles in the atmosphere. Positions of particles' centers of gravity and folding centers were analyzed for individual dust particles in snow on a high mountain in Japan. Bias of dust particles' centers of gravity was observed: L1 the longest distance from the center of gravity to the boundary of particles is 5% of L1, on average longer than L2 1/ 2 of the longest axis of particles , suggesting that a preferential orientation exists for particles settling heavy side down. Applying that preferential orientation of settling particles to Ginoux's model, the settling velocity for ellipsoids with Reynolds numbers lower than 2 was estimated. The results show that, for long- range transport particles, settling velocity of spherical particles is lower than that of ellipsoids with equal surface area. Our results also indicate that, away from the source regions, dust particles are essentially spherical, which considerably simplify the calculation of settling velocity in transport and of radiative transfer models.  and the geochemical cycle of atmospheric constituents. For precedent global atmospheric transport models of mineral dust particles, dust particles have usually been assumed as sphere. However, many studies have shown that nonsphericity of dust particles strongly affects mineral dusts' optical and aerodynamic properties. Therefore, nonsphericity of mineral dusts must be well characterized for application to various optical and transport models. studied the motion of nonspherical particles in a turbulent flow. . The size of those dust particles in the atmosphere was primarily in the range of <10 μ m where an increased settling for elongated ellipsoids can be found and preferential settling of elongated ellipsoids is active./ u ∞ λ = 1 }. For example, the settling velocity of particles of 2 μ m diameter increases respectively around 50%, 100%, and 165% for aspect ratios of 2, 4, and 10. The relative difference decreases with increasing particle size. For particles of 10 μ m, the settling velocity increase for ellipsoids is around 30–40%, with little difference shown for aspect ratios of 1–10. On the other hand, a 40% decrease of settling velocity for ellipsoids is apparent at around 40–50 μ m for the aspect ratio of 10.Relative difference of calculated settling velocity between spherical and ellipsoidal particles, calculated as Δ u ∞ = 100% × who also noticed an increased settling velocity for particles settling along their polar axis for aspect ratios of less than 4. As shown in Figures 3 and 4 , elongated particles smaller than 11 μ m will deposit faster than spherical particles with equal surface area.. During long-range transport in the atmosphere, ellipsoidal elongated particles would settle faster than spherical particles with equal surface area. At receptor downwind areas such as Japan, the proportion of nearly spherical dust particles would be higher than that in source areas such as the Chinese desert areas, as observed by Li and Osada [2007] . The essentially nearly spherical dust particles observed at downwind area after long-range transport could also suggest that, except over dust sources, it is valid to assume spherical particles for transport model and radiative calculation.[17]  The positions of particles' centers of gravity and the folding centers were analyzed for dust particles in snow from a high mountain in Japan. Measurement results showed that the centers of gravity of dust particles are very likely biased to one side of the longest axis. The difference between L1 the longest distance from the center of gravity to the boundary of particles and L2 1/2 of the longest axis of particles was 5% on average, 0% minimum, and 24% maximum. The bias of the center of gravity might lead to a preferential orientation for settling particles as heavy side down. Applying the preferential orientation of settling particles to the Ginoux's model, settling velocity for ellipsoidal particles at Reynolds number lower than 2 was estimated as a function of the aspect ratio.[18]  The calculation results for particles smaller than 11 μ m showed that 1 the settling velocity of spherical particles is lower than that of ellipsoids, and 2 the settling velocity increases with increasing aspect ratio. The relative differences of settling velocity of ellipsoidal to spherical particles were positive and high for 2 μ m particles, but decreased to negative values for particles larger than 20 μ m. Therefore, elongated particles smaller than 11 μ m will be deposited faster than spherical particles with equal surface area. The preferential settling of elongated particles leads to an increased proportion of nearly spherical particles after long range transport in the atmosphere, as observed in Li and Osada [2007] . Our results also indicate that, away from dust sources, it is valid to assume spherical particles for gravitational settling in transport model and for radiative calculation in transfer radiative model."
163,dust particles aerosol,"Potential climatic effects of meteoric smoke in the Earth's paleo-atmosphere. Modelling of the growth of meteoric smoke in the Earth's atmosphere, by assuming the formation of either simple spherical compact particles or, more realistically, fractal porous aggregates, highlights important differences in the predicted atmospheric size distributions as a function of altitude. The calculated UV extinction and direct radiative forcing DRF of these types of particles is also quite different. It is shown that, with regard to a , forming a UV barrier before the presence of significant ozone levels in the atmosphere and b , triggering 'snowball Earth' glaciations by negative DRF, fractal smoke particles are unlikely to have been important even if the flux of interplanetary dust into the atmosphere was 3 orders of magnitude higher than the present day. However, if these particles are effective ice nuclei, then subsequent indirect forcing through ice cloud formation could have made a more significant contribution to the onset of ancient glaciation episodes. . To date, modelling studies of the vertical distribution of these smoke particles in the atmosphere have assumed they are spherical in shape and compact in structure.. This type of particle, as is likely the case with meteoric smoke, originates from the condensation of metal oxides and silicates. Secondly, the characteristics of a scattering layer which was observed by lidar to descend through the stratosphere were best explained in terms of non-spherical particles of meteoric composition. Finally, we have recently conducted a laboratory study to generate analogues of meteoric smoke in a photo-chemical flow reactor. These experiments produced extended particle aggregates with amorphous, porous structures and mineral compositions such as hematite Fe 2 O 3 and fayalite Fe 2 SiO 4 . Modelling of the growth kinetics of these particles showed that the rates of aggregation were enhanced by long-range inter-particle magnetic dipole interactions, which are most likely also responsible for the extended structures... The mechanism originally suggested for the onset of these widespread glaciations is the drawdown of CO 2 from the atmosphere due to ‘super-continent’ break-up. More recently, a study by , and were used for all model runs.. This work found that, per gram of meteoritic material, fluffy non-spherical particles were more efficient condensation nuclei compared with compact spherical particles. However, their nucleating efficiency has not been studied under realistic upper atmospheric conditions, in spite of the fact that they have long been proposed as condensation nuclei for NLCs in the upper mesosphere. and hence ice cloud formation could have lead to a significant increase in albedo. We note that the predicted height-resolved particle concentrations Figure 1b in the mesosphere are significantly higher e.g. by ∼2 orders of magnitude at 60 km for ×100 PDF when fractal growth occurs. The ice nucleation potential for meteoric smoke is likely to be enhanced in the case of porous fractal aggregates due to their larger surface area-to-volume ratios in comparison with volume-equivalent spherical, compact particles. Hence, this potential is likely to be greater at high IDP fluxes which result in higher concentrations of such larger extended particle aggregates. In addition, meteoric smoke could also exert an indirect effect in the lower atmosphere. The particles are thought to be transported via meridional circulation in the mesosphere to the winter pole, and then descend into the lower stratosphere inside the polar vortex, where they may impact on polar stratospheric cloud formation. The particles probably then enter the troposphere through mid-latitude tropopause folding. If the IDP flux were large enough, then smoke particles could increase the ice nucleus population, promoting increased cirrus cloud formation and modifying cloud optical properties, thus leading to an increase in the indirect forcing contribution.[21]  Our model of meteoric smoke formation, growth and vertical transport shows that particle concentrations at larger sizes are enhanced in the middle atmosphere when the particles have a fractal porous structure compared with spherical compact particles. One consequence of this is that the optical extinction ratio UVB: visible is predicted to be less than 2.0 for IDP fluxes from present day levels 44 t d −1 up to 3 orders of magnitude above this level for realistic particle porosity values P < 0.9 . This trend indicates that any possible role for meteoric smoke as a UV barrier in the Earth's paleo-atmosphere is significantly reduced when non-spherical particle growth is accounted for. Even during periods of elevated IDP flux to the atmosphere, likely to have occurred in the Earth's past, we find that the direct radiative forcing due to fractal smoke particles would be much lower in comparison with that from spherical particles, and would be insufficient to have triggered snowball Earth glaciations."
164,dust climate aerosol,"Temporal controls on global dust emissions: The role of surface gustiness. Topographic depressions serve as the key spatial control on large global dust sources. In contrast, the temporal control on these hotspots has remained elusive. We provide the first global observational evidence that the annual cycle of emissions from dust hotspots is determined by an erosivity feature in the form of wind gustiness. We use TOMS AI and an aridity index to define 131 global dust hotspots. The correlation between the annual cycle of hotspot dust and the annual cycle of gustiness is 70% stronger than the corresponding correlation with wind. The mean significant correlation with wind n = 106 hotspots is 0.37 sigma = 0.24 and the mean of significant correlation n = 118 hotspots with gustiness is 0.63 sigma = 0.12 . Whereas most model simulations of dust have relied on the broadscale wind, gustiness holds overwhelmingly more power in explaining the annual cycle of dust emissions from global dust hotspots. , and influencing biogeochemical cycles and cloud characteristics. Dust also has an impact on human health. Owing to its impact on the Earth's energy budget, the inclusion of dust in climate models is clearly vital for the realistic simulation of past, present and future climates. If dust emission is not well simulated, all subsequent processes involving dust in the atmosphere will not be realistic either. While climatically important atmospheric gases such as CO 2 are well mixed in the atmosphere, constituents like mineral dust, which account for about 75% of the global aerosol mass load and 25% of the global aerosol optical depth, have a short residence time, seldom longer than two weeks. Representing the dust cycle in modeling efforts therefore requires precise spatial and temporal simulation of dust emissions so that the impacts of dust on climate can be treated in realistic locations and at appropriate times in the annual cycle.. Based on the observation that peaks in the spatial distribution of the long-term mean TOMS AI coincide with the geographic distribution of topographic depressions, it has been argued that increased sediment accumulation characterizes the depressions. These sediments are often the relicts of now desiccated Holocene lakes, which have an increased potential for deflation given a low or non-existent vegetation cover. Dust models, adopting preferred source regions on the basis of topographic depressions in regions with low vegetation, showed a greatly improved simulation of atmospheric dust loadings and transport. The temporal controls on variability, particularly in hyper arid locations where the majority of mineral dust originates, have in contrast remained poorly understood., a process which mainly depends on surface roughness, particle size, soil moisture and wind characteristics. Although changes in soil moisture and vegetation cover affect the annual cycle of dust emission in some deserts, changes in the surface winds are the more important control on emissions in hyper-arid deserts which dominate dust production and where vegetation cover does not change significantly over the year.. The satellite derived index which is based on the spectral difference between two UV channels 340 nm and 380 nm for the Nimbus 7 satellite which flew from November 1978 to May 1993, can be used as an indicator for the amount of dust suspended in the atmosphere. Although it has been suggested that the applied algorithm may not be able to detect dust at low levels close to the ground, it provides one of the longest continuous records. We here use TOMS AI data version 8 available on a 1.25° longitude by 1° latitude grid from January 1984 to December 1990 when the TOMS AI was most stable and not affected by volcanic aerosols. Surface wind gustiness parameters were derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF 40 year Re-Analysis ERA-40 fields of 10 m surface wind speed and 10 m surface gustiness interpolated to local noon to match the TOMS AI sampling time for 1984 to 1990. The temporal interpolation to local noon was achieved as the weighted mean of the two corresponding grid boxes in the two ERA-40 files which temporally cover local noon at the specific longitude, with weights determined by the distance of the grid box from the two respective longitudes represented by the time UTC of the ERA-40 files. In ERA-40, surface gustiness is a parameterized field which is thought to be comparable with gustiness measurements defined by the World Meteorological Organization WMO as the maximum wind averaged over 3 second intervals. The gustiness field is available as a 6-hour model forecast field since wind departing from the broad-scale flow is generally excluded in the assimilation process. Both wind datasets were regridded to 1.25° longitude by 1° latitude in order to match the TOMS AI spatial resolution. We identify 131 hotspots of dust emission using the method described in the previous section Figure 1 . Most of the identified hotspots are located in areas known to be dust source regions, and many coincide with point sources e.g. playas, dry lakes or wadis as described in the literature. Dust hotspots are found on all continents except Antarctica. With 78% n = 102 hotspots of the identified dust hotspots north of the equator, emissions predominate in the northern hemisphere between the equator and about 45°N, including desert regions of North America, North Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The other 22% n = 29 hotspots are located in the southern hemisphere in dry regions of South America, southern Africa and Australia between 15°S and 45°S. The global average arithmetic mean TOMS AI for the hotspots is 1.22 with a maximum of 3.29 Figure 2 . Highest average emissions occur in North Africa 1.63 followed by the Middle East 1.24 . Lower average emissions occur in Asia 0.9 , South Africa 0.88 , South America 0.81 and Australia 0.78 , and lowest emissions occur in North America 0.72 .Long-term mean TOMS AI values and their variability derived from 131 dust hotspots as defined in Figure 1 for specific geographic regions. The arithmetic mean is represented by the asterisk. The horizontal line through the box represents the median, the lower edge of the box the 25%-percentile and the upper edge the 75%-percentile. The horizontal lines below and above the box represent the minimum and maximum value. The number of hot spots is given above each box. Surface gustiness dominates over surface winds in the correlation with dust over the annual cycle such that 88 of the 101 or 87% statistically significant p = 0.05 dust hot spots show a stronger correlation between gustiness and TOMS AI than between wind speed and TOMS AI Figure 3 . The mean of significant r s,wind correlations n = 106 hotspots is 0.37 σ = 0.24 and the mean of significant r s,gust correlations n = 118 hotspots is 0.63 σ = 0.12 . This represents an increase in the mean correlation coefficients of 70%.. As the WMO requires SYNOP stations to be located in open terrain in order to be well exposed to wind, the ERA-40 10 m surface wind field is computed using the concept of exposure correction whereby the surface roughness length has a value of 0.03 m representing grassland for all grid boxes where roughness is greater than 0.03 m. For dust models which use the ERA-40 10 m surface wind field to calculate emissions, the exposure correction introduces a potential error as the wind speed and variability may not accurately represent real-world conditions in some regions where the roughness is an important factor in determining those wind characteristics.. However, the wind variability used to estimate gustiness is based on 10 m surface wind speeds computed without exposure correction. Therefore, wind variability here is likely to be higher over inhomogeneous terrain compared to the 10 m surface wind field computed including the exposure correction. The observed difference in the relationship between the annual cycle of TOMS AI and wind r s,wind and TOMS AI and gustiness r s,gust Figure 3 may therefore result from the different ways in which surface winds are computed for the 10 m surface wind speed field exposure correction and 10 m surface gustiness field no exposure correction . A key explanation for the enhanced explanatory power of gustiness must therefore rest with the way ERA-40 parameterizes surface gustiness, assuming that ERA-40 does not simulate the gustiness events which actually occur in the real world. Wind observations used in the assimilation process are extremely sparsely distributed in the regions of almost all of the 131 dust hotspots and the gustiness component in the observed wind field, where such data are present, is invariably excluded during assimilation. From this perspective it is very surprising that gustiness performs so much better than the mean wind, particularly given the cubic dependence of emissions on surface wind speed which acts to amplify any errors resulting from a parameterization process. Dust emission has nevertheless been shown to occur as a result of scales well below that of climate models. The suggestion here is that the gustiness parameterization represents wind characteristics which are closer to these smaller scales and are capable of being representative even in coarse spatial scale models. The results here strongly suggest that the use of the gustiness parameter as a driver of emissions in dust models may well improve model performance.[21]  Using the satellite derived TOMS AI and ECMWF ERA-40 reanalysis fields of 10 m surface wind speed and 10 m surface gustiness, we show that for 131 global dust hotspots identified from the long-term mean TOMS AI, surface gustiness exerts a much stronger temporal control on the timing of emissions than the broadscale winds. The results highlight the importance of localized high wind events such as gusts as a driver of dust emissions from the Earth's deserts.[22]  Long-term measurements of high resolution wind characteristics and atmospheric dust in source regions are needed to verify and quantify the observed relationship between dust emission and gustiness on the ground. A future study will look into the possibility of whether the ECMWF ERA-40 gustiness parameter can be implemented in global dust models and whether this will improve model simulations of the global dust cycle."
165,clouds aerosol,"Incursions and radiative impact of Asian dust in northern Alaska. The Arctic region is sensitive to incursions of aerosols that affect its radiation balance, directly through interactions with solar and terrestrial radiation and indirectly as cloud condensation nuclei. During spring 2002 dust was transported from the Gobi desert passing over instrumented field sites near Barrow, Alaska, providing the opportunity to measure the dust properties. Empirical determinations of the direct radiative forcing by dust were used to corroborate simulations made using the Moderate Resolution Transmittance radiative transfer code, MODTRAN TM 5. During sunlit periods, dust cools the surface while warming those layers in which it resides, increasing atmospheric stability. At night, dust layers tend to cool while the surface warms slightly due to infrared emissions from the dust layer. . The climate impacts of aerosols depend on the frequency, intensity and spatial extent of their distributions, as well as their chemical, physical and optical properties. The timing and location of an incursion is critical because solar geometry and surface albedo influence the magnitude and possibly the sign of the forcing. To complicate matters, aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei, affecting cloud microphysical processes, resulting in further modulation of the radiation balance.. Often, the aerosol is a mixture of dust and anthropogenic pollutants. The radiative impacts of Arctic aerosols have previously been evaluated using radiative transfer models. Lacking the necessary data, however, simulations have rarely been corroborated empirically. During early April 2002, Gobi desert dust was transported by upper-level winds to northern Alaska. Plumes were tracked from their origin using back trajectories and satellite imagery. Transit time was estimated to be about eight days. Figure 1 presents time series of parameters that vary with the opacity of the dust layers. Spectral aerosol optical depth AOD λ and particle scattering coefficients σ sp λ quantify the aerosol loading within the atmosphere and at the surface, respectively. The Ångström exponent Å is often used as an indicator of mean particle size. Values of Å are derived from wavelength pairs of the NOAA sunphotometer Figure 1b and nephelometer Figure 1d . The dust is first observed over Barrow on day of year DOY 95 and reaches its peak concentration on DOY 103 when AOD 500 exceeds 0.35 Figure 1a . Correlated peaks in AOD and scattering correspond to dips in Å that indicate higher concentrations of super-micron sized particles. Thus, during the most turbid periods, the dust layers contained coarse mode particles that attenuate sunlight quite efficiently.Time series for early April 2002 of observations made near Barrow, Alaska, of a AOD λ derived from a four-channel sunphotometer wavelengths are color-coded according to the legend , b corresponding Ångström exponents Å for the 412/675 nm pair of wavelengths, c light scattering coefficients at 550 nm for particle diameters < 10 micron green and submicron red , and d Å for the 550/700 nephelometer pair of wavelengths. Blue circles indicate periods when Å dips significantly below the long-term median value. In each panel, dashed lines represent typical clean background values.. To compare modeled with observed fluxes, ω o and g must be prescribed for each spectral interval over the range 0.28–3.0 μ m. These are determined in two steps: 1 inferring the particle size distribution of dust by inverting measurements of AOD λ , and 2 running a Mie code, MIEV, to derive optical properties that are required to initialize radiative transfer calculations.; m ≈ 1.51 − i 0.007, approximately weighed by the solar spectrum. The imaginary part was then increased to i 0.009 to account for absorption by carbonaceous particles that may have been incorporated in the plume during transport. Although a prescribed value of m = 1.51 − i 0.009 is greater than a number of historical measurements, it is closer to the value derived for the “yellow sands” sometimes observed over Japan.. During the event dust was obviously mixed to the surface where its optical properties were measured Figures 1c and 1d . The discrepancies between values of ω o 550 and g 550 derived using the Mie code versus in situ measurements are attributed to the choice of refractive index, the validity of which is addressed in the following section.. We define DARF as the change in net shortwave SW irradiance, NET sw = SW down − SW up , per unit change in AOD 500 , where SW down and SW up are the downwelling and upwelling broadband surface fluxes, respectively. The objective is to compare model results with those derived from measurements. If closure is achieved, the model can be used to derive heating rate profiles. Empirical determinations of DARF are subject to error depending on uncertainties in measured irradiance and AOD 500 . Random errors in measurements of SW down and SW up are ≤5 Wm −2 . Derived values of NET sw , and surface albedo, α = SW up / SW down , are subject to corresponding uncertainties.. Ozone corrections were applied on the basis of retrievals from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/ozone/ozone_v8.html ; thus, AOD 500 data used for this analysis are considered accurate to within ±0.005. Uncertainties in DARF derived from measurements are estimated from regression statistics and range from 10% to 20%, largest for low solar elevation angles when irradiance measurements are subject to large relative errors.. A spectral albedo model for snow, adapted from Wiscombe and Warren  Overall, the agreement between modeled and observed values of DARF is fair considering the limited data set. All relationships are linear and show similar functionality with zenith angle. Modeled DARF is about 22% less than measured at θ o = 62° but is about 17% greater at θ o = 81°. Having achieved closure, MODTRAN™5 was next utilized to evaluate perturbations in heating rate profiles in response to varying dust concentrations Figure 3 . While the surface tends to cool, heating occurs within the dust layer itself. For example, during mid April dust having AOD 500 = 0.40 will increase solar heating within the layer by about 2 K/day while at the surface there is a net loss of ≈ 12 Wm −2 when θ o = 75°. The imbalance increases the stability of the lower atmosphere which in turn can suppress cloud formation. Layer heating and thus atmospheric stability tends to increase with increasing concentrations of dust. The potential for different types of aerosols to suppress cloud formation in the Arctic is an indirect radiative effect that requires further investigation.Modeled perturbations to solar solid and full spectral dotted and dashed atmospheric heating rates caused by a dust layer between 2 and 4 km altitude. The profiles represent the difference between a dust-laden atmosphere having varying AOD 500 and a dust-free atmosphere. All daytime simulations are for θ o = 75°. Full spectral 0.28–50.0 μ m results are plotted only for the case in which AOD 500 = 0.40, where the dotted and dashed curves relate to day and night simulations, respectively.. The LW optical properties were scaled to assure spectral continuity with the previously determined value at 3.0 μ m. A full spectral run was made to compare with a solar simulation, assuming AOD 500 = 0.40 and θ o = 75°, and another made for nighttime when only thermal forcing occurs. Results are shown in Figure 3 as dotted and dashed curves, respectively. During the day, layer heating is diminished by LW cooling by ≈ 0.1 K/day; cooling at the surface is diminished slightly. At night, there is slight cooling within, and warming below the layer caused by thermal emissions. In reality, thermal exchanges will depend not only on the emissivities of the dust and surface but also on their respective temperatures, which vary with ambient conditions. Certainly, solar forcing dominates during daylight hours. Our results must be viewed with caution, however. All computations are instantaneous evaluations, while in reality radiative forcing by aerosols varies significantly with solar geometry and with surface albedo. Solar forcing decreases with increasing zenith angle, to zero during dark periods, while thermal effects are continuous, varying instead with atmospheric and surface emissivity and thermal structure. The stability of the atmosphere may vary significantly from day to night in response to competing solar and thermal effects, influenced by the presence of aerosols. For the AOD 500 = 0.4 example described above, net loss of solar radiation is ≈ 8.0 Wm −2 when DARF is averaged over 24 hours, compared with approximately 12 Wm −2 during the daylight hours. In the context of climate change, DARF will vary greatly over seasons and from one location to another depending on aerosol concentration and distribution. Incursions of Asian dust will episodically cool the surface at high northern latitudes, representing a negative feedback to greenhouse warming. and/or nucleate ice particles; both processes that increase cloud albedo. Aerosols can also enhance cloud emissivity and thus their thermal emissions. At high latitudes, clouds tend to warm the surface when/where surface albedo is high, especially during the dark period, but tend to cool the surface in late summer when decreased snow and ice cover reduce surface albedo. Thus, indirect aerosol effects involving clouds not addressed here may exceed direct effects, producing negative or positive climate feedbacks depending on solar geometry, latitude and time of year.[21]  Accurate assessments of the climate impact of aerosols in polar regions must account for these very complicated interactions and feedbacks. As demonstrated above, careful analysis of observational data in conjunction with modeling provides a viable means to quantify the direct radiative forcing by aerosols, a first and important step towards improving the parameterization of such processes in global climate models."
166,particles,"Impacts of Saharan dust as CCN on the evolution of an idealized tropical cyclone. The impact of dust in the Saharan Air Layer SAL acting as cloud condensation nuclei CCN on the evolution of a tropical cyclone TC was examined by conducting simulations initialized with an idealized pre-TC mesoscale convective vortex MCV using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System RAMS . Increasing the background CCN concentration from 100 to 1000 and 2000 cm -3 in a layer between 1 and 5 km led to increases in averaged cloud droplet number concentration, and decreases in cloud droplet mean mass diameter through the entire simulation except during the initial spin-up. Dust in the SAL as CCN influenced the TC development by inducing changes in the hydrometeor properties, modifying the storm diabatic heating distribution and thermodynamic structure, and ultimately influencing the TC intensity through complex dynamical responses. The simulated storm intensities differed by up to 22 hPa depending on CCN concentration. The impact of CCN on storm intensity was sensitive to the background giant CCN GCCN vertical profile and presumably other environmental factors. The physical processes responsible for the impact of dust as nucleating aerosols on TC development need to be examined in the future under a wide range of environmental conditions. . Hurricane Cindy 1999 , Floyd 1999 , Debby 2000 , Joyce 2000 , Felix 2001 and Erin 2001 are such examples. Dunion and Velden . Dust can directly impact the radiative balance of the earth by absorbing and scattering sunlight. Dust, especially those coated with sulfur and other soluble materials, can also affect the cloud development by acting as cloud condensation nuclei CCN , giant CCN GCCN and ice nuclei IN . Analysis of visible satellite imagery over the east Atlantic shows that the dust in the SAL can be drawn into nearby mesoscale convective systems, which can later develop into TCs. Hurricane Erin 2001 was one example. Although previous studies have shown that large numbers of dust particles can impact the development of shallow convective clouds, the role of CCN on the development of highly organized, strong convective systems such as TCs has not been thoroughly investigated. This study will examine the impact of dust acting as CCN on the initiation and evolution of a TC using numerical simulations.. The simulations were initialized with the pressure, temperature and wind fields of an axisymmetric MCV consistent with observations obtained from several pre-TC MCVs. Three nested domains with horizontal resolutions of 24, 6 and 2 km were used. The numbers of horizontal grid points for Domain 1, Domain 2 and Domain 3 were 80 × 80, 102 × 102 and 152 × 152, respectively. There were 40 unevenly spaced vertical levels extending from the surface to 30 km with a minimum grid spacing near the surface of 300 m and a maximum vertical grid spacing of 1 km at higher altitudes. The Rayleigh friction absorbing layer extended from 20 km to 30 km. A sufficient depth of the Rayleigh friction absorbing layer and refined vertical resolution especially at higher altitudes are necessary to damp gravity waves so that they are not reflected downward as they can significantly affect the simulated storm intensity. The vortex was allowed to grow for 3 days in a zero wind environment over the ocean with a constant sea surface temperature SST of 29°C. Pre-TC MCVs are usually found on the southern edge of the SAL, which is a transient zone with hot and dry SAL air to the north and warm moist marine air to the south. Intrusion of dry air from the SAL into the convective systems could limit the impact of dust as nucleating aerosols. However, introducing this horizontal temperature gradient would require constructing an environmental wind field that satisfies the thermal wind balance and hence bring the impact of large scale wind shear into the simulations. Thus, to focus on the impacts of dust in the SAL acting as CCN, a horizontally uniform Jordan sounding, which is likely a composite of soundings from both the SAL and non-SAL environments, was used. described the extension of that scheme to include two modes of droplets and explicit activation of CCN and GCCN. The initial CCN distribution was horizontally homogeneous. Results from three sensitivity tests with different CCN vertical profiles representing clean, polluted and highly polluted scenarios are presented in detail. The clean simulation hereafter “Clean” was initialized with a constant CCN concentration of 100 cm −3 from the surface to 25 km. Dust particles were assumed to reside in a layer between 1 and 5 km. To represent elevated dust particles in the SAL, the polluted simulation hereafter “Polluted” was initialized with a CCN concentration of 1000 cm −3 between 1 km and 5 km. The double polluted simulation hereafter “Double” was initialized with a CCN concentration of 2000 cm −3 in the same layer. Since no direct measurement of a vertical profile of CCN over the ocean in the SAL was available, the CCN concentrations in “Polluted” were chosen based upon previous measurements in the dust plume. The CCN concentrations at the surface and above 5 km in “Polluted” and “Double” were 100 cm −3 , by which a clean marine air layer was assumed to undercut the SAL. The CCN were further assumed to be mostly hydrophobic with a water solubility of 10% to represent desert dust particles coated with sulfate. The percentage of CCN activated during a time step depends upon temperature, vertical velocity, CCN median radius and number concentration. During the course of the simulation, CCN are advected, diffused, depleted through nucleation scavenging, and replenished through droplet evaporation.. The background GCCN concentration decreased from a maximum of 0.5 cm −3 at the surface to 0.08 cm −3 at 5 km and then reduced to zero at higher altitudes. To examine if the trends observed in the “Clean”, “Polluted” and “Double” are valid in general, an additional set of three simulations was performed using CCN concentrations that were identical to those described in “Clean”, “Polluted” and “Double”, but initialized with a different background GCCN profile. The GCCN profile had the same maximum value of 0.5 cm −3 at surface but was reduced to 0.01 cm −3 instead of 0.08 cm −3 at 5 km. Similarities and differences between both series of simulations are presented. The activated CCN number determines the number of cloud droplets formed through heterogeneous nucleation. The evolution of the total cloud droplet number closely followed the trend of total number of activated CCN with correlations of 0.91, 0.81 and 0.85 for “Clean”, “Polluted” and “Double”. Averaged over the last 60 hours, N c for “Clean”, “Polluted” and “Double” were 22.6, 37.5 and 57.5 cm −3 , respectively Figure 1c . “Clean” had larger cloud droplets with an average D m of 36.2 μ m compared to 33.7 and 30.6 μ m for “Polluted” and “Double” Figure 1d . The averaged q c did not show a clear monotonic trend of increasing or decreasing with increasing CCN as did N c and D m until 46 hr Figure 1e . The q c may be significantly affected by factors such as updraft intensity, horizontal wind speed and moisture supply associated with the storm dynamics other than CCN concentration. Overall, Figure 1 shows that increasing the background CCN led to increases in V ccn , N ccn , N c , and a decrease in D m . The trends persisted through the entire simulation except during the initial spin-up.. Variations of diabatic heating rate distribution between simulations were observed as early as this initial VHTs forming stage. Figures 4a, 4c, and 4e show the azimuthally averaged diabatic heating rate at 9 hr for the three simulations. The diabatic heating in “Clean” was concentrated between 40 km to 60 km in the radial direction with an area having the maximum heating rates greater than 35 K hr −1 at 7.5 km above sea level. “Polluted” and “Double” showed less organized, less intense diabatic heating distributed over a broader radial distance with maximum heating rates not exceeding 20 K hr −1 , which is likely to be a result of azimuthally averaging since the diabatic heating in “Polluted” and “Double” showed less axisymmetry compared to “Clean” at this time. The total heating induced by the VHTs accumulated during the first 24 hours was not large enough to raise the temperature at the center of the vortex. Therefore the MSLP of all three simulated storms did not decrease Figure 2 .Temporal evolutions of the MSLP and maximum surface wind for “Clean”, “Polluted” and “Double”. Line types are the same as described in Figure 1 .Surface Z at left 9 hr, middle 60 hr, and right 70 hr for top “Clean”, middle “Polluted” and bottom “Double”.Azimuthally averaged diabatic heating rate left at 9 hr and right at 60 hr for top “Clean”, middle “Polluted” and bottom “Double”. Positive diabatic heating rates solid lines are contoured with an interval of 5 K hr −1 at 9 hr and 20 K hr −1 at 60 hr. Negative diabatic heating rates dotted lines are contoured with an interval of 5 K hr −1 at 9 hr and 10 K hr −1 at 60 hr. and producing cold pools that inhibit further development of the eyewall. The occurrences of these spiral rainbands could be contributing to the weakening of the storms after 60 hr in these three simulations. Another factor that could contribute to the weakening of the storms is the vertical wind shear induced by asymmetry of convection. This wind shear also leads to the small displacements of storm centers up to 30 km from their original positions. For the above three simulations, increased CCN led to increases in V ccn , N ccn , N c , and a decrease in D m with the difference in storm structure and diabatic heating distribution seen as early as the VHTs forming stage. These trends were consistently observed in the additional set of simulations with the same CCN profiles but with an alternate GCCN vertical profile as described in Section 2 . However, the simple act of just changing the vertical GCCN profile did not result in a monotonic decrease of MSLP with increasing CCN. Simulated storms reached their maximum intensity with MSLP of 970.3 hPa at 62 hr, 970.4 hPa at 71 hr and 966.5 hPa at 66 hr for simulations with CCN profiles as used in “Clean”, “Polluted” and “Double”, respectively. The simulation with initial CCN profile the same as “Polluted” was the weakest storm for 88% of the time after 30 hr. Although GCCN concentration is a small value compared to CCN concentration, GCCN could help to produce giant cloud droplets and affect the TC evolution by modifying the precipitation process and the latent heating distribution. The effect of CCN on TC intensity evolution can vary according to GCCN and presumably other environmental conditions. A more detailed analysis of the physical processes by which CCN and GCCN affected the development of the idealized TC will be presented in the future.[14]  This paper presents evidence to show that dust as CCN may play a role in a TC's development during its interaction with the SAL. The simulations of an idealized TC using the RAMS model initialized with a pre-TC MCV have shown that dust in the SAL acting as CCN can influence TC development by inducing changes in the hydrometeor properties, modifying the storm diabatic heating distribution and thermodynamic structure, and ultimately influencing the TC intensity through complex dynamical responses. It has also been shown that the impact of varying CCN on storm intensity evolution is modified by other environmental conditions, such as the ambient GCCN concentration and its vertical profile. Ensemble simulations with combinations of various CCN, GCCN, and IN profiles under a variety of environmental conditions will be necessary in the future.[15]  In nature, relationships between CCN, GCCN and IN in SAL-TC systems are more complex than suggested by the idealized simulations presented here. Sea salt and other particles from evaporated sea spray generated by high winds are also significant sources of CCN and GCCN. The relative importance of nucleating aerosols under various meteorological conditions, such as SST, wind shear and dry air intrusion, needs to be evaluated. Such impacts will need to be examined in a comprehensive coupled surface-ocean-atmosphere model under a wide range of conditions in the future."
167,dust climate,"Meteoric smoke concentration in the Vostok ice core estimated from superparamagnetic relaxation and some consequences for estimates of Earth accretion rate. We measured the magnetization of glacial and interglacial ice from the Vostok core to estimate the meteoric smoke concentration in Antarctic ice. We have found that, within the uncertainty of the method, the smoke concentration in ice in Antarctica is equivalent to that previously measured in Greenland ice. The virtually identical smoke concentrations despite the different ice accumulation rates in Greenland and Antarctica suggest that wet deposition is the main deposition mechanism for such ultra-small particles. Given the typical scavenging ratios for atmospheric aerosols, this would imply that previous estimates of accretion rate based on dry deposition are likely to be appreciably overestimated. . The IRM of ice is thus expected to be linearly correlated with dust concentration and measurements on Greenland NorthGRIP ice samples have showed that this is indeed the case. However, this work also revealed that a large portion of the IRM is carried by highly magnetic, nanometric-sized particles that were explained as fallout of meteoric smoke. These nano-particles originated from atmospheric ablation of meteorites and micrometeorites at high ∼100 km altitude and are transported in the stratosphere mostly over the poles during the winter season by atmospheric circulation. There is now direct evidence for the existence of these particles in the atmosphere and indicates that they are clearly correlated Figure 2 , which is the same pattern observed in the NorthGRIP results. Moreover, the variability of the ST magnetization as indicated by the standard deviations is comparable to that of the dust concentrations, although the lower resolution of the available dust data does not allow a detailed comparison. A relatively high SP fraction was found in Vostok ice, with a relatively large background value that is actually higher than ST magnetization when dust concentrations are low during the Holocene to ∼350 m although SP values are less elevated than ST magnetization when dust concentrations are generally high in the last glacial maximum ∼350–500 m . We cannot exclude the possibility that part of the magnetic relaxation may be due to large multi-domain grains >1000 nm for magnetite , which can loose some of their magnetization by warming through the Verwey transition. However, most of them those larger than 1300 nm are recognized in grain-size analysis, and thus, they are not included in the offset of dust magnetization. For interglacial samples, the loss of magnetization is so large that it would require an unrealistically large fraction of large multi-domain grains that somehow escaped detection by grain size analyses; for glacial samples, large multi-domain particles are likely to be included in the dust measurements and this will tend to factor out their influence on the relaxation magnetization that is uncorrelated to dust concentration. as well as the very low stable ST magnetization values for Holocene ice at Vostok Figure 2 . The linear correlation between SP and ST Figure 3 thus reflects a common terrestrial dependence, whereas the significant positive offset in the linear regression is explained as the uniform meteoric contribution to SP magnetization. The best estimate of the meteoric smoke magnetization, calculated on the basis of mean values of SP and ST magnetization at each level and taking into account errors in both coordinates in the linear regression, is 8.1 ± 2.7 × 10 −9 Am 2 kg −1 1 σ uncertainty of the regression line ; a similar magnetization is obtained using single-sample values of SP and ST in the regression.Correlation between ST, a proxy for terrestrial dust, and SP, a proxy for a combination of terrestrial dust and meteoric smoke. The non-zero SP intercept of the linear regression gray band is interpreted as the best estimate of the ice magnetization due to meteoric smoke. Linear regressions were computed both for the averaged groups of data solid line, open squares with 1 sigma error bars and for single data points dashed line, closed circles taking into account errors in both coordinates. Open circles represent two outlier samples that were discarded from linear regression., gives an expected saturation magnetization M s for the meteoric smoke particles in the ice of 30 Am 2 kg −1 and a corresponding saturation IRM M r of about 50% of that value assuming M r /M s = 0.5 . For NorthGRIP ice in Greenland, we obtained a smoke concentration of 0.78 ± 0.25 ppb which, given the above assumptions, corresponds to a Fe concentration of 0.19 ppb. This estimate compares well with a concentration of 0.18 ppb for chondritic Fe inferred from independent Ir measurements at the same site. The virtually identical results obtained from iridium and magnetic measurements in NorthGRIP ice support the assumed value of smoke magnetization and an M r /M s ratio of 0.5 and allow us to apply the same technique in Vostok ice in Antarctica, even though iridium measurements are not available for this ice core. Following this approach we obtain a Fe concentration of 0.13 ppb and a corresponding smoke concentration in Antarctic ice of 0.53 ± 0.18 ppb, where the quoted error simply indicates the uncertainty of the regression line. , which gives a flux of 1.1 ± 0.35 × 10 −8 kg/m 2 /yr. Extrapolated over the entire planet, this flux value would imply an Earth accretion rate of 5.4 ± 1.8 kt/yr. Such an accretion rate is about one order of magnitude smaller than the 64 ± 18 kt/yr estimated from NorthGRIP ice in Greenland, the difference mainly arising from the 8x larger snow accumulation rates at NorthGRIP ∼160 kg/m 2 /yr; because our estimates of meteoric smoke concentration in the two regions are rather similar 0.78 ± 0.25 ppb in Greenland vs. 0.53 ± 0.18 ppb in Antarctica . The similar smoke concentration suggests that wet deposition may be the main process of deposition of nanometric-sized particles whereby smoke concentration in ice largely reflects that of the atmosphere. The slightly smaller smoke concentration in Vostok ice compared to NorthGRIP ice could be explained by the effect of wet deposition removing more smoke from the air parcel as it travels toward the higher latitude of the Vostok core. Extrapolation of an Earth accretion rate from local fluxes governed by wet deposition would thus be highly dependent on local precipitation rates., a total mass of atmosphere of 5.15 × 10 18 kg, and a nominal smoke residence time in the atmosphere of 12–16 months, maximum estimates of Earth accretion rate range from 9 kt/yr to only 18 kt/yr mean 14 kt/yr from Vostok ice in Antarctica and from 14 kt/yr to only 26 kt/yr mean 20 kt/yr for NorthGRIP ice in Greenland. These maximum accretion rates fall close to the lower tail of the 40 ± 20 kt/yr range proposed by Love and Brownlee or ∼64 kt/yr are likely to be overestimated by at least a factor of two."
168,aerosol,"Mesoscale modeling of aeolian dust emission during the BoDEx 2005 experiment. The Bodele depression Northern Chad is believed to be the single largest source for the Saharan dust transported over the Atlantic Ocean, especially that emerging in the Gulf of Guinea in boreal winter. During the Bodele Dust Experiment 2005 BoDEx 2005 , which was performed in February-March 2005, a severe dust event was observed and some of its main characteristics surface wind, dust concentrations, radiation were recorded. This paper tests the capability of a mesoscale model coupled online with a dust production model DPM to reproduce the small scale features associated to this dust event. These simulations clearly show that a spatial resolution of 10 km x 10 km is required to reproduce satisfactorily the observed surface winds and the main characteristics of the dust plume. , , Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer.  Modeling this LLJ is particularly difficult using global models.  Two of the main results obtained during this campaign were the verification of the presence of the LLJ evident in the reanalysis data and a quantification of the near surface winds associated with dust emissions. A pronounced diurnal cycle in wind velocity was observed, with a phase shift between the surface and boundary layer i.e., the LLJ such that at the surface, there is a maximum in the midmorning and a minimum at night; the reverse occurs in altitude for the LLJ core. Moreover, speeds in excess of 16 ms −1 were measured at 2m agl on dusty days. Model experiments indicate that the inertial oscillation mechanism is responsible for the diurnal structure Todd et al., submitted manuscript, 2006 ., coupled online with the Dust Production Model DPM developed by  In Figure 3a , we present the MODIS image Terra for March 11 at 1000 UTC whereas Figure 3b displays the modeled column dust load vertical integration at the same time. On a qualitative basis, the simulations reproduce quite well the dust emission area including its extension and the location of the most emitting places. a MODIS Terra black and white image for March 11 at 0950 UTC. b Modeled dust concentration for March 11 at 1000 UTC. c Modeled optical depth from March 7 to March 13 at Chicha black line and corresponding radiometric AERONET and microtops handheld photometers data diamonds for 440 nm and crosses for 670 nm . suggest that the extinction coefficient in source area like Chicha site could range from 0.1 to 0.2 m 2 g −1 at 550 nm. Figure 3c presents the simulated DOT for the period from March 7 to March 13. The central curve is the DOT considering an extinction coefficient of 0.15 m 2 g −1 ; the error bars are obtained using the minimal and maximal values of the interval suggested by .. Simulations performed with a spatial resolution of 10 km × 10 km allows to retrieve the dynamical small scale features of the Bodélé region but also to reproduce the measured surface wind fields responsible for the local dust emissions. As a result, the simulated dust plume appears as consistent with satellite observation. From a quantitative point of view, the simulation reproduces the order of magnitude and the temporal variability of the measured aerosol optical thickness.[23]  This study illustrates the fact that a regional model with a spatial resolution of 10 km × 10 km is able to capture the dust emission pattern in source regions of complex topography such as the Bodélé depression. For the studied dust event, the total dust emissions computed with the RAMS model are 40% higher than the emissions computed from ECMWF surface wind fields with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°."
169,dust aerosol,"Extraordinary dust event over Beijing, China, during April 2006: Lidar, Sun photometric, satellite observations and model validation. An extraordinary dust event over Beijing April 2006 was followed by a synergy of lidar, Sun photometric and satellite measurements. Extreme aerosol optical depth AOD values 1 - 4 were measured by AERONET and MODIS over Beijing. The size distribution of the particles remained close to 2.5 mu m and the single scattering albedo was around 0.92 +/- 0.5 440 nm . Coarse particles contributed to more than 60 - 80% to the AOD values, indicating the presence of very large particles Angstrom exponent < 0.3 . Coarse particle contribution to total AOD is associated with the free-tropospheric aerosols calculated by lidar profiles 65% . Lidar vertical profiles with AOD values from AERONET were used to estimate a typical lidar ratio for the dust particles 84 sr during the most intense dust period. The DREAM forecast model was applied for the accurate description of the dust event evolution. Ground-truth data were used for the validation of DREAM over the Beijing area. . Strong winds blow sand, from desert regions, into the free troposphere where it is advected over great distances. The increasing urbanization and industrialization of the East Asia region, in accordance with the intense dust storm events mostly occurring in spring time, lead to continuously increasing particulate matter particularly in the lower troposphere. Thus, the air quality in the city of Beijing is drastically affected by both anthropogenic combustion-related and naturally occurring wind-blown mineral dust particles aerosols. These aerosols have drawn significant attention in the last years due to their role in the world climate research. The aerosol properties and their spatial and temporal variations over northern China - during dust events - have been studied using ground-based radiometer data in the late years. However, range-resolved information on Chinese dust optical properties and their spatial and temporal resolution is still limited. Recently, a 532 nm elastic lidar station was established in the Beijing area. This paper reports on an extraordinary dust event occurred over Beijing during April 2006 inducing large variability on the AOD. The dust event was followed by state-of-the-art synergistic aerosol lidar and sun photometric measurements, in conjunction with satellite observations. The contribution of natural and anthropogenic sources on the total load is studied and the obtained comprehensive dataset is used to validate a dust forecast model in the Beijing area., which results to an average uncertainty on b aer of 20–30%. The sun photometric observations were performed by a CIMEL radiometer, of the Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET , located in Beijing 39 58′ 37″N, 116 22′ 51″E . The accuracy of the presented AOD measurements is of the order of ±0.03 regarding the  In 2006, the dust activity was very pronounced during the month of April. The temporal evolution of the AOD at 440, 675 and 1020 nm, over Beijing in April 2006, observed by CIMEL AERONET. The AOD value used for the estimation of the mean LR was calculated at 532 nm by the combined use of the α and AOD values at 440 nm as measured by the CIMEL. Thus, the mean LR at 532 nm was estimated to be equal to 84 sr, which is consistent with other LR values obtained during intense Saharan dust aerosol events over Europe and Asian dust events over Japan, although in the latter case mixing of dust particles with continental and maritime ones occurs. on April, 16, was found to be equal to 740 m. This finding is consistent with the coarse particle contribution to the total AOD at 550 nm which is of the order of 70% as calculated by the CIMEL Figure 1c data for the period of the intense dust event. This result indicates that dust layers were well separated from local pollution, since mineral particles were lying mostly in the free-troposphere on April, 16. During the most intense phase of the dust outbreak on April, 17, it is evident that dust was present even in the PBL of Beijing, due to dry deposition processes. Vertical profiles of the dust concentration calculated by DREAM model not shown here show that after April, 16, dust layers move to lower altitudes, reaching finally the ground April, 17 .  Qiu and Yang the aerosol dust particles can be transported over most areas of north China towards the east, in the height range between 2–7 km, which is in full accordance with our lidar observations.[14]  The dust event reported over the Asian continent-and especially over the Beijing area- is one of the most intense of the last years, since AOD values up to 4 with corresponding α values close to 0 or even negative were observed. Intense aerosol loading with a notable temporal variation dust layers from around 6 km down to the ground was observed. The lidar observations revealed several dust layers in the height region between 2 and 6 km and IB values as high as 0.032 sr −1 were observed at 532 nm. We also showed that the lidar technique is well suited to integrate and validate other aerosol observations and modeling results. The synergistic use of the CIMEL sun photometer and the lidar technique enabled us to estimate a dust aerosol LR of 84 sr. The dust layer contribution to the total AOD was estimated to be about 60–80% according to the DREAM forecast dust layer AOD versus total AOD , the lidar FT AOD versus total AOD and the CIMEL via coarse particles versus fine observations, where large dust particles radii > 0.5 μ m contribute predominantly in the AOD observed. The good correlation in magnitude and temporal variation between the CIMEL and DREAM AOD values and the aerosol vertical profiles of backscatter and mass concentration during the intense dust phase, permitted to validate the DREAM dust forecast model data over the Beijing area. These aerosol dust optical properties in the visible spectrum are very useful as input parameters to radiative transfer models over the eastern China region, since dust aerosols can have a large climatic impact through radiative forcing perturbations."
170,aerosol ocean,"Asian dust initiated early spring bloom in the northern East/Japan Sea. Data for the TOMS aerosol index and SeaWiFS chlorophyll a clearly indicate that an early spring bloom in the northern East/Japan Sea can be initiated during the Asian dust event in association with precipitation. Spring bloom is normally initiated in this area as the surface mixed layer becomes shallower than critical depth, in accordance with Sverdrup's critical depth hypothesis. However, after the passage of Asian dust accompanied by precipitation, spring bloom was initiated about one month earlier than the bloom during non-dust event years. We found that deepening of critical depth coincided with the early spring bloom observed during wet-dust events. This early initiation of spring bloom indicates that the supply of bio-available nutrients such as iron through wet deposition induces deepening of the critical depth, which results in such an early initiation of the bloom in the area. . This transient period, during which the average light intensity of MLD is increasing under nutrient replete conditions, provides an opportunity for the development of spring bloom. Several attempts have been made to explain the initiation and development of spring bloom in the East/Japan East Sea using the critical depth concept. Recent ocean color images in the East Sea show large spatial and interannual variations in the initiation timings for spring bloom. . Deep mixed layer in the central North Atlantic was, therefore, likely to have contributed to the development of iron stress, and iron supply under this condition could affect phytoplankton growth.. In the northern East Sea located on the way of Asian dust passage, phytoplankton possibly experiences limitation by light due to deep winter mixing which, on the other hand, supplies macronutrients to the surface. In addition, according to the iron budget estimation by , iron supply by Asian dust can affect phytoplankton growth in the northern East Sea. This paper summarizes the response of phytoplankton after the passage of Asian dust over the northern East Sea using satellite chlorophyll. Then, we found that there was a significant interannual variation of. Dust events accompanied with precipitation are more efficient than dry deposition in delivering bio-available iron to the ocean. Wet deposition from Asian dust into the surface waters can supply 23% of the annual iron demand by phytoplankton near two regions B1 and B2 , assuming iron comprises 2.6% by weight of the deposition and biological available iron is 17% for wet deposition. Despite deep mixed layer resulting in co-limitation by light and iron for phytoplankton growth, early spring bloom occurred at both regions of B1 and B2 in the years of Asian dust events, especially accompanied by precipitation. Assuming that iron limitation affects only community photosynthesis, our results suggest that bio-available iron supply from Asian dust could have enhanced community photosynthesis and induced deepening of D CR in the two regions. Such a deepening could have potentially resulted in an earlier initiation of the bloom and/or increasing of chlorophyll a concentrations in the surface.. However, when wet-dust events occur, spring bloom could be initiated under the condition of deep MLD, which was compensated by deepening of D CR . This early initiation of the bloom strongly suggests the possibility that inputs of bio-available micronutrients such as iron by the dust through precipitation induce deepening of the critical depth and result in an early initiation of spring bloom. Thus, while initiation of spring bloom in the East Sea is mainly controlled by light conditions, it is also significantly affected by episodic dust inputs, especially accompanied by precipitation. Field studies on the processes involved in spring bloom and the Asian dust in the area should deserve further investigation in the near future to clarify the detailed role and effect of the dust on phytoplankton growth in the East Sea."
171,dust atmosphere,"Numerical predictions of aerosol charging and electrical conductivity of the lower atmosphere of Mars. The charging of aerosols and the conductivity of the lower, night time atmosphere of Mars are calculated. The charge distribution of aerosols was obtained by the simultaneous solution of the ion-aerosol charge balance equations. Galactic cosmic rays are the dominant ionizing process in the night time lower atmosphere producing molecular ions and ion clusters. The ion production rates for different solar activities are considered. The ion-ion recombination rates and the ion-aerosols attachment coefficients are calculated for altitudes from 0 to 70 km. Both the steady state and time dependent concentration of charged aerosols are calculated. The conductivity produced by ion-attachment of aerosols was found to decrease by a factor of five yielding a value of about 4 x 10 -12 Ohm -1 m -1 close to the surface. The effect on the conductivity of the temperature vs. altitude and the aerosol density are also estimated. ., and there may be thunderstorms too. : 1 continuum theories treat the charging of particles with sizes larger than the ionic mean free path, 2 free molecular theories are applicable to particles much smaller than the ionic mean free path and 3 transition theories apply when the size of particles becomes comparable to the ionic mean free path. As the Martian atmosphere is tenuous, the ionic mean free path is comparable to the size of the aerosols close to the surface and is larger than the size of the aerosols at higher altitudes. Therefore free molecular theories and transition theories prevail in the lower atmosphere. to calculate the electrical conductivity and charging of aerosols in the atmosphere of Titan. Ionization rates, ion-ion recombination coefficients and ion-aerosol attachment coefficients are described in the following section. These are used to calculate ion and aerosol concentrations and the conductivity of the lower night time atmosphere of Mars. Ionization rates are required to calculate the ion concentrations and therefore it is essential to consider the ionization processes. The detailed study of the lower atmosphere of Mars by  In the night time lower atmosphere the aerosols become charged primarily by ion attachment. The rate at which steady-state is achieved in various ion environments requires absolute values of the ion-aerosol attachment coefficients and results in a statistical distribution of charge states. . Unfortunately the vertical structure of these variations is not available and have not been included in the present model. . In the present work the maximum number of charges is initially assumed to be 100. The ionic balance equations can be written as Here, α is the ion-ion recombination coefficient, q is the ion production rate, β j i is the attachment coefficient for ions of polarity j 1 for positive and 2 for negative to particles with charge i and N i is the density of particles of charge i . The quantities q, α and β are assumed to vary with altitude. The value of q ranges from 5.03 to 0.0069 cm −3 s −1 in the altitude region from 0 to 70 km. α varies in the range from 2.8 × 10 −13 to 9.3 × 10 −13 m 3 s −1 over the same altitude range. The values of β are all of the order of ∼−8 at the surface and −11 m 3 s −1 at 70 km. The terms in the sum in equations 2 and 3 represent ionic losses due to attachment to aerosols carrying −p to +p elementary charges. The corresponding equations for the charge on the aerosols are The elementary charges on the aerosols are allowed to vary between plus and minus 100 and therefore there are 203 simultaneous differential equations for each altitude. The differential equations are solved using the 5th order Runge-Kutta method. This approach is used to solve the set of equations at 10 km altitude intervals using the charge conservation as a check on the calculations.  Figure 2 presents the altitude profile of neutral as well as charged aerosols at steady-state. More than 80% of the neutral aerosols get charged close to the surface and almost none become charged at the upper boundary 70 km . This is due to the characteristics of the ion-aerosol attachment coefficients and the number density of the aerosols.Altitude profile of the aerosols with charges 0, 1, 2, 5 and 10 at steady-state. The dashed lines represent the negatively charged and solid lines represent the positively charged aerosols. In the case of Earth's atmosphere the conductivity increases above the ionization peak, which is approximately 10 km on average. For Mars the ionization peak occurs at the surface and the conductivity increases from the surface up to 70 km. This is due to less frequent collisions between ions and neutrals, which is a result of smaller number density. This, in turn, leads to smaller cluster size and the attachment rate. The number density of positive ions at the surface and at 70 km are 2.9 × 10 9 and 1.7 × 10 8 m −3 respectively, resulting in mobilities of 0.015 and 35 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . Whereas the density decreases by an order of magnitude in going from 0 to 70 km, the mobility increases by more than 3 orders of magnitude. The presence of aerosols decreases the conductivity by vastly increasing the mass of the charge carriers. As aerosols are present in greater quantities closer to the surface, the conductivity closer to the surface is lowered dramatically as indicated by the solid line in Figure 3 .Conductivity of the lower atmosphere of Mars. The solid line represents the conductivity calculated for ion production rate at solar minimum conditions. Line with squares represents the conductivity calculated for ion production rate at solar maximum conditions. The lines with pluses and triangles represent the conductivity with 5 times more and 5 times less aerosols respectively. The line with circles represents the conductivity in the absence of aerosols. The Mars Global Surveyor radio science instrument has observed the temperature structure of the southern hemisphere in summer. To study the effect of the temperature structure on the conductivity, the above calculations have also been carried out using this temperature profile, which shows an inversion at 10 km and then decreases with altitude and becomes similar to that in the northern summer at the upper boundary 70 km . The difference observed in the conductivity due to the different temperature structures is less than 5%. The temperature structure for different seasons and latitudes were considered and the one mentioned above showed maximum variation from the one observed by Mars Pathfinder in the Northern summer. Therefore it is apparent that the variation in conductivity due to different temperature structures is very small. and yearly, due to the global atmospheric pressure variations. The results of these variations will be presented in a subsequent paper.. The conductivity decreases by a factor of two at the surface for b = 0.1 and increases by a factor of two for b = 0.4. At the upper boundary the conductivities were within 1% of each other. For b = 0.1, the number density at the surface is about a factor of two less and for b = 0.4 it is about a factor of two greater than that of b = 0.25. The effective radius is about 7% less and for b = 0.1 and is about 7% greater for b = 0.4 than that for b = 0.25 at the surface.. The conductivity decreases by about an order of magnitude at the surface when the optical depth is increased to ∼3. The ionization peak may also vary with the dust loading, however, we have not studied its sensitivity to aerosol concentration. suggested that the best estimate of the conductivity at the surface is in the range ∼10 −12 –10 −10 Ohm −1 m −1 . In the present work we calculated the night time conductivity and found that the conductivity at the surface is ∼4 × 10 −12 Ohm −1 m −1 , which is within the predicted range.[25]  Following are the important conclusions of the present study of the night time conductivity of the lower Martian atmosphere:[26]  1. more aerosols about 80% become charged closer to the surface than at higher altitudes;[27]  2. the charge state of the aerosols at lower altitudes is higher up to ±36 ;[28]  3. the variation of the night time conductivity is less than 5% due to the differences in the seasonal and latitudinal temperature structure;[29]  4. the conductivity varies by about a factor of two in going from solar minimum to solar maximum conditions;[30]  5. the conductivity changes by a factor of 3–4 for a change of a factor of 5 in the aerosol concentration; and[31]  6. when the atmospheric opacity due to an increase in aerosol density is increased to ∼3, the conductivity at the surface is reduced by almost an order of magnitude.[32]  A decrease in conductivity indicates that space charge is residing on particles. When there is large population of highly charged particles, the discharge mechanism also becomes more effective, which can produce lightning etc. The present calculations are made for the night time Martian atmosphere. The daytime conductivity which includes the solar EUV radiation is being studied. Grard [1995] have estimated that the solar EUV photons with energies up to 6 eV penetrate the atmosphere of Mars and emit electrons from aerosols of the lower atmosphere of Mars. Presently the equations are solved only for monodispersed aerosols. Polydisperse aerosols are also being included in the simulations that are in progress."
191,atmosphere clouds,"Significant vertical water transport by mountain-induced circulations on Mars. Using a 3-D, non-hydrostatic mesoscale Mars atmospheric model with detailed aerosol/cloud microphysics, we show that the formation of discrete afternoon clouds over the Olympus Mons volcano is due to the symbiosis of upslope thermal flow and a lee mountain wave circulation, and that these clouds exhibit complex particle distributions. Furthermore, we illustrate that this and other mountain-induced circulations transport large quantities of dust, water vapor, and water ice aerosol from lower altitudes into the free atmosphere general circulation. Therefore, these circulations are an important part of Mars' net Hadley circulation and climatic forcing. , the Mariner 9 orbiter, the dual Viking orbiters, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Mars Orbiter Camera MOC aboard the Mars Global Surveyor MGS spacecraft reveal that all four primary Tharsis volcanoes Olympus Mons, Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Arsia Mons are seasonally associated with relatively discrete, bright, and optically thick clouds that are “anchored” with respect to the underlying topography. Often first appearing in late morning above their summit calderas, the clouds increase in areal extent and brightness with time, ultimately becoming horizontal “plumes” stretching westward for up to several hundred kilometers by mid-afternoon. Data from the Mariner 9 infrared spectrometer demonstrate that these clouds are likely composed of water ice crystals only microns in diameter.. Previous works have mentioned that thermally-driven slope flow is likely an influential component of this vertical motion, although other distinct types of atmospheric circulations i.e., mountain waves, “barrier” uplift may also have significant roles. Further details about these clouds e.g., particle size distribution, three-dimensional morphology, time evolution, climatic role are poorly constrained or largely unknown, due to the paucity of appropriate observations. Fortunately, the above details may be recovered or constrained using appropriate three-dimensional numerical atmospheric models suitably validated against observations. reveals that the cloud “plumes” are oriented directly downwind of the volcanoes and have an extent roughly consistent with the distance the general circulation would have transported material downstream since late morning. MGCMs with simplified aerosol/cloud microphysics often form significant water ice clouds in the lee of Olympus Mons that are qualitatively similar to observations. However, current MGCMs with a typical grid cell size >4 × 4 degrees in latitude/longitude resolve Olympus Mons and its associated atmospheric circulations only marginally at best, and therefore are poorly suited for investigating the detailed formation processes and nature of these discrete clouds. A mesoscale typical grid cell size <100 km model ideally with detailed aerosol/cloud microphysics is more appropriately suited for the investigation of these clouds.. Thus any process that significantly enhances or reduces the extent of such clouds or dust either directly or indirectly is also climatologically important. Another MGCM study revealed a modulating feedback between thermal atmospheric tides and the regional-scale water-ice clouds of Tharsis and the Martian tropics at least during the northern hemisphere mid-summer . Furthermore, their modeling results indicated a significant diurnal cycle in cloud extent and thickness over the Tharsis region.. For this investigation, MRAMS was coupled to a detailed, time-dependent aerosol/cloud microphysics model. A simpler microphysical model was not used because of the known sensitivity of MGCM results to the choice of simplified cloud scheme used, largely because of differing assumptions and approximations. In order to minimize this issue, the microphysical model used in this study has minimal assumptions and approximations, and discretizes the mass size distributions of dust and water ice aerosol particles into bins 8 dust bins from 0.05–5 μm; 18 water-ice bins from 0.07–102 μm . All modeled aerosol particles are subject to the full range of atmospheric transport, including gravitational settling precipitation and turbulent mixing. Water ice is permitted to heterogeneously nucleate and then deposit/sublimate on the explicitly modeled airborne dust. The coupling of this microphysical code with MRAMS permits the detailed investigation of cloud formation on Mars by explicitly modeling the evolution of the water-ice and dust particle size distributions. Additionally, all aerosol particles are treated as being radiatively active, using a two-stream radiative transfer algorithm. provided MRAMS with its initial state and time-dependent boundary conditions. The mesoscale model was then run for several sols i.e., Mars-days; ending at L s ≃ 100° until a relatively stable diurnal cycle of cloud development was achieved. indicate that at this season, only Ascraeus and Olympus Mons have relatively abundant water vapor in their vicinity this is also the case in the MRAMS initial condition . Correspondingly, the shape, orientation, and qualitative opacity of the simulated clouds associated with Ascraeus and Olympus Mons are quite similar to those seen by the MOC. Note that the nested grid structure and model spinup period used here, the short radiative time constant of Mars' atmosphere, and strong topographic control of regional circulations significantly reduce the influence of the MGCM initial state on the MRAMS results. Even so, differences between the real-world state “weather” and the probable state computed by models “climate” are possible e.g., the thin cloud over Arsia Mons that is only present in the MRAMS solution . Bolstered by the very good qualitative agreement between the modeled and observed clouds, the dynamics and microphysics of the clouds simulated by the model are taken as a realistic numerical representation of natural cloud formation.Clouds over the Tharsis volcanoes L s ≃ 100°, ∼1345 LST at Arsia Mons . a Portion of composite color MOC wide-angle imagery M23-00630&1; blue & red filter channels, green ≃ blue + red /2 . b MRAMS water-ice cloud total column opacity in the 400–800 nm spectral band white shading , with model topography contoured gray; interval is 2.4 km for reference. The approximate location/orientation of the MOC image yellow lines , and the location of the cross-section shown in Figure 2 red dashed line are also indicated. A wide variety of cloud particle populations is present in the model results. Rapid growth in water-rich CGR1 and water-poor CGR2 results in narrow distributions of water-ice particles with relatively large r eff ≃ 8 μm and small r eff ≃ 2 μm effective radii, respectively. The CGR1 effective radius is consistent with telescopic spectral determinations of Elysium Mons afternoon cloud particles, while the CGR2 particle size is similar to the TES-derived results of Wolff and Clancy  The simulated particle size and spatial distributions are clearly in conflict with simple microphysical representations used in some models, and also with TES retrievals of aerosol effective radius that assume that particle sizes are constant with height. Therefore, the magnitude of the effect of these significant spatial and temporal variations of aerosol size distributions should be considered when interpreting radiance-derived and model-predicted fields that are based on simpler assumptions about aerosol size and spatial distributions.. In the lee of Olympus Mons a strong mountain wave dominates, but is not properly juxtaposed with the moisture field and is therefore unable to significantly enhance the nocturnal clouds. Instead, the warm sector of the wave sublimates adjacent portions of the nocturnal cloud “shield”, then vertically transports the resulting water vapor and dust mass upward to altitudes greater than 40 km. At all times of day, therefore, Olympus Mons circulations vertically transport large amounts of water, dust, and air mass..Illustrations of the time-average over 1 sol; green lines reference zero atmospheric pumps induced by Ascraeus Mons solid profiles and Olympus Mons dotted profiles , and also the instantaneous enrichment of their environment areas used to calculate the time-average profiles outlined in yellow . a Areal flux profiles for dry air. b Areal flux profiles for total water substance vapor + ice; black , and total dust substance free dust + that within water-ice cloud particles; red . c Profiles of the areal flux convergence of the total water substance. d Instantaneous 1600 UT; ∼0800 LST at Arsia Mons plot of plumes of relatively large total water substance mass mixing ratio color shading on a constant areopotential surface of 43.5 km. Model topography is shown for reference white contours ., as well as possible but as of yet unobserved high-altitude layers of water vapor. The Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft may be able to confirm the presence of these elevated aerosol and vapor layers if they exist. These circulations may be a significant mechanism for maintaining the global atmospheric dust load above ∼10 km i.e., above the boundary layer, in the free atmosphere , since other vertical dust-transport mechanisms in the free atmosphere are much slower e.g., Hadley cell transport .. As the mountain-induced circulations of Olympus Mons and other tropical zone volcanoes are discrete i.e., areal extent is small compared with the total area of the tropics , rapid transport mechanisms for moisture and aerosols, the above analogy may thus be further extended to general circulation effects: we suggest that these mountain-induced circulations are an essential part of Mars' global atmospheric energy budget, and play important roles in the dust cycle, water cycle, and the cycles of other chemical species that are significantly affected by rapid vertical transport through the lowest several scale heights of the atmosphere.[17]  In summary, we utilized a mesoscale atmospheric model MRAMS with sophisticated aerosol/cloud microphysics to investigate the cloud formation and circulations that Olympus Mons and other Mars volcanoes induce in early northern hemisphere summer L s ≃ 100° . MRAMS simulations are found to qualitatively reproduce observed cloud locations, orientations, and morphologies well. The formation of discrete afternoon clouds over Olympus Mons is shown to be due to the symbiosis of upslope thermal flow and a lee mountain wave circulation. We further illustrate that these two mountain-induced atmospheric circulations thermally-driven slope flows and mountain waves cause the vertical transport of water substance throughout each Mars day. We find that the daily net effect of the circulations induced by Ascraeus and Olympus Mons at this season is to pump large quantities of water vapor, water ice aerosol, and dust upward from lower levels, injecting the said material into the free atmosphere general circulation, where it may be further transported globally. Furthermore, these mountain-induced circulations may be a significant perhaps primary mechanism for injecting water, dust, and other aerosols above 40 km in altitude. Finally, the effects of the atmospheric circulations induced by large mountains on Mars are found to be analogous to terrestrial thunderstorms in many ways, including being an important part of Mars' net Hadley circulation and therefore the atmospheric water and dust cycles , and thus are climatologically significant."
193,dust aerosol,"Ship-based aerosol optical depth measurements in the Atlantic Ocean: Comparison with satellite retrievals and GOCART model. Aerosol optical depth measurements were made in October - December 2004 onboard the R/V Akademik Sergey Vavilov. The cruise area included an Atlantic transect from North Sea to Cape Town and then a crossing in the South Atlantic to Argentina. In the open oceanic areas not influenced by continental sources aerosol optical depth values were close to background oceanic conditions tau a similar to 0.06 - 0.08 . Spectral dependence, especially in the high latitude Southern Atlantic, can be considered as quasi-neutral Angstrom parameter a was less than 0.4 . Back-trajectory analysis allowed statistical division of the aerosol optical parameters and showed similar properties for the North Atlantic polar marine, South Atlantic subtropical marine and South Atlantic polar marine air. Ship-borne aerosol optical depth comparisons to GOCART model and satellite retrievals revealed systematic biases. Satellite retrieved optical depths are generally higher by 0.02 - 0.07 depending on the sensor , especially in low tau a conditions. GOCART model simulated optical depths correlate well with the ship measurements and, despite overall bias and a notable disparity with the observations in a number of cases, about 30% agree within +/- 0.01. , combined with very few systematic measurements over the oceans, especially in the South Ocean, create a demand for more data acquisition. Recently the Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET established a few new island sites in the Southern Ocean, however, large areas south of 35° still have no coverage. Ship-based measurements can at least partly fill the gap which exists in our knowledge on the global aerosol distribution over the oceans. and in the global validation of two channel AVHRR aerosol optical thickness retrievals . Certain steps in these directions have been recently made and hopefully will continue. The Microtops II sun photometer is a handheld instrument specifically designed to measure columnar optical depth and water vapor content. Direct sun measurements are acquired in five spectral channels at 340, 440, 675, 870, and 940 nm. The instrument has built-in pressure and temperature sensors. To obtain the time of measurements and geographical position of the ship a GPS was connected to the sunphotometer. The instrument was calibrated at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center against the AERONET reference CIMEL Sun/sky radiometer. The estimated uncertainty of the optical depth in each channel did not exceed plus or minus 0.02, which is slightly higher than the uncertainty of the AERONET field not master instruments, as shown by agree within 0.005 or less. Aerosol optical depth values are close to the background oceanic conditions 0.06–0.08 at 500 nm in the open oceanic areas not influenced by continental sources or long-range aerosol transport. Spectral dependence τ , . Optical depth in the SA Tropical region 6°–21° S was higher than during the Aerosols99 Experiment; however,  Aerosol optical depth can be retrieved from satellite data. The ship-borne sunphotometer data set provided excellent opportunity for comparison. Satellite retrievals were collocated with the ship position whenever possible, although in the conditions of the relatively stable optical properties during the day small standard deviations of daily means exact matching in space and time is less important. Sunphotometer measurements were spectrally adjusted using log-linear interpolation to the “validation” satellite wavelength. and satellite retrieved aerosol optical depths versus sunphotometer data. A positive intercept is evident for all sensors except for MISR. Table 2 shows that in the current study the performance of the MISR algorithm version 15 was better comparing to reported by ; and the operational AVHRR product yielded a less accurate result compared to retrieval methodology. In order to better visualize aerosol optical depth differences between satellite and sunphotometer retrievals we present them against ground-truth τ a separately for the morning and afternoon satellites wherever possible Figure 4 . Figure 4 shows that satellite retrieved τ a tend to overestimate optical depth especially when τ a is small. MISR and AVHRR-GISS did slightly better than others; however, their number of match-up cases was limited.Aerosol optical depth differences between various sensors and sunphotometer. The principal conclusions from our work can be summarized as follows: .[18]  2. Almost 60% of satellite retrieved optical depths, although highly correlated with the sunphotometer measurements R = 0.85–0.99 , are generally higher by 0.02–0.07, depending on sensor see Figure 5 . A wide range of factors can be responsible for that but we do not discuss them in the current study. The GOCART model calculated aerosol optical depths, on the other hand, are less correlated with sunphotometer measurements R = 0.59 , and, despite the overall bias, about 30% agree within ±0.01."
194,dust aerosol,"On the variability of African dust transport across the Atlantic. We investigate the interannual variability of Saharan dust transport over the Atlantic by using the TOMS/ Nimbus-7 and TOMS/ Earth Probe daily aerosol data. We focus on the winter season, and on the area off the North-West African coast 15 - 30 degrees N, 30 - 5 degrees W . Previous studies have suggested that the variability of the Saharan dust can be partially explained by the North Atlantic Oscillation. In an alternative approach, we correlate the aerosol data with the positions and the surface pressure values of the two ""Centers of Action'' in the Atlantic, the Azores High and the Icelandic Low. This approach decouples the two semipermanent pressure systems, and it reveals that the Icelandic Low does not play a role in the dust concentration for our region of interest. Instead, the position of the Azores High turns out to be the most important factor, with the Azores High latitude yielding the highest correlation r = 0.48 . . It has been known for a long time that large dust plumes are transported to the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea from the Saharan desert and surrounding regions. This export is subject to a strong interannual variability, which in turn is related to the large-scale circulation. Understanding this variability is key to quantifying the impact of mineral dust on the various processes in the climate system.. The NAO index is based on the difference of the pressure anomalies between Stykkisholmur, Iceland representing the Icelandic Low and Lisbon, Portugal representing the Azores High . This index, however, does not account for the positions of the semi-permanent pressure systems that it represents. In a second step we will apply a new approach to shed light on the variability and the underlying mechanisms of dust transport over the Atlantic Ocean. We consider the 23 years of TOMS satellite data in conjunction with the positions and the surface pressure values of the two “Centers of Action” COA in the Atlantic, that is, the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. This concept has been successfully applied to a range of problems such as explaining the variations of zooplankton in the Gulf of Maine and the position of the Gulf stream northwall. With this approach we are able to explain the variability of dust transport to a higher degree and on a more fundamental level than it is possible with the NAO index... For the Version 8 data this quantity is defined as where in the following way. The pressure index The correlation of the COA indices and the AAI reveals that the pressure values of both the Azores High and the Icelandic Low do not show significant correlations with the AAI. The positions of the pressure centers appear to be more important, where the Icelandic Low as a whole plays a secondary role. This is in agreement to findings of  We are aware that a drift in AAI data might affect the correlations after the year 2000 see http://jwocky.gsfc.nasa.gov/aerosols/aerosols.html . To investigate this drift we calculate correlations only up to the year 2000. The correlations change slightly, and are r = 0.20 for AAI and NAO, and r = 0.48 for AAI and Azores High latitude. We then fit a linear trend to AAI for 2000–2004. Assuming that this trend is due to drifting calibration, we correct the AAI for this trend. The correlations for the corrected AAI 1979–2004 are r = 0.44 with Azores High latitude significant at 5% and r = 0.07 with NAO. We can conclude that the apparent instrument drift over the last 4 years does not affect the conclusion that AAI in this region is correlated primarily with the Azores High latitude and not with the NAO. First, detailed analysis has shown that while Version 7 and Version 8 data can be roughly related by an affine mapping, there is scatter in the relationship, and moreover, the relationship varies from year to year. This scatter causes differences in seasonal and spatial averages from year to year. It seems that the correlation coefficient is sensitive to these changes. To corroborate our result we carried out the same analysis for aerosol optical depth AOT measured by AVHRR which is available over the ocean only and for 1981 to 2004. These results are also displayed in Table 1 . For the winter seasons of 1982–1993, the correlation coefficient of AVHRR-AOT and NAO is 0.46, and it decreases as the time period is extended to 2004 to 0.37. We averaged over the 5 years when the Azores High latitude was lowest 1980, 1982, 1985, 1986, 2001 and when it was highest 1983, 1992, 1993, 2000, 2002 . According to our correlation, a low Azores High latitude corresponds to lower AAI and vice versa. The map of wind anomalies and the Palmer Drought Index are consistent with this finding. Figure 3a shows the difference field of the averaged wind anomalies and the corresponding AAI for the 5 years when the Azores High latitude was highest and for the 5 years when the Azores High latitude was lowest, and Figure 3b shows the difference of the average Palmer drought index for the two 5-year data sets.  Figure 3a also reveals that over large parts of the source regions in the Saharan desert, the differences in AAI are close to zero. Positive differences, hence more dust in the high phase, occur in the region over Mauretania, Morocco and parts of Algeria, as well as in the Sahel zone. Some source areas Tunesia, Libya/Egypt display negative differences. Our results show that explaining the variability of dust transport over the eastern part of the northern tropical Atlantic using Center of Actions is more appropriate than using the NAO index, since the position of the semi-permanent pressure systems is a key factor. For the chosen region, the Azores High plays the dominant role. The latitudinal position of the Azores High is the parameter that displays the highest correlation with the spatially averaged AAI. The Icelandic Low plays a subordinate role.[28]  We emphasize that this result depends heavily on the choice of the target area. For other regions of the Atlantic Ocean a different COA parameter may gain in importance."
195,particles clouds,"Aerosol chemistry and climate: Laboratory studies of the carbonate component of mineral dust and its reaction products. The hygroscopicity, cloud condensation nucleation CCN activity and infrared optical extinction of CaCO3, a reactive component of mineral dust aerosol, and Ca NO3 2 , a product of atmospherically-aged CaCO3 through reaction with nitrogen oxides, have been measured. The hygroscopic growth and CCN activity of Ca NO3 2 are orders of magnitude greater than CaCO3 and more similar to ammonium sulfate. Ca NO3 2 particles also reflect a greater amount of near infrared radiation at higher relative humidity. These measurements provide the first quantitative assessment of the important changes in climate forcing that can occur as mineral dust aerosol is transported, reacted and aged in the atmosphere.  and the nucleation of clouds. It can also impact the chemical balance of the Earth's atmosphere through heterogeneous chemistry. One important issue when quantifying the impact of mineral dust on atmospheric chemistry and climate is in assessing how its physicochemical properties change as it is transported, reacted and aged in the atmosphere. Although these issues are recognized as being important, they are poorly understood and little quantitative laboratory data are available on the link between mineral dust aerosol chemistry and climate.. The carbonate component of mineral dust e.g., calcite CaCO 3 and dolomite CaMg CO 3 2 is particularly reactive and can comprise as much as 30% of the total mineral dust aerosol, depending on the source region. It is well known from field studies that there is a strong correlation between Ca 2+ and NO 3 − and recently single particle analyses have shown that CaCO 3 particles can be completely converted to calcium nitrate CaNO 3 2 in the troposphere. This conversion can occur through two known pathways: , a key variable in assessing the impact of mineral dust on climate. This paper reports on a quantitative comparison of the hygroscopicity, optical properties and CCN activity of CaCO 3 and Ca NO 3 2 aerosols, providing important insights into the link between aerosol chemistry and climate as freshly emitted CaCO 3 mineral dust aerosol is entrained in the atmosphere and undergoes heterogeneous reactions with nitrogen oxides.. CaCO 3 particles show no increase in diameter as a function of RH, while Ca NO 3 2 particles grow significantly and reach a diameter of 160 nm at higher RH, as shown in Figure 1 . These data are best represented in terms of growth curves, displayed in Figure 2a . At each RH, the total hygroscopic growth is expressed as the growth factor, where D p is the particle diameter after humidification and D 0 is volume equivalent diameter of the solid particle. There is no observable growth of CaCO 3 particles up to 85% RH Figure 2a , and g RH has an average value of 1.00 ± 0.02 over the entire RH range. Previous FTIR and thermogravimetric analysis measurements of water adsorption on CaCO 3 show that 1–3 monolayers of water can be formed on the carbonate surface with increasing RH. Assuming that three monolayers correspond to between 0.5–1 nm at most, this would be equal to a growth factor near 1.01, in good agreement with our results.Hygroscopic growth of size-selected 100 nm a CaCO 3 and b Ca NO 3 2 particles as a function of RH. a Growth factors measured for size-selected 100 nm CaCO 3 filled circles and Ca NO 3 2 open circles . Each data point represents an average of 3–6 measurements. The error associated with each point is the standard deviation of these multiple measurements, which are on the order of the size of the symbols. The dashed line represents a g RH of one and the solid line is the theoretical growth curve for Ca NO 3 2 calculated from Köhler theory. b The calculated ratio of H 2 O to Ca NO 3 2 , by both mole left axis and mass right axis . The ratios are determined from the Köhler curve shown in Figure 2a. For comparison, the molar WSR deliquescence and efflorescence solid lines, left axis curves for NH 4 2 SO 4 are also displayed.. These amorphous particles are never completely “dry” and become liquid droplets near 10% RH. Thus, even at the lowest relative humidity, the particles maintain a spherical shape and a Water to Solute molar Ratio WSR near 1. Because particles are never completely “dry” upon formation, g RH will never be unity and the particles will be aqueous droplets at atmospherically relevant RH. The “dry” particle diameter used to calculate the growth factor must be determined from Köhler theory which describes the growth of aqueous solution droplets in humid air. For Ca NO 3 2 a “dry” diameter of 89 nm based on the theoretical g RH at 15% RH was used as D 0 in further calculations. With a growth factor of 1.13 ± 0.01 at 10% RH and 1.77 ± 0.05 at 85% RH, Ca NO 3 2 nearly doubles in diameter corresponding to an 8-fold increase in volume creating not only a highly aqueous environment for reactions but also can lead to an increase in the single scattering albedo of mineral dust aerosol.. At 15 and 70% RH a molar WSR of 2.94 ± 0.03 and 11.06 ± 0.23 is determined, corresponding to mass ratios of 0.32 ± 0.003 and 1.21 ± 0.03, respectively. To better understand the significance of the calculated WSR, the water content of Ca NO 3 2 can be compared with that of ammonium sulfate NH 4 2 SO 4 and montmorillonite. NH 4 2 SO 4 is known to be important in the troposphere and its hygroscopic properties have been well-characterized. Montmorillonite, another component of mineral dust, is a swellable clay mineral that can readily take up water. Below its efflorescence RH of 37%, NH 4 2 SO 4 is dry while Ca NO 3 2 contains as much as 39% water by mass. The water associated with Ca NO 3 2 is as much as 8 times greater than the water content in montmorillonite ∼5% water by mass at similar RH . Between 37 and 80% RH, NH 4 2 SO 4 may contain some amount of water, but only after it has deliquesced at 80% RH. Near 80% RH, the molar WSR of Ca NO 3 2 measured in this work is greater than that of deliquesced NH 4 2 SO 4 by a factor of approximately 1.5. These results indicate that under typical atmospheric conditions, Ca NO 3 2 is highly hygroscopic and may provide a more aqueous environment for heterogeneous chemistry than NH 4 2 SO 4 and montmorillonite., which represents a large component of CCN in the atmosphere. In contrast, at 0.11% SS none of the CaCO 3 aerosol is activated. This difference is further illustrated at 0.2% SS, where Ca NO 3 2 is 90% activated and CaCO 3 is <2% activated. Based on these results, it can be concluded that as CaCO 3 undergoes processing by HNO 3 and N 2 O 5 in the troposphere to form Ca NO 3 2 , its ability to nucleate clouds increases significantly and is nearly two orders of magnitude greater between 0.075 and 0.2% SS compared to freshly emitted carbonate aerosol, and is similar to NH 4 2 SO 4 .CCN activity for size-selected 100 nm Ca NO 3 2 amorphous hydrate open circles , CaCO 3 filled circles , and NH 4 2 SO 4 filled diamonds . The data are plotted as the fraction of CCN active particles #CCN/#CN as a function of percent water supersaturation % SS . The inset shows an expanded view of the region from 0.075 to 0.225% SS. The dashed line at 0.5% SS indicates the critical supersaturation. There is also an increase in the scatter region beyond 4000 cm −1 in the Ca NO 3 2 spectra of Figure 4b , signifying the presence of more larger particles. The relative amount of scattered light from 4000 to 7000 cm −1 is a factor of approximately three greater at the higher RH, determined from the increase of the integrated area of this region at high RH relative to low RH. There is only a slight increase in the infrared scatter region beyond 4000 cm −1 at higher RH for CaCO 3 . It has been estimated that highly hygroscopic particles reflect light 2–3 times more than dry particles in areas of high relative humidity. These measurements agree well with this estimate, implying that an aged dust particle composed of Ca NO 3 2 would scatter appreciably more light than the original CaCO 3 particle at higher RH.. The data presented in this paper is an important step in trying to better understand the impact that mineral dust aerosol chemistry with trace atmospheric gases has on climate. Ultimately, quantifying these effects on a global scale will require the use of detailed cloud microphysical and radiative forcing models, which would take into account and include heterogeneous chemistry, the presence of background particles, and meteorological conditions."
196,aerosol,"Links between topography, wind, deflation, lakes and dust: The case of the Bodele Depression, Chad. The Bodele Depression, Chad is the planet's largest single source of dust. Deflation from the Bodele could be seen as a simple coincidence of two key prerequisites: strong surface winds and a large source of suitable sediment. But here we hypothesise that long term links between topography, winds, deflation and dust ensure the maintenance of the dust source such that these two apparently coincidental key ingredients are connected by land-atmosphere processes with topography acting as the overall controlling agent. We use a variety of observational and numerical techniques, including a regional climate model, to show that: 1 contemporary deflation from the Bodele is delineated by topography and a surface wind stress maximum; 2 the Tibesti and Ennedi mountains play a key role in the generation of the erosive winds in the form of the Bodele Low Level Jet LLJ ; 3 enhanced deflation from a stronger Bodele LLJ during drier phases, for example, the Last Glacial Maximum, was probably sufficient to create the shallow lake in which diatoms lived during wetter phases, such as the Holocene pluvial. Winds may therefore have helped to create the depression in which erodible diatom material accumulated. Instead of a simple coincidence of nature, dust from the world's largest source may result from the operation of long term processes on paleo timescales which have led to ideal conditions for dust generation in the world's largest dust source. Similar processes plausibly operate in other dust hotspots in topographic depressions. . The realistic simulation of past and future climates requires the inclusion of dust-related processes. Dust source regions cannot easily be specified in such simulations, sources need to be determined from first principles, which, in turn, requires that the complex processes leading to dust-generation are understood and included in models.. Two factors account for this. First the Bodélé is a very large source of erodible sediment comprising diatomite associated with Mega-Lake Chad, which, in a vegetation free hyper arid location, ensures extreme erodibility. Secondly, the Bodélé Low Level Jet LLJ is focused onto the erodible sediments..  The Bodélé LLJ is a key feature of the mean low level atmospheric circulation over the Bodélé which coincides with the north-easterlies' exit gap between the Tibesti and Ennedi mountains. Vertical velocity fields also point to the influence of topography. Pronounced downslope flow, a unique feature of the climatology of the Bodélé region, develops in the lee of the Tibesti. The subsidence core occurs at c1.5 km overlying the depression at 18°N Figure 2 and is modulated in phase with extremes in monthly dust values as sampled from a TOMS optical thickness index of the Bodélé Figure 3 . Anomalously strong downslope flow and enhanced wind erosivity in the depression are statistically linked. Gap flows such as the Bodélé Low Level Jet are well known features of topographically constrained low level circulation.Longitude-height pressure in hPa section along 18°E between 10°N–25°N of mean 1979–1992 January to April NCEP vertical velocity Pa.s −1 *100 .

Six hourly NCEP boundary conditions were used and the Noah Land Surface Model and the MRF boundary layer schemes specified. In the TOPO experiment, topography was defined at the nested model resolution. In the NOTOPO experiment, topography was reduced to 300m above sea level. The runs covered the BoDEx period of 25 February to 12 March 2005, so model winds could be compared with the only existing observations.. In the NOTOPO experiment, the jet core is weaker and much reduced in spatial extent Figure 4 .MM5 windspeeds m.s −1 at 925 hPa shading for left NOTOPO and right TOPO experiment 28 February to 12 March 2005. Contours are topography in meters. Contemporary deflation from the Bodélé has been calculated between 640 and 780 Tg.yr −1 from simulations with GOCART. Using an estimated area of 200,000 km 2 and an average density of the diatomite material of 0.8g.cm 3 established from field samples , this equates to a lowering of the depression of between 0.26 and 0.31 cm.yr −1 , comparing well with rates estimated elsewhere Table 1 and observed flux estimates from BoDEx 180Tg. yr −1 yielding 0.3cm.yr −1 over the diatomite surface M.

Rates of deflation within the Bodélé can also be derived from a small mesa sampled during BoDEx and subjected to OSL dating sample number CH62 . The sample has an age of 2.4 ± 0.1 ka and stands 4m above the surrounding surface, yielding a deflation rate of 0.16 cm/year. Taken together the modelled, observed and proxy rates of deflation are in reasonable agreement., it is plausible that the Bodélé LLJ has had the opportunity to deflate a sizeable depression although limits on the depth of deflation will be imposed by the depth of the water table, frequency of flooding and the thickness of readily entrained sediment.P = Prescribed SSTs, C = computed SSTs.. Freshwater diatoms in sediment traps distant from source and off the main Bodélé transport pathway, suggests that the process outlined here for the Bodélé may occur elsewhere in the Sahara while the occurrence of global dust hotspots in topographic depressions suggests an even wider operation of these land surface-atmosphere interactions."
198,aerosol,"Dust events in Kanpur, northern India: Chemical evidence for source and implications to radiative forcing. Dust samples were collected and analyzed during May 2004 in Kanpur in Ganga basin , Northern India for the first time. Chemical evidence along with the air mass trajectories suggests three major sources of the mineral dusts transported to the Ganga basin. High concentration of Pb and Cd indicates possible mixing with the anthropogenic pollution. The composite aerosol model reveals low single scattering albedo similar to 0.74 due to the presence of black carbon. During the dust storms, shortwave SW clear-sky diurnally averaged top of the atmosphere TOA and surface forcing come out to be +11 +/- 0.7 and -2 +/- 63 W m -2 , respectively. Corresponding forcings in the longwave LW region are +1.9 +/- 0.6 and +1.6 +/- 0.4 W m -2 . Net atmospheric forcing i.e., SW+LW, 36 W m -2 corresponds to heating rate of similar to 1.02 degrees K/day in the lower atmosphere. Dust alone has resulted in the net TOA and surface forcings of +7 and -12 W m -2 . . They alter the radiative balance of the atmosphere by scattering and absorbing the sunlight, but are poorly characterized due to their highly variable optical properties. It has been observed that during the long-range transport over the polluted regions, dusts mix with anthropogenic aerosol species, thereby suggesting that the dust radiative impact is highly variable from region to region.. Based on the meteorological data, is ∼0.9, whereas SSA obtained from OPAC model in our study is 0.84. The high positive net TOA forcing is primarily due to high BC concentration and high surface albedo. Liao and Seinfeld [1998] have demonstrated that with increase in surface albedo, the surface cooling in SW region decreases due to enhanced multiple scattering between surface and aerosol layer and TOA forcing becomes positive warming effect . Considering the fact, that the GB experiences frequent dust storms during the pre-monsoon season, when the surface albedo is high, the radiative impact could be significant in the context of long-term climate change of the region.[15]  1. The dusts transported to the GB originated from three major sources, Oman, southwest Asian basins and Thar Desert in Rajasthan as suggested by chemical composition and air mass trajectories. Chemical data also indicates mixing of anthropogenic pollutants with the dust during transport.[16]  2. A composite aerosol model during the dust storms in Kanpur, best represented by incorporating mineral dust in ‘urban’ aerosol model of OPAC, results in low SSA ∼0.74 . Aerosols reduce the radiation reaching the surface by 26 and 1.6 W m −2 in the SW and LW region in clear-sky condition. The corresponding TOA forcings are +11 and +1.9 W m −2 .[17]  3. The net atmospheric absorption 36 ± 4 W m −2 translates to a ∼1.02° K/day heating rate. The net TOA and surface forcing due to dust alone are +7 and −12 W m −2 ."
199,ocean,"Aerosol climatology using a tunable spectral variability cloud screening of AERONET data. Aerosols, humidity and clouds are often correlated. Therefore, rigorous cloud screening can systematically bias toward less cloudy and drier conditions, underestimating the average aerosol optical thickness AOT . Here, using AERONET data we show that systematic rejection of variable atmospheric optical conditions can generate such bias in the average AOT. Therefore we recommend two approaches to deal with cloud contamination: 1 to introduce more powerful spectral variability cloud screening and 2 to retain most of the data despite cloud contamination, estimate average cloud contamination and to correct for it. Both methods are applied to aerosol with Angstrom exponent >0.3 and compared with the AERONET cloud screened level 1.5 data. The new methods do not apply for pure dust. Analysis for 10 AERONET stations with similar to 4 years of data, shows almost no change for Rome Italy , but up to a change in AOT of 0.12 or +30% in Beijing PRC . . AERONET cloud screening http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/ is based on variability within 1 minute triplet measurements and variability of consecutive samples every 15 minutes Level 1.5 cloud screening . The basic assumption is that clouds vary more than aerosols and a given threshold of variability can separate clouds from aerosol. . Application to one month of data collected in Lille, France indicates that the present L1.5 AERONET cloud screening rejects variable aerosol as clouds. Aerosols can vary due to variability in humidity, the presence of nearby sources or cloud processing. Due to the correlation between the aerosols and cloud cover, time averaged values may be influenced by the particular use of cloud screening. increases available aerosol data-volume by keeping highly variable aerosol and therefore helps improve the statistics of aerosol climatology. The physical principle behind the SVA is shown in Figure 1 . Quick observation shows that the main difference between the clouds and the aerosol in the MODIS image is the difference in color. We can also see that while the clouds are more variable than the aerosol, the heavy pollution aerosol is also highly variable. Elimination of the variable aerosol means elimination of the most concentrated aerosol. The SVA is designed to screen as clouds only measurements with significant spectrally neutral variability. Plot of the AERONET data using the SVA and L1.5 cloud screenings Figure 1 shows under representation of the hazy conditions in the L1.5 data. There is no indication in the time dependence of the Ångström exponent for cloud contamination. top MODIS image July 20, 2005 of pollution in Beijing region blue circle observed from the TERRA satellite.

SVA solid diamonds detected most of the measurements as cloud free while less than 1/3 were detected as cloud free by AERONET L1.5. The L1.5 average AOT is about 25% smaller. top Aqua image from that day ∼15 hr GMT shows very little cloud cover in the area the sunphotometer is in the blue box .:, therefore 100 m corresponds to variability of ∼0.1% in the AOT and a change in Å of only 0.002. are due to accumulation of pollution over China and under the Alps respectively. Low Å values ∼0.5 are due to desert dust. Alta Floresta, Brazil represents an area with concentrated biomass burning aerosol. Rome represents mostly local pollution with dust intrusions for lower values of Å. As expected, increase in the SVA threshold increases the number of observations included, increases the average AOT and decreases Å dashed lines in Figure 4 top , a clear evidence of the cloud contamination. The derived cloud optical depth estimates is subtracted from the total AOT. The correction removes most of the change in Å, leaving it practically constant. Note that the minimum value of the AOT indicates an optimum selection of the cloud-screening threshold with minimum contamination. The proposed new cloud screening methods are based on the spectral differences between aerosols and clouds. Therefore we limited ourselves to Å > 0.3 and were not able to include pure dust such as observed in Capo Verde with Å < 0.3 in our analysis. Except for Capo Verde Å < 0.3 occurs only 5–10% of the AERONET measurements for the stations shown in Table 1 and Figure 4 .[13]  Correction of the cloud contamination is based on a factor of 2 found to relate the cloud optical thickness and the variability of the cloud optical thickness across the 1 minute of AERONET observations. This was measured by lidar on stratocumuli in 4 different locations maritime, rural, and semi-urban and altitudes, 600, 2500 and 1000 m, respectively. This relationship should be established in more numerous cloud conditions. However, the fact that the corrected average value of Å is practically independent of the threshold of cloud screening indicates that the correction is performing well.[14]  The correlation among aerosol, the humidity field and clouds introduces errors into aerosol climatology derived using rigorous stringent cloud screening. Using AERONET data we show that screening algorithm that uses spectral variability is able to discriminate better between clouds and aerosol, but probably the least biased climatology can be achieved using a relaxed cloud screening and estimating statistically the cloud contamination, subtracting it later from the climatology. We showed that using this technique we derive higher aerosol average AOT in some polluted locations while keeping the same values in others. Much larger fractions of the data are retained in the process, while still maintaining fairly constant Ångström exponent."
200,particles impact,"Scavenging of pollutant acid substances by Asian mineral dust particles. Uptakes of sulfate and nitrate onto Asian dust particles during transport from the Asian continent to the Pacific Ocean were analyzed by using a single-particle time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Observation was conducted at Tsukuba in Japan in the springtime of 2004. Sulfate-rich dust particles made their largest contribution during the 'dust event' in the middle of April 2004. As a result of detailed analysis including backward trajectory calculations, it was confirmed that sulfate components originating from coal combustion in the continent were internally mixed with dust particles. Even in the downstream of the outflow far from the continental coastline, significant contribution of Asian dust to sulfate was observed. Asian dust plays critical roles as the carrier of sulfate over the Pacific Ocean. . Globally, it has been reported that the aerosols originating from Asia can even affect the air quality in North America. In terms of atmospheric acidification and cross-border pollution, it is also significant to clarify the mechanisms of transport of SOx and NOx from the Asian continent toward Japan, the Pacific Ocean, and North America. The identification and quantification of the chemical compositions of the aerosols are critical for the understanding of the interactions between the aerosols and pollutants it absorbed. As an outstanding phenomenon in Asia, the Asian mineral dust Kosa has been a focus of attention. The Asian dust particles may play roles as the eolian carrier of pollutants and also act as the neutralizer and scavenger of acid rain in the North Pacific region since they contain carbonic calcium about 10% . discussed dust and pollutant transport during ACE-Asia, which was conducted in the marine boundary layer near the continent. However, in situ, real-time observation of the internal mixed states is still insufficient and has never been performed far downstream of the continental outflow.. The Aerosol Mass Spectrometer AMS has been shown to quantify the chemical compositions in aerosols. To examine the different mixed states, several techniques on analyzing single particles have been developed by using the laser-based mass spectrometers.. The pressure in the particle-detection chamber was 10 −2 Pa when the flow rate of the sample was set to 500 sccm cc/min at standard conditions . A continuous wave argon ion laser 514.5 nm, 30 mW was directed at 60° from the incident particle beam to interact with the particles. Scattered light from this laser by the particle was monitored by using a photomultiplier PMT; Hamamatsu, 1P28A , at a 60° angle to the laser beam. To distinguish the scattered light signal from the PMT detector noise, an appropriate discrimination voltage was applied to the PMT. After a particle was detected from the scattered light, a pulsed excimer laser Lambda Physik, Optex, 248 nm, 5 mJ/pulse was fired to desorb and ionize the particle. The trigger of the excimer laser was 1-μs delayed from the detected scattered light on the PMT in order to distinguish the PMT signals from the detection laser and desorption laser signals. After ablation and ionization, ions were accelerated and deflected by electric fields, and introduced to the time-of-flight TOF chamber and detected by a multi-channel plate detector MCP . The typical pressure in the TOF chamber was 10 −4 Pa. The dimensions of the instrument were 150 × 80 × 80 cm. The resolution was 600 for the TOF system at  The apparent changes of the compositions in particles were captured by the single-particle TOFMS. The observed changes are consistent with the transport of the air mass. It was concluded that sulfur components were transported from the continent to Japan effectively as sulfate associated with dust. It is noticeable that sulfate association with Asian dust was significant even well downstream of the source though nitrate was insignificant. In-situ, real-time, continuous observation using the single-particle TOFMS is promising to discuss the Asian dust."
201,dust particles ocean,"Aeolian input of bioavailable iron to the ocean. Atmospheric deposition of mineral dust supplies much of the essential nutrient iron to the ocean. Presumably only the readily soluble fraction is available for biological uptake. Previous ocean models assumed this fraction was constant. Here the variable solubility of Fe in aerosols and precipitation is parameterized with a two-step mechanism, the development of a sulfate coating followed by the dissolution of iron hydr oxide on the dust aerosols. The predicted soluble Fe fraction increases with transport time from the source region and with the corresponding decrease in dust concentration. The soluble fraction is similar to 1 percent near sources, but often 10 - 40 percent farther away producing a significant increase in soluble Fe deposition in remote ocean regions. Our results may require more rapid biological and physicochemical scavenging of Fe than used in current ocean models. We further suggest that increasing SO2 emission alone could have caused significant Fe fertilization in the modern northern hemisphere oceans. . Nitrogen fixation and cycling by marine organisms are also found to depend on the concentration of dissolved Fe. Atmospheric transport and deposition of dust particles originating from deserts supplies much of the Fe that sustains biological production in the ocean. The solubility of Fe in dust is thus an important parameter in the global iron connections between desert dust, ocean biogeochemistry, and climate.. However, available measurements of Fe solubility in aerosols and precipitation see Table 1 indicate high variability and a much wider range. Furthermore, since high Fe solubility has often been measured at low dust concentrations and dust concentrations decrease with distance of transport, Fe solubility would appear to increase with particle age in the atmosphere. For example, in Table 1 African dust samples contain soluble Fe ranging from 6% at Barbados to 26% on the east coast of North America and from 10% in the Mediterranean to 17% farther north in France. Realistic modeling of atmospheric deposition of bioavailable Fe must adequately represent this observed geographical variability of Fe solubility.Note 1–2% of particulate Fe may pass through. As examples of variability, range of solubility is given in parenthesis for each of the ; 3, ; 6,  Noting that measured Fe solubility is small near the deserts where dry deposition dominates, and is larger downwind where wet deposition dominates, . Here we use a global atmospheric model to calculate the soluble fraction of Fe in dry and wet deposition. Unlike  The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory global chemical transport model GCTM driven by NCEP reanalysis is used for this study. The model has 28 vertical sigma levels, equal-area horizontal grids with 265 km resolution, and modules for mineral dust entrainment and deposition. We assume newly entrained dust particles are hydrophobic and are subsequently converted to hydrophilic by gas uptake or cloud processing see below . Hydrophobic particles are removed by ice nucleation and raindrop impaction scavenging; while hydrophilic particles are also removed by droplet nucleation., with the relative magnitude of k N and k S based on laboratory measurements.. Particle scavenging by droplet impaction is based on the cross-section of a spherical particle colliding with a droplet due to the difference in their terminal velocities and on measured collection efficiencies. The rate of cloud processing is proportional to cloud volume fraction f cld in a model grid box that is diagnosed from relative humidity. Here, dependence on SO 2 concentration is neglected. A constant number density of 200 cm −3 and a radius of 10 μm are assumed for the droplets in all non-precipitating clouds. In this simplified treatment an e-folding time for fresh particles of 30 days is obtained at f cld = 0.2.. A wide range of dissolution rates have been measured for iron hydr oxide at low pH <2 and in the presence of light and ligand R d = 10 −11 –10 −10 mol hematite m −2 s −1 . We use R d = 4 × 10 −11 mol m −2 s −1 and A = 100 m 2 g −1 to obtain a good global agreement between model and measured Fe solubility. These values correspond to an e-folding time of 18 days for dissolution. Much slower dissolution rates have been assumed previously. The solubility is calculated as the fraction of iron hydr oxides that has dissolved in the aqueous shell, and has a lower limit of 0.5%.. Wet deposition accounts for 80% and dry deposition 20% of the total soluble Fe input to the ocean, compared to the even partitioning for mineral dust deposition. The mass weighted global average Fe solubility is 17% for wet deposition, and is 4.6% for dry deposition. The solubility for total deposition is 11%, close to the upper limit 10% assumed in current ocean biogeochemistry models, however, we find that the geographic range of Fe solubility is quite large.1994–1998 average; 1 Tg = 10 12 g.. The model thus captures the observed increase of Fe solubility with distance from dust source regions see Table 1 . The September–October data from Barbados and the  Our soluble Fe fluxes, in comparison with those calculated assuming a constant Fe solubility of 5%, are shown in Figure 2 . The positive difference in fluxes is largest around India, downwind of East Asia and Sahel, while the negative difference is largest downwind of Sahara and Patagonia sources Figure 2c . The absolute flux difference is larger in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere, due to more rapid chemical processing by air pollution in the former, and is small in the Southern Ocean. However, the largest relative differences Figure 2d are found in the more remote regions of the central Pacific, Arctic and subarctic, and Indian oceans, reflecting the older age and increased chemical dissolution of Fe since emission. a Annual deposition fluxes μmol m −2 yr −1 of dissolved Fe to the ocean based on our 2-step solubility process. b Annual deposition fluxes of dissolved Fe to the ocean based on a constant 5% solubility. c Difference of fluxes shown in Figures 2a and 2b. d Ratio of fluxes shown in Figures 2a and 2b.. The global primary productivity predicted by ocean models is on the order of 50 PgC/yr, and the global particulate export is estimated at 10 PgC/yr from the surface to the deep ocean. These values indicate that, unlike the major nutrients, re-mineralization of organic matter in the mixed layer does not lead to significant iron recycling., which would be 170 μmol m −2 yr −1 for an Fe:C ratio of 10 μmol/mol. The observed concentration of dissolved Fe in the region is about 0.2 nM on the average. For our model calculated Fe deposition, the residence time of Fe in the surface ocean is estimated to be 0.1–0.2 years at steady state, which is smaller than the modeled mean residence time of 1.3 years based a smaller dust Fe solubility 2% . This large difference in residence time suggests that the ocean models may have under-estimated biological assimilation of Fe and scavenging by mineral dust particles."
202,aerosol,"Diurnal and seasonal variability of rainfall in the sub-Sahel as seen from observations, satellites and a numerical model. Several climatic parameters are observed at the campus of the University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria in sub-Sahel Africa. This climatically important region is in the desert transition zone between the Sahara and the savanna of upper Nigeria and is influenced by the dusty Harmattan wind. It is characterized by persistent conditions with high aerosol loading as well as intense dust outbreaks that affect the local climate. The region is under the influence of the West African Monsoon WAM which has exhibited a dramatic change from wet conditions in the 50s and 60s to much drier conditions in the 70s, 80s and 90s. Observations at the Ilorin site were established to provide the Earth Observing System EOS Community with high quality climatic data, in particular, related to radiative fluxes and aerosols. The station is located in a region with extreme environmental conditions that are not common at other sites around the globe. For example, at Ilorin observed is the highest aerosol optical depth in the AErosol RObotic NETwork AERONET and the site is frequented by biomass burning during the dry season, thus adding new radiative effects to the dust aerosols Pinker et al., 2001; Pandithurai et al., 2001; Holben et al., 2001, Smirnov et al., 2002 . Biomass burning in savanna and forest ecosystems over Africa is believed to contribute about 20% to the global biomass burning. Dynamical models to predict WAM are not accurate in West Africa and tropical Atlantic regions, and are unable to simulate fundamental characteristics of rainfall diurnal, seasonal and annual cycles . In this study we present an analysis of the diurnal and seasonal variability for several years of rainfall observations. Comparison is made with the output of a numerical model and satellite based estimates. It was found that two observed relative peaks in the annual rainfall distribution are seen in the satellite data but are not detected by the numerical model. It was also shown that the satellite data are able to correctly depict diurnal variability. Both the model predictions and the satellite estimates tend to overestimate the rainfall at this site. , rainfall and the intensity of WAM. Several studies present evidence of strong relationship between western Sahelian rainfall and intense hurricane activity in the Atlantic basin. It has been also stated that dust plays an important role in climate forcing. Prospero and Lamb  The most recent 31 days of daily estimates at 0.25 degree lat/lon resolution can be obtained from ftp://ftpprd.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/precip/global_CMORPH/daily_025deg/ . The archived daily 0.25 degree data from December 1st, 2002 to December 2004 were provided by R. Joyce private communication, 2005 . Information is also available at 3-hourly intervals averaged for three months; more recently, 3-hourly estimates at 0.25 deg lat/lon dating back to December 2002, located at ftp://ftpprd.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/precip/global_CMORPH/3-hourly_025deg. Version II was used. The average monthly data are calculated for all the four grids and the average data at Ilorin are derived from a linear interpolation of the four center points. The weight of each point is decided by its distance to Ilorin. Since the unit of the model data is kg/m 2 /sec, it has to be converted to mm/day. The conversion formula used is: , below 10°N the principal maximum is in early summer, a relative minimum in mid-summer, and a secondary maximum in late summer. Such rainfall distribution is related to the northward shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone ITCZ from 5 to 10°N around the 24th of June which withdraws back in the second half of the summer. Therefore, there is one monsoon above 10°N and double monsoon below 10°N. It is also evident from Figure 2 that the two driest months are December and January, with almost no rainfall. In Figure 3 presented is a comparison of the data from the various sources, for periods for which data were available for at least from two sources. The matching was done between the ground station and one grid cell of model or satellite output that included Ilorin. The daily CMORPH product was used here. A comparison was done between the ground station and the average of four satellite grid cells. The satellite estimates are larger when four grid points are averaged. For 1999, the maximum is about 24 mm/day, and it is 10, 15, 12, 13 and 10 for subsequent years, respectively. Most likely this is due to the fact that grid cells below Ilorin might receive more rain than the grids centered at the ground site. Yet, the main features of the model and satellite results are maintained at both averaging modes. As evident, the NCEP model does not detect the bi-modality of the rainfall while the CMORPH product detects it correctly in time and relative magnitude. A possible explanation for this can be found in the work of Le Barbé and Lebel  It is of interest to compare the diurnal variability of these products. Initially comparison was done with a three month average hourly product, namely, for the four seasons. To facilitate a comparison with such product, the ground observations were averaged to match the satellite data. A comparison for two seasons when no data were missing in any of the two products is presented in Figure 4 . As evident, the satellite product tracks well the diurnal variability of the observed rainfall being on the higher side . Subsequently, three hourly data from CMORPH became available. We have selected the following two rainy periods: 1 June 11 to June 30, 2003 and 2 September 9 to September 28, 2004 Table 1 . The satellite product depicted very closely the diurnal variability during all seasons not shown .Diurnal variation of rainfall from ground observations squares and from CMORPH circles averaged for a three month period.. The agriculture in the Sudano-Sahelian zone depends not only on the onset, duration and intensity of the wet season, but also on the intra-seasonal rainfall distribution. Using the SARRAH crop model for millet, it was shown that information on the onset date of the summer monsoon might contribute to a better choice of the sowing date and result in better yields. that satellites overestimate precipitation over land, particularly in semi-arid regions where rainfall evaporates significantly on its journey to the surface. it is hoped to link observations, data analysis and models on a wide range of space and time scales so that weather forecasts used for sub-seasonal to decadal prediction will be improved as well as models used for simulations of the West African climate and those used for predicting scenarios of future climate change. The observations at the Ilorin site should be useful in such efforts. Moreover, they also serve the local community, by providing research opportunities for graduate students, and local scientists."
203,ocean,"Trends in aerosol nutrient solubility along a west-east transect of the Saharan dust plume. Simple leaching protocols have been used to examine trends in the solubility of aerosol nutrients Fe, P and Si along a west - east transect through the Saharan dust plume German SOLAS cruise M55 and between Saharan and southern hemisphere-origin aerosols. Solubilities were in the range 0.5 - 7.9% for Fe, 2.3 - 67% for P and 0.02 - 1.1% for Si, with lower values corresponding to samples of Saharan origin. Previous laboratory studies have suggested that aerosol Fe solubility might be enhanced by acid- and/or photo-chemistry during transport through the atmosphere, but only the solubility of P was observed to be higher at the western end of the transect than the eastern. This implies that if photo chemical processing of aerosol Fe occurs in the atmosphere, significant enhancement of Fe solubility requires longer than the 5 - 10 days associated with transport of Saharan dust across the tropical Atlantic Ocean. . In the cases of Fe, P and Si, but not N, significant portions of the aerosol nutrient content are insoluble and thus probably unavailable to marine biota. Saharan dust, which can be transported thousands of kilometres across the Atlantic, contributes very large quantities of Fe, P and Si to the oligotrophic North Atlantic gyre, and may play a significant role in stimulating primary production by nitrogen fixing organisms there., particularly in desert dust aerosol. A number of laboratory studies have indicated that Fe solubility may be enhanced by chemical/photochemical processing of dust particles during transport through the atmosphere. Mineral phosphorus in dust exists chiefly in the form of apatites Ca 5 PO 4 3 X, X = F, OH, Cl , minerals with extremely low solubilities. Biomass burning and primary organic matter also contribute to the aerosol P pool. Little data is available on the solubility of P in atmospheric aerosols, but P solubility appears to lie in the range 10–87%, with solubility in Saharan-origin aerosols being at the low end of this range. Direct comparison of the various reported solubility values for aerosol Fe and P is hampered by, amongst other things, the use of different solvents e.g., weak acid buffers, deionised water, seawater which will influence the soluble fractions obtained to greater or lesser extents. Recent studies on the atmospheric input of Si to the oceans have assumed a solubility in the range 5–10%, based on data obtained from kinetic studies of the dissolution of the mineral albite NaAlSi 3 O 8 . We are not aware of any studies that examine the solubility of Si in aerosol directly., and we include aerosol Al and Mn solubility data for comparison with our results from other regions of the Atlantic. We use simple leaching protocols to investigate whether atmospheric processing has a significant effect on aerosol nutrient solubility over the spatial/temporal scales associated with transport of Saharan dust across the Atlantic Ocean. We emphasise however that these leaching protocols do not directly reproduce the solubility behaviour of aerosols on deposition to seawater, as discussed by and  Soluble and total Fe and other TM including Al and Mn concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma – optical emission spectrometry in separate portions of the TM aerosol filters using an ammonium acetate leach pH 4.7 and a strong acid HNO 3 /HF digestion procedure. Total P concentrations were determined by high resolution – inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry also in the strong acid TM digests. Full analytical details for these techniques are given by . using the spectrophotometric methods described by . The seasalt ss and non-seasalt nss components of aerosol major ion concentrations were calculated using Na as an indicator of aerosol sea spray content. Net aerosol acidity was estimated by calculating the difference between the total acidic 2 × nss SO 4 2− + NO 3 − + 2 × C 2 O 4 2− and alkaline NH 4 + + 2 × nss Ca 2+ + ss HCO 3 − species concentrations. The percentage solubility Sol x , X = Fe, P, Si, Al or Mn was calculated as: where X sol and X total are the soluble and total atmospheric concentrations of each component. Air mass back trajectories were obtained from the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory HYSPLIT model, FNL data set . and gas-phase and aerosol chemistry. Orange/brown Saharan dust was evident on the collection filters of all samples which had air mass arrivals from the northern hemisphere, and was absent from samples whose air masses originated in the South Atlantic. Percentage solubility values for bulk aerosol are summarised in Table 2 , and illustrated for fine and coarse mode solubility in Saharan aerosols in Figure 2 . Overall the solubility estimates obtained for M55 Table 2 were in very good agreement with results reported for similar Saharan and South Atlantic origin aerosols collected during meridional transects of the Atlantic Ocean, and indicate that the solubility of Fe, P, Si and Al in aerosols from the region of the South Atlantic sampled during M55 is higher than their solubility in Saharan aerosols by a factor of 2 or more.  Chemical and photochemical processes in the atmosphere have been hypothesised to increase the solubility of Fe in aerosol. The length of time available for atmospheric processing of Saharan dust aerosol increases as the dust is transported to the west and hence, a gradient in Fe solubility, with higher solubility in the west, might be expected with longitude along the M55 transect. A similar trend in the percentage of total aerosol Fe present as ferrozine-leachable Fe II at pH 4.2 has previously been observed during a cruise leg between the Cape Verde Islands and Barbados. During M55 however, there was no significant trend in the solubility of Fe in fine or coarse mode aerosol with longitude Figure 2 . This was also the case for Si solubility, but for P there were significant increases in solubility with increasing longitude in both size fractions Sol P,f/c = a f/c * Long °E + b f/c : a f = −0.26, b f = 3.1, r f 2 = 0.26; a c = −0.15, b c = 1.3, r c 2 = 0.39; where subscripts f and c refer to fine and coarse modes respectively, both p < 0.05 . Mineral P dissolution may be enhanced at higher acid concentrations e.g., Ca 5 PO 4 3 X + 3H + = 5Ca 2+ + 3HPO 4 − + X − , but there were no statistically significant correlations between Sol P and aerosol acid species nss SO 4 2− , NO 3 − , oxalate concentrations or net aerosol acidity, so the cause of the observed increase in Sol P during transport is not readily apparent from our data. The solubility of Si was also not correlated to any of these parameters, and nor was Sol Fe , which is consistent with results for Sol Fe reported previously. In a recent modelling study into the effects of atmospheric processing on aerosol Fe solubility, , using a similar, but not directly comparable, aerosol Fe extraction method pH 4.2, addition of ferrozine to that employed in our study. These longitudinal patterns in Fe II and Sol Fe this work may indicate that soluble aerosol Fe is reduced to the ferrous form during atmospheric transport across the Atlantic, probably through photochemical reduction, but that the overall fraction of soluble Fe is unaffected by atmospheric processing on this timescale 5–10 days . Aerosol P solubility does appear to increase during transport of Saharan dust across the Atlantic, but again no relationship between Sol P and acid species concentrations was observed.."
204,dust,"Possible influences of Asian dust aerosols on cloud properties and radiative forcing observed from MODIS and CERES. The effects of dust storms on cloud properties and Radiative Forcing RF are analyzed over Northwestern China from April 2001 to June 2004 using data collected by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System CERES instruments on the Aqua and Terra satellites. On average, ice cloud effective particle diameter, optical depth and ice water path of cirrus clouds under dust polluted conditions are 11%, 32.8%, and 42% less, respectively, than those derived from ice clouds in dust-free atmospheric environments. Due to changes in cloud microphysics, the instantaneous net RF is increased from -161.6 W/m 2 for dust-free clouds to -118.6 W/m 2 for dust-contaminated clouds. . In addition, the aerosols can affect the radiative heating structure of the atmosphere, thereby changing the clouds and atmospheric general circulation.. .. The retrieved cloud properties include cloud effective droplet radius r e or ice crystal diameter De , optical depth τ , effective cloud temperature Te , and water path WP . Cloud WP retrievals are calculated from the cloud optical depth and effective particle size estimated from the VISST. Flux measurements from CERES are used to estimate the instantaneous RF. The CERES instruments measure broadband radiances at the Top-Of-Atmosphere TOA in three spectral regions 0.2–5.0 μm; 8–14 μm; 5–100 μm at a spatial resolution of about 20 km at nadir. The CERES Meteorological, Ozone, and Aerosol MOA data are used to analyze meteorological conditions. showed that the brightness temperature BT difference between the 11 and 12 μm channels T45 is negative for dust because dust layers have a higher emissivity at 12 μm than at 11 μm. The BT difference is affected not only by the dust optical thickness, but by the type of dust and the particular characteristics of the 11 and 12-μm channels. In a detailed case study,  To detect cloud modifications induced by dust aerosols, four regions are selected to represent the dusts and clouds in different environments. Box 1 hereafter DUST in Figure 1b represents the cloud-free dust region. Box 2 hereafter, CLD denotes an area where clouds occurred in a dust-free atmosphere. Box 3 hereafter, PCOD includes partial clouds in a dusty region. The clouds in the PCOD region are actually solid-deck clouds although they do not fully cover the whole PCOD region. Box 4 hereafter, COD represents overcast clouds in dusty conditions. The CLD and COD regions are selected based on observations from 701 surface meteorological stations in China and Mongolia. The surface stations report dust in four categories: dust storm, wind-blown sand, floating dust, and no-dust. For a cloud region observed by satellite, if the surface observation is no-dust, this region is defined as CLD, and if the surface observation is dust storm, this region is defined as COD. Table 1 shows the information for the ten carefully selected dust storm cases used in this study.  Figure 3 shows the mean and standard error of the cloud properties in the CLD and COD regions as a function of T e . The standard error gives a rough measure of the variability of the means. Figure 3 shows that the standard errors are quite small for all three properties in all T e bins. To further evaluate the statistical significance, we also calculated the t-test for each T e bin. For all three cloud properties De, τ and WP , the mean differences are significant at the 95% level in all T e bins except two indicated constant or increased cloud liquid WP associated with high aerosol concentrations for water clouds over oceans. Current results suggest a different effect of dust aerosols on relatively dry upper-level air masses, high clouds, and ice cloud condensation over arid or semi-arid regions. The key issue may be related to the semi-direct effect or cloud evaporation. As dust aerosols cool the Earth's surface and heat the aerosol layer, the atmospheric stability within and above the boundary layer is reduced, resulting in enhanced vertical motion and increased airborne dust. Additionally, dust aerosols can cause evaporation of cloud droplets semi-direct effect . This leads to reduced cloud water path and affects the RF. However, in terms of meteorological states, the clouds in dusty regions are drier Table 2 and cloud top warmer Figure 2d than those in non-dusty regions, the comparison between De in dusty and non-dusty regions is not under the exactly same conditions. From in-situ observations, effective ice crystal sizes are generally larger in warmer conditions than those in colder environments. Thus, we attribute the size change i.e., reducing cloud particle size in dusty regions to the drier conditions. The dehydration process of wet dust precipitation may be one of the possible candidates causing dry conditions. Another obvious factor, causing dry conditions, can be the air mass source of the dust clouds. The dust layers in the source regions are likely to have dry air masses. In this case, the impact of dust aerosols on RF becomes very complex. Since the PCOD, COD and CLD regions in each case are determined from the same synoptic weather system, the meteorological conditions for these regions are assumed to be similar. The differences in radiative properties such as radiative fluxes, optical depth and particle size are considered as dust effects. For DUST regions, the dust aerosol has a cooling effect at the TOA in daytime and net warming when both day and night are considered. These aerosols also cancel or reduce the cloud cooling effect at the TOA in PCOD and COD regions due to decreasing water path. If confirmed, the net RF 0.4 W/m 2 of dust storms estimated from the current study will be the strongest aerosol forcing in the studied region during dust storm seasons, and have profound warming influences on the atmospheric general circulation and climate."
205,particles aerosol,"Simulation of high-spectral-resolution infrared signature of overlapping cirrus clouds and mineral dust. Numerical simulations have been carried out to understand the effects of overlapping cirrus clouds and mineral dust on the high-spectral-resolution infrared spectrum in the 600-2400 cm -1 region. A combination of the discrete ordinates radiative transfer and line-by-line models that account for the multiple scattering and monochromatic molecular absorption in the atmosphere is utilized to simulate the down-looking infrared spectrum at the top of the atmosphere with a resolution of 0.2 cm -1 . It is demonstrated that the spectral slope of the infrared radiance in the 800-1000 cm -1 region can be used to discriminate coexisting cirrus-dust scenes from those associated only with cirrus clouds or dust alone. In a case for a cirrus cloud overlapping with a dust layer, the spectral features in the 1100-1200 cm -1 and 1400-1850 cm -1 regions can be potentially useful for retrieving the optical thicknesses of the dust layer and cirrus cloud, respectively. , and dust, a dominant feature of the global aerosol system, play important roles in the Earth's climate system. Numerous techniques based on the infrared radiative spectrum for retrieving the properties of cirrus clouds have been explored. However, for the retrieval of dust, many existing algorithms utilize the solar spectral bands, although the narrowband infrared observations have also been utilized to retrieve dust properties. Sokolik  The intent of our study is to understand the effects of overlapping cirrus clouds and mineral dust on the high-spectral-resolution infrared spectrum in the 600–2400 cm −1 region, a spectral region covered by many spaceborne or airborne infrared spectrometric instruments, for example, AIRS, the Scanning High-resolution Interferometer Sounder S-HIS , HIS, and the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System NPOESS Airborne Sounder Testbed-Interferometer NAST-I ., implemented with 16 streams in conjunction with a line-by-line LBL model, is employed to simulate the down-looking infrared spectrum in the 600–2400 cm −1 16.67–4.17 μm region with a spectral resolution of 0.2 cm −1 . The optical thicknesses of atmospheric layers, pertaining to the atmospheric molecular absorption, are calculated from the LBL model on the basis of the U.S. 1976 standard atmospheric profile. The emissivity of the surface is assumed as 1 in the present radiative transfer simulations.. The size distribution of dust particles is assumed to consist of three size modes specified in terms of lognormal functions. Furthermore, the Lorenz-Mie theory is employed to compute the bulk extinction coefficient, single-scattering albedo and phase function of aerosol particles with a certain size distribution. The optical properties of realistic dust aerosols may differ from the model simulation because of the nonsphericity and complicated composition of dust particles. for the single-scattering properties of various ice crystal habits. The effective diameter and visible optical thickness of the cirrus cloud defined for the present simulations are assumed as 30 μm and 0.5, respectively., other interesting features can be noticed from Figure 1 . A spectral folding near 945 cm −1 is noted, which is resulted from a positive spectral slope in the 910–945 cm −1 region and a negative spectral slope in the 945–1000 cm −1 region. Moreover, in the spectral proximity of the 945-cm −1 wave number, the overall variation patterns of the two spectral segments corresponding to the positive and negative slopes are nearly symmetric although the absolute values of the positive slopes are slightly smaller than those of the corresponding negative slopes.Simulated nadir-viewed spectral brightness temperatures at the top of atmosphere as a function of wave number for three effective particle sizes D e = 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0 μm in conjunction with an optical thickness of τ = 3.0 and three values of optical depth τ = 1.0, 3.0, or 5.0 in conjunction with an effective diameter of D e = 4.0 μm .  Sokolik  The spectral characteristics discussed in the preceding context can be used to detect the co-presence of cirrus clouds and mineral dust. Specifically, the infrared spectral signature of cirrus clouds contaminated by underlying mineral dust that has an optical thickness larger than that of the overlying cirrus clouds can be detected by using the spectral folding due to the positive and negative slopes in the 910–945 cm −1 and 945–1000 cm −1 regions, respectively note that the magnitude of the positive slope is slightly larger than that of the negative slope . Additionally, the spectral feature that the slope in the 800–910 cm −1 region is positive when a cirrus cloud and a dust layer coexist can also be useful. and also the properties of dust. As cirrus clouds and dust often coexist, it is a natural progression of the previous studies to explore whether the properties of cirrus clouds overlying mineral dust can be inferred from the infrared measurements. It is evident from Figure 2 that the characteristics of the spectral slopes in the 800–1000 cm −1 region provide quite useful information for differentiating cirrus clouds and mineral dust. In the 1100–1200 cm −1 region, the positive slope is sensitive primarily to the optical thickness of the underlying mineral dust, and the information about this spectral segment can be used to retrieve the optical thickness of a dust layer overlaid by a thin cirrus cloud. The infrared spectral signature in the 1400–1850 cm −1 region is sensitive primarily to the optical thickness of cirrus clouds contaminated by underlying mineral dust Figure 2c . Furthermore, in this study it is also found that infrared brightness temperatures in the 1400–1850 cm −1 region are essentially insensitive to the effective sizes of the clouds. Thus, this spectral segment can be useful for retrieving the optical thickness of a cirrus cloud with or without the contamination of underlying dust. The effects of cirrus clouds and mineral dust on the high-spectral resolution infrared radiative signatures have been investigated separately and also under their coexisting conditions. The different spectral features are noticed in the 800–1000 cm −1 and 1100–1200 cm −1 spectral regions for cirrus clouds and dust. It has been shown that the infrared spectral signature of cirrus clouds contaminated by underlying mineral dust is quite unique as compared with those for only cirrus clouds or mineral dust alone. The underlying mineral dust diminishes the positive slope in the 800–910 cm −1 region and enhances the positive slope in the 910–945 cm −1 region. The effect of dust results in a negative slope in the 945–1000 cm −1 region and a positive slope in the 1100–1200 cm −1 region. These spectral features can be used to discriminate the infrared spectra pertaining to coexisting cirrus clouds and mineral dust from those associated only with cirrus clouds or mineral dust alone. It has also been found that, under coexisting cirrus cloud and mineral dust conditions, the slope in the 1100–1200 cm −1 region is predominantly sensitive to the optical thickness of mineral dust, and the brightness temperature depressions in the 1400–1850 cm −1 region are sensitive to the optical thickness of cirrus clouds. Thus, it is feasible to use these two spectral segments to retrieve the optical thicknesses of cirrus clouds and underlying mineral dust. The follow-up effort of the present study will be focused on analyzing the AIRS or NAST-I measurements under three conditions cirrus only, dust only, and coexisting cirrus and dust over the typical dust regions."
206,aerosol,"Infrared dust spectral signatures from AIRS. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder AIRS on board NASA's Aqua satellite platform is a hypersectral IR temperature and humidity sounder for numerical weather prediction and climate change studies. We use the rich spectral information available in the AIRS thermal infrared radiances to study the spectral signatures of dust over ocean for four case studies, and to retrieve dust optical depths using a fast two-stream radiative transfer model. Retrieved optical depths for one case, a dust storm spreading over the Eastern Mediterranean in October 2002, are compared with visible imagery and MODIS optical depth retrievals. This work represents a preliminary step to removing the effects of dust on the retrieval of temperature and water vapor from the AIRS measurements. . Dust storms can also affect atmospheric chemistry and rainfall patterns, and transport micronutrients and microorganisms. The deposited dust can kill coral, fertilize ocean photoplankton which absorb more CO2, or melt ice as dust makes that surface absorb rather than reflect sunlight. Dust storms are now more frequent, in part because of climatic variability and in part because of land use change such as deforestation or overgrazing. instrument was designed to provide improved temperature and humidity profiles for numerical weather prediction and long-term climate studies. However, the effects of dust on measured AIRS radiances can negatively impact the retrievals of these profiles. With an almost complete high-spectral coverage of the 9–12 μm atmospheric window spectrum, AIRS radiances contain much information about clouds and aerosols, allowing the retrieval of infrared IR optical depths τ ν of mineral dust as well as possibly correcting for dust in the retrieval algorithm. absorb less at the 800 and 1200 cm −1 regions than at 960 cm −1 , yielding a “V” shaped depression of the Brightness Temperature BT across the thermal IR window. By testing for this, AIRS spectral data can be queried for dust contamination day or night. Examination of atmospheric parameters retrieved from contaminated fields of view FOVs shows that dust negatively impacts the retrievals, degrading the use of AIRS in weather forecasting over the vast regions that dust can spread into.. The dust is indicated by bias values coded in red to green. The nominal AIRS noise level is coded in white. AIRS radiances clearly measure the immense extent and variability of dust carried by the atmosphere across the Atlantic , coinciding in time and space with the breeding ground for hurricanes, when satellite observations are critical for weather forecasting. To that end, this paper shows that the adverse effects of dust can be accounted for in the retrieval radiative transfer algorithm, and possibly removed from the AIRS radiances. AIRS observations can also be used to estimate the change in outgoing longwave radiative flux OLR at the top of the atmosphere TOA that impacts the Earth's radiation budget.BTD bias differences between AIRS channels at 961 and 1231 cm −1 , for July 2003, for FOVS passing a stringent uniformity test. The plot shows the long range transport of Saharan Dust across the Atlantic. Using the retrieved atmospheric fields from these contaminated FOVs could lead to erroneous weather forecasting during the hurricane season.. Here we analyze the detailed AIRS spectral information from multiple spectra, using a fast scattering radiative transfer algorithm to retrieve dust thermal IR optical depths. The scattering code is based on the two-stream approximation, and makes use of the refractive indices of a “Sahara dust” model. Our dust retrieval attempts to minimize the obs-calc BTD biases of channels in the thermal IR window channels. Some of these channels are used by the retrieval algorithms at various Numerical Weather Prediction centers, so an ability to correct for dust effects may allow for more reliable retrievals.. AIRS has 2378 channels, covering the spectral range 649–1136, 1217–1613, 2181–2665 cm −1 .

Note the close match between the pattern shown by the IR retrieval and that in Figure 2 .

All show the “V” shaped depression in the 800–1200 cm −1 region, characteristic of a silicate absorber. Note the notch feature between 860 and 880 cm −1 is strongest in curves b and c and almost absent from curves a and d. Optical depth retrievals of thermal IR data from AIRS radiances show good correlation with retrieved MODIS optical depths. A careful use of the rich spectral information available in the AIRS thermal IR channels shows the worldwide extent of dust contamination, and makes possible day and night retrievals which significantly reduce BTD biases across the thermal IR window. This should improve current AIRS retrievals that can be negatively affected by the presence of dust. Residual biases show that a more accurate refractive index model should be used, possibly including a carbonate species. Continuation of this research should yield a quality assurance dust flag for use with AIRS retrievals as well as possible removal of the effects of the dust before the cloud clearing stage."
207,aerosol,"Impact of particulate organic matter on the relative humidity dependence of light scattering: A simplified parameterization. Measurements during recent field campaigns downwind the Indian subcontinent, Asia, and the northeastern United States reveal a substantial decrease in the relative humidity dependence of light scattering, f sigma sp RH , with increasing mass fraction of particulate organic matter POM for submicrometer aerosol. Using data from INDOEX INDian Ocean EXperiment , ACE Asia Aerosol Characterization Experiment - Asia , and ICARTT International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation , we have identified, within measurement limitations, the impact of POM on the f sigma sp RH of accumulation mode sulfate-POM mixtures. The result is a parameterization that quantifies the POM mass fraction - f sigma sp RH relationship for use in radiative transfer and air quality models either as input or as validation. The parameterization is valid where the aerosol consists of an internally mixed sulfate-carbonaceous accumulation mode and other externally mixed components e.g. sea salt, dust and is applicable on both global and regional scales. . However, both laboratory and field measurements indicate that POM that is internally mixed with water soluble salts can reduce the particles' hygroscopic response, which decreases their water content and their ability to scatter light at elevated relative humidities. The complexity of the composition of POM and its impact on aerosol optical properties requires the development of simplifying parameterizations that allow for the incorporation of information derived from field measurements into calculations of DCF and visibility.; ; ; ; ICARTT CP i Scanning RH TSI neph. AMS j . We express f σsp RH in terms of γ s as shown in Equation 2 as this allows the parameterization to be applied to a broader range of RH values. Here, γ s is based on RH ref = 40% and RH = 85%. The use of this equation assumes that all particles are deliquesced. . Organic carbon μg C m −3 was determined with a thermo-optical method and multiplied by a factor of 1.4 or 1.6 to convert to POM. On other platforms, submicrometer diameter non-refractory NR SO 4 = , NH 4 + , NO 3 − , and POM were measured with an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer AMS . Here, NR refers to any species that volatilizes at ∼550°C. The AMS data from all experiments were compared to other instruments to correct for collection efficiencies less than unity Table 1 . The AMS also yields information about the degree of oxidation of the POM based on the fraction of the total POM at mass/charge m/z 44 or the m44/POM ratio. The peak at m/z 44 occurs in the mass spectra of heavily oxidized organic species such as di- and poly carboxylic acids.  Comparisons between f σsp RH derived from measurements TSI scanning RH nephelometer and Mie light scattering model calculations show agreement for NaCl and NH 4 2 SO 4 within 10%. Likewise, RHB measurements of f σsp RH at high RH during ACE Asia from TSI and Radiance Research scanning RH nephelometers demonstrated agreement within 10% for all air mass. Direct comparisons of f σsp RH from co-located platforms C-130, RHB, Gosan during ACE Asia revealed differences of 10 to 30%. Based on these results, the overall uncertainty when comparing measurements of f σsp RH from the three field experiments ranges between 10 and 30%. For f σsp 85, 40 , a 10 to 30% change in f σsp RH corresponds to a 0.08 to 0.2 change in γ s . Hence, the linear fits shown in Figure 1 are not significantly different when compared to the overall uncertainty. Merging the ACE Asia and ICARTT data sets and normalizing so that they are weighted equally yields the following single parameterization between γ s and F O . INDOEX was not included in 7 due to the few data points available and the limited range of F o over which the measurements were made.  During ICARTT, RHB encountered continental air masses that left shore and reached the ship with no additional input of urban, industrial, or terrestrial aerosol source material. The shallow stable marine boundary layer minimized mixing from aloft and input of sulfur and POM from the ocean to the marine boundary layer was negligible given the low wind speeds. Under these conditions, the molar ratio of particulate SO 4 = to total sulfur SO 4 = + gas phase SO 2 can be used as an indicator of the relative age of the sampled aerosol. Relatively young aerosol has a low SO 4 = / SO 4 = + SO 2 ratio due to insufficient time for conversion of SO 2 to SO 4 = via gas and aqueous phase oxidation processes. As the aerosol ages and more SO 2 is converted to SO 4 = , the ratio increases. A comparison of SO 4 = / SO 4 = + SO 2 to the acidity of the aerosol and the degree of oxidation of the organics suggests that aerosol age determines aerosol chemical composition and, hence, the slope and y-intercept of the F O − γ s relationship. Using a photochemical age calculated from measured toluene to benzene ratios yields a similar result but goes beyond the analysis presented in this paper.  Measurements made downwind of the Indian subcontinent, Asia, and northeastern U.S. all reveal a common trend of decreasing f σsp RH with increasing mass fraction of POM. Highest values of f σsp RH corresponded to relatively old aerosol that was acidic, had a low POM mass fraction, and a high degree of oxidation of the existing POM. In contrast, lowest values of f σsp RH corresponded to younger, more neutralized aerosol that had a higher POM mass fraction containing less oxidized material. Aerosol aging and the resulting chemical processing of the aerosol significantly impact f σsp RH of sulfate-POM mixtures. [14]  Based on these data, a relationship between f σsp RH and the POM mass fraction has been quantified for accumulation mode sulfate-POM aerosol. This simplified parameterization may be used as input to RTMs to derive values of f σsp RH based on CTM estimates of the POM mass fraction. Alternatively, the relationship may be used to assess values of f σsp RH currently being employed in RTMs. Similarly, the parameterization may be used in air quality forecast models. Continued simultaneous measurements of f σsp RH and aerosol composition at different regions and times of year and the exploration of factors beyond F O , acidity, and oxidation of the POM will improve the parameterizations presented here.. Organic carbon μg C m −3 was determined with a thermo-optical method and multiplied by a factor of 1.4 or 1.6 to convert to POM. On other platforms, submicrometer diameter non-refractory NR SO 4 = , NH 4 + , NO 3 − , and POM were measured with an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer AMS . Here, NR refers to any species that volatilizes at ∼550°C. The AMS data from all experiments were compared to other instruments to correct for collection efficiencies less than unity Table 1 . The AMS also yields information about the degree of oxidation of the POM based on the fraction of the total POM at mass/charge m/z 44 or the m44/POM ratio. The peak at m/z 44 occurs in the mass spectra of heavily oxidized organic species such as di- and poly carboxylic acids. Comparisons between f σsp RH derived from measurements TSI scanning RH nephelometer and Mie light scattering model calculations show agreement for NaCl and NH 4 2 SO 4 within 10%. Likewise, RHB measurements of f σsp RH at high RH during ACE Asia from TSI and Radiance Research scanning RH nephelometers demonstrated agreement within 10% for all air mass. Direct comparisons of f σsp RH from co-located platforms C-130, RHB, Gosan during ACE Asia revealed differences of 10 to 30%. Based on these results, the overall uncertainty when comparing measurements of f σsp RH from the three field experiments ranges between 10 and 30%. For f σsp 85, 40 , a 10 to 30% change in f σsp RH corresponds to a 0.08 to 0.2 change in γ s . Hence, the linear fits shown in Figure 1 are not significantly different when compared to the overall uncertainty. Merging the ACE Asia and ICARTT data sets and normalizing so that they are weighted equally yields the following single parameterization between γ s and F O . INDOEX was not included in 7 due to the few data points available and the limited range of F o over which the measurements were made. During ICARTT, RHB encountered continental air masses that left shore and reached the ship with no additional input of urban, industrial, or terrestrial aerosol source material. The shallow stable marine boundary layer minimized mixing from aloft and input of sulfur and POM from the ocean to the marine boundary layer was negligible given the low wind speeds. Under these conditions, the molar ratio of particulate SO 4 = to total sulfur SO 4 = + gas phase SO 2 can be used as an indicator of the relative age of the sampled aerosol. Relatively young aerosol has a low SO 4 = / SO 4 = + SO 2 ratio due to insufficient time for conversion of SO 2 to SO 4 = via gas and aqueous phase oxidation processes. As the aerosol ages and more SO 2 is converted to SO 4 = , the ratio increases. A comparison of SO 4 = / SO 4 = + SO 2 to the acidity of the aerosol and the degree of oxidation of the organics suggests that aerosol age determines aerosol chemical composition and, hence, the slope and y-intercept of the F O − γ s relationship. Using a photochemical age calculated from measured toluene to benzene ratios yields a similar result but goes beyond the analysis presented in this paper. Measurements made downwind of the Indian subcontinent, Asia, and northeastern U.S. all reveal a common trend of decreasing f σsp RH with increasing mass fraction of POM. Highest values of f σsp RH corresponded to relatively old aerosol that was acidic, had a low POM mass fraction, and a high degree of oxidation of the existing POM. In contrast, lowest values of f σsp RH corresponded to younger, more neutralized aerosol that had a higher POM mass fraction containing less oxidized material. Aerosol aging and the resulting chemical processing of the aerosol significantly impact f σsp RH of sulfate-POM mixtures.[14]  Based on these data, a relationship between f σsp RH and the POM mass fraction has been quantified for accumulation mode sulfate-POM aerosol. This simplified parameterization may be used as input to RTMs to derive values of f σsp RH based on CTM estimates of the POM mass fraction. Alternatively, the relationship may be used to assess values of f σsp RH currently being employed in RTMs. Similarly, the parameterization may be used in air quality forecast models. Continued simultaneous measurements of f σsp RH and aerosol composition at different regions and times of year and the exploration of factors beyond F O , acidity, and oxidation of the POM will improve the parameterizations presented here."
208,particles atmosphere,"Morphological and chemical modification of mineral dust: Observational insight into the heterogeneous uptake of acidic gases. Aerosol samples were collected in the urban atmosphere of Beijing, China, by deploying a tethered balloon. Coarse particles d > 1 mu m were individually analyzed using electron microscopes, to investigate the extent of dust modification by acidic gases in the atmosphere. Based on the elemental composition, irregularly shaped mineral dust was separated into carbonate and silicate groups. Both sulfate and nitrate were found to accumulate on carbonate more readily than silicate particles. Interestingly, spherical particles resembling Ca-carbonate in composition were spotted frequently in the samples. These Ca-rich spherical particles were more abundant under humid conditions, suggesting that they are deliquesced carbonate particles that formed in the atmosphere following the uptake of acidic gases. Sulfate and nitrate were more frequently detected in the Ca-rich spherical particles than in carbonate in the original solid form, indicating that the gas uptake efficiency of carbonate is further enhanced after the phase transition. . The formation of such soluble substances may change dust into efficient CCN, affecting cloud and precipitation patterns. The expected aerosol cooling effect of the secondary sulfates may be reduced, due to the partitioning of precursor SO 2 on mineral dust. Thus, the chemical modification of dust has significant implications on the hydrological and geochemical cycles, which in turn affects the climate.. Laboratory studies suggest increased uptake coefficients of HNO 3 , NO 2 , and SO 2 gases on mineral dust under higher relative humidity which determines the amount of water associated with the particles . Thus, to accumulate the comparable cases under various atmospheric conditions, observations should preferably be made in more stationary air with a constant supply of dust and pollution, such as in the urban boundary layer.. However, the actual atmosphere is a melting pot where the simultaneous uptake of various gases takes place on different aerosol types. Our previous report failed to describe how nitrate competes with sulfate on individual dust particles, alongside other reactive particles such as sea salts. The sampling and analytical procedures are basically identical to those described in detail by . Particle-laden grids were retrieved and exposed to octanol vapor for 12 hours. The octanol treatment is needed for a needle-like crystal nitron-nitrate to deposit only around each particle containing nitrate, enabling visual detection of the nitrate. Particles were then individually imaged under transmission/scanning electron microscopes to determine their morphologies TEM, JEOL JEM-2010, and SEM, HITACHI, S-3000N . The elemental composition of each particle was measured using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer EDX, HORIBA, EMAX-500 coupled with the SEM. The X-ray spectrometer allows semi-quantitative analysis, allowing observation of a relative abundance of elements contained in a single particle. The relative concentration of elements heavier than Na Z > 11 was estimated based on the X-ray spectrum acquired after scanning an electron beam over each particle for 40 s of live time with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV at the beam current of 0.2 nA., although a significant fraction of the dust may originate from various anthropogenic sources such as roads and construction sites. Based on the analysis of individual particles, irregularly shaped mineral dust particles were separated into two large groups. Those having elemental ratios of Ca > 50% or Mg + Ca > 50% are termed “carbonate” mostly calcite including dolomite , and the rest, “silicate” mostly clay and mica, including quartz, feldspars, etc. because these are generally the two dominant atmospheric mineral species found in the region. Silicate is enriched in Al and Si and often includes minor fractions of other metals Na, Mg, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe . The fractions of particles containing sulfur detected using EDX and nitrate detected using nitron film in each mineral group are compared in Figure 2 . The particles classified as sea salt, and Ca-rich spherical particles were also included in Figure 2 for better comparison. More reactive species are expected to contain sulfur and nitrate in greater fractions. Sea salt had the largest fraction 0.95/0.83 of particles containing sulfur and nitrate, followed by Ca-rich spherical particles 0.78/0.78 , carbonate 0.61/0.53 , and silicate 0.48/0.30 . Note that a sea salt particle originally contains sulfur. A fresh sea salt particle is expected to have S/Na and Cl/Na elemental ratios of 0.08 and 1.17, similar to that found in sea water. However, the average ratio in the current study was 0.41 and 0.06, which indicates that much of the sulfur detected in the sea salt was excess sulfur accumulated upon Cl-liberation.Fraction of particles containing sulfur/nitrate in respective particle classes. Total particles found in four samples Table 1 is shown in brackets.. Nitrate also favors carbonate than silicate, as shown in Figure 2 , indicating that the uptake of acidic gases depends on the dust mineralogy, supporting laboratory based experiments. The Ca-rich spherical particles had even larger fractions to contain sulfur and nitrate than did the carbonate particles. also showed that more sea salt particles react with nitric acid more than 95% than do the mineral dusts 50% under laboratory conditions. On the other hand, and various minerals under dry conditions, few experiments directly compared the uptake coefficients of various gases on sea salt and minerals. experimented on authentic dust in a laboratory and demonstrated that calcites CaCO 3 can react with gaseous HNO 3 to form Ca NO 3 2 , which can then deliquesce even under conditions as dry as RH < 12%. Ca-rich spherical particles found frequently in the Beijing atmosphere might well be the modified product of carbonate formed in this manner. This is supported by the following observations. i The elemental composition of the Ca-rich spherical particles resembles that of Carbonate, sometimes with minor inclusions of Al and Si. ii Nitrate was indeed detected in the majority 78% of the Ca-rich spherical particles Figure 2 , a significantly larger percentage than those of irregularly shaped silicate 30% and carbonate 53% . iii Though not shown here, the Ca-rich spherical particles appear as flattened domes in a 3D digital microscope image KEYENCE, VHX-200 . This suggests that the particles were originally in the form of spherical droplets that smashed upon impact. iv Finally, the ratio of carbonate to silicate tended to be smaller in Beijing under humid conditions Figure 3a . In contrast, not many Ca-rich spherical particles were spotted under dry conditions, and the fraction of Ca-rich spherical particles relative to carbonate tended to increase with increasing relative humidity at the point of sampling Figure 3b . Hence, more carbonate particles seem to transform into Ca-rich spheres under more humid conditions.Change in abundance of a carbonate relative to silicate, and b Ca-rich spherical particles relative to carbonate, as functions of RH at point of sampling. Plotted in solid circles are the data from previous measurements. More recently,   Figure 3 indicates that most carbonate can be turned into spherical particles, especially under humid conditions. Carbonate is reported to comprise 10–20% of the atmospheric mineral dust in the interior of China and in the free troposphere over Japan. The carbonate percentage can even reach 50% in Beijing. This indicates that a certain amount of water vapor and nitric acid has the potential to turn a significant portion of mineral dust aerosol 10–50% into spherical particles.[21]  Our study adds insight into the different roles of silicate and carbonate particles in the actual atmosphere, which have long been treated as though they made up a single component of mineral dust in which every particle had the same characteristics. As can be inferred from Figure 2 , carbonate may further increase its high reactivity when turned into an aqueous Ca-rich spherical particle, possibly through an increased uptake efficiency and increasing the limits of the reaction from the particle surface to the bulk of the particle. Spherical particles have optical properties completely different from those of other particles; hence, the role of mineral dust aerosol would be better represented if the carbonate fraction is treated accordingly in the climate and chemistry models."
210,dust aerosol,"A field-scale analysis of the dependence of wind erosion threshold velocity on air humidity. The wind-forced detachment and movement of soil particles, is known for having important regional and global implications on climate change and biogeochemical cycles. The wind erosion process occurs when wind speed exceeds a certain threshold value, which depends on a number of factors, including surface soil moisture. In arid regions changes in atmospheric humidity contribute to most of the variability in surface soil moisture, which, in turn, has a significant influence on wind erosion threshold. This paper investigates the dependence of wind erosion threshold on air humidity in two arid regions in North America, the Mojave Desert CA and Canyonlands UT . Field data are used to test existing models relating the threshold velocity for wind erosion to atmospheric conditions. The threshold velocity is found to be significantly dependent on the atmospheric relative humidity RH and to exhibit a well-defined maximum for RH approximate to 35%. This result validates at the field scale recent theories and laboratory-scale experimental results. , with important effects on the global biogeochemical cycles. Dust emissions resulting from wind erosion are the largest source of tropospheric aerosols, and have an important effect on climate. Relatively high dust concentrations degrade the air quality thereby causing and aggravating respiratory diseases. Moreover, while at the field scale wind erosion causes mechanical injury to growing plants, at the landscape scale aeolian processes redistribute soil particles and nutrients in arid environments with a consequent impact on the composition and structure of vegetation. Thus, understanding factors affecting dust emissions is motivated by the increasing need to estimate long-term changes in soil productivity, assess the economic cost of soil erosion and desertification, estimate the rate of dust suspension into the atmosphere and its contribution to tropospheric aerosols, and predict the effect of climate change scenarios on soil erosion.. Gregory and Darwish . investigated through a series of wind tunnel experiments, the dependence of the threshold velocity on air humidity in the case of air-dry soils. It was found that the threshold shear velocity decreases with increasing values of air humidity for values of relative humidity, RH, between 35% and 60%, while both above and below this range it increases. This result was explained by the effect of hygroscopic forces and their dependence on soil matric potential in the case of air-dry soils. To date no attempts have been made to validate these findings at the field scale.. By analyzing these records, it is possible to understand how variations in meteorological parameters can influence the frequency and intensity of dust emissions in arid regions. This paper uses field data from the American Southwest 1 to assess at the field scale the significance of the hydroclimatic controls on wind erosion threshold, and 2 to validate at the field scale the results of our previous laboratory tests and theoretical studies. Incomplete readings and zero velocity values were discarded from the data set. Days with precipitation were excluded from this analysis, as rain splashing is likely to affect the impact counts by the SENSIT. Moreover, hours with very high humidity values RH > 70% were also discarded, as they make a small sample, especially after the removal of rainy periods. The resulting data set was used to study the dependence between wind speed and air humidity in hours when high SENSIT activity indicated the occurrence of wind erosion.. A significant dependence of surface soil moisture on air humidity was clearly observed in all the four field sites as shown in Figure 1 , suggesting that, even though RH is measured at a 3-meter-height, it can still explain most of the average variability of soil moisture. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that other processes involved in the boundary layer dynamics may affect the relation between RH and surface soil moisture.Dependence of gravimetric surface soil moisture s on air humidity for the four field stations. The soil moisture values s were binned in classes of relative humidity RH . in a set of wind tunnel tests.Effect of relative humidity RH on wind erosion threshold v for the four field stations when saltation is present in the field . The wind velocities v were binned in classes of relative humidity RH .Relative humidity RH as a function of wind speed v for the four stations all data . The wind velocities v were binned in classes of relative humidity RH .. Capillary forces are significant under relatively high soil moisture conditions, when liquid bridges exist between the soil grains. In these conditions the interparticle forces are contributed mostly by capillarity, especially in sandy soils, where only a small water fraction is retained in the adsorbed layer. Conversely, in air-dry soils the adsorptive i.e., hygroscopic components dominate the wet-bonding forces because the soils are too dry for liquid bridge bonding i.e., capillarity to exist and hence the effect of capillarity is negligible. The amount of water adsorbed on the grain surface depends on hygroscopic properties of the soil particles and it increases with the soil clay content. Harnby . For values of RH below this point the threshold velocity increases with an increase in air humidity. For values of RH above this point the threshold velocity decreases with increasing values of RH. as F i = β c d + ∣ψ m ∣ A c , where β c is a dimensional parameter with units Nm −1 , d is the particle diameter, ψ m is the matric potential and A c is the wet contact area between adjacent grains. The term β c d accounts for van der Waals and electrostatic forces, while ∣ψ m ∣ A c accounts for wet-bonding forces associated with the adsorbed or “hygroscopic” water. A small decrease in soil moisture is associated with a strong, non-linear increase in the absolute value of matric potential, with only a relatively small and linear decrease in the contact area A c , leading to a net increase in the wet bonding force ∣ψ m ∣ A c . As a result, the threshold velocity increases with a decrease in surface soil moisture and atmospheric humidity. This type of dependence could be predicted by the Gregory and Darwish 's  As noticed before, these results apply only to “air-dry soils”, i.e., to soils where the effect of capillarity is negligible and most of the interparticle bonding force is contributed by adsorbed-layer bonding. As the atmospheric humidity increases, the thickness of the adsorption film also increases and at some point a stage is reached when condensation starts to occur in the contact points between the particles, thereby forming liquid bridges. The transition between conditions in which water is held only in the adsorbed layer and those in which liquid bridges are formed, is reported to occur for matric potentials of the order of about −30 to −100 MPa, which are characteristic of air-dry soils. In terms of relative humidity, this corresponds to r ≈ 50 to 65%, at equilibrium conditions between soil moisture and near-surface atmospheric humidity. Above these values of RH capillarity forces are expected to control the interparticle bonding. These forces are inversely proportional to ∣ψ m ∣ and increase with increasing soil moisture. Thus the threshold velocity is expected to increase with increasing values of RH for RH > 65%, though we were unable to test this behavior, due to the lack in the available records of a sufficiently-large sample of data points in this humidity range.. The increase in threshold velocity with RH < 35–40% is due to the strengthening of adsorbed-layer bonding caused by the formation of areas of overlap between water films adsorbed onto adjacent the soil grains. The weakening of these interparticle forces for larger values of RH is due to the dependence of wet-bonding forces on soil matric potential in air-dry soils."
211,aerosol,"Retrieving the effective radius of Saharan dust coarse mode from AIRS. We show that the effective radius of the dust coarse mode can be retrieved from Aqua/AIRS observations, using a two step process. First, for each AIRS observation, the dust infrared optical depth, the mean altitude of the dust layer and an estimate of the temperature and water vapor profiles are obtained from 8 spectral channels, using a Look-Up-Table approach. Second, the effective radius is obtained from an additional AIRS channel located at 9.32 mu m , selected for its sensitivity to dust particle size and its insensitivity to dust particle shape or to other potential contaminants ozone, for example . The dust coarse mode effective radius is retrieved from AIRS over the Atlantic Ocean for the period April to June 2003. It compares well with in situ measurements, transport model simulations and sun-photometer retrievals. We find that the coarse mode effective radius decreases slightly with transport distance, from 2.4 mu m to about 2 mu m. ., which explains why a large number of in situ or spatial remote sensing experiments have been performed to retrieve information on dust size distribution. For instance, bimodal size distributions can be retrieved from the Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET ground-based sun-photometers observations. Because of the significant spatial and temporal variability of dust events, a satellite approach is necessary to obtain global size measurements for use in climatological models. On board the Terra and Aqua platforms, the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS is able to retrieve the aerosol effective radius over the oceans. However, . Consequently, dust size, together with dust mineralogical composition, remains a major source of uncertainty in radiative forcing calculations., and archived at Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique since April 2003. In the following, infrared, or thermal infrared, will refer to the wavelength range 3.75 μm 2670 cm −1 to 15.4 μm 650 cm −1 . The 10 μm wavelength, which roughly corresponds to the maximum of the infrared emission from the Earth, is chosen herein as the reference wavelength for infrared optical depth... However, to compute dust extinction at the reference 10 μm wavelength, we can consider the PSD as a monomodal lognormal distribution, since simulations with a Mie code not shown demonstrate that the contribution of the accumulation mode to the total optical depth is below 10%. Indeed, infrared radiation mostly interacts with coarse mode particles. Besides, Mie calculations also show that the width of the distribution has a negligible impact on aerosol optical properties in the thermal infrared. This allows reducing the number of parameters of the PSD to only one: the coarse mode effective radius, which is the most significant size parameter in term of radiative impact. For instance, the impact of the geometric standard deviation of the PSD in the range 1.6 to 2.5 on the normalized extinction coefficient between 3.8 and 15 μm is below 10%. The geometric standard deviation of the distribution has been fixed at 2.2, in agreement with in situ measurements reported by also see http://ara.lmd.polytechnique.fr and the Discrete Ordinate algorithm, at a spectral resolution of 0.02 cm −1 . For convenience, the radiances simulated by the radiative transfer code are converted into their equivalent brightness temperatures BTs . For a tropical situation, with an homogeneous dust layer located between 2000 m and 2700 m, and an aerosol optical depth of 0.6 at 10 μm, Figure 1 shows the difference between BTs calculated with a dust layer composed of a PSD with an effective radius of 3 μm and a PSD with an effective radius of 1 μm. We see that the impact of a change in the effective radius on BTs strongly depends on the wavelength considered. The effect of particle size at infrared wavelengths is of the order of a few tenths of K, which is about 10 times smaller than the decrease in BTs caused by the presence of dust.Sensitivity to particle size distribution at infrared wavelengths. ΔBT: Difference K between the brightness temperature calculated for a dust layer made of particles with an effective radius of 3 μm and the brightness temperature calculated for a dust layer made of particles with an effective radius of 1 μm. Because the sensitivity of channel-165 BT decreases with decreasing dust optical depth or altitude, only AIRS observations where AOD is greater than 0.2 and the mean altitude of the dust layer is greater than 1300 m are considered. As high resolution infrared emissivities may vary substantially with frequency over land surfaces, the retrieval is presently limited to areas over the oceans. Moreover, only night-time observations are considered, in order to avoid solar contamination of near-infrared channels used in the first step of the retrieval. Saharan dust effective radius coarse mode only has been retrieved for the three months of April, May and June 2003 over the Atlantic Ocean, at a spatial resolution of 3.75° in longitude by 2.5° in latitude, which is the spatial resolution of the LMDz-INCA model Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique general circulation model – Interaction with Chemistry and Aerosols . Because of the specific conditions required for generating one retrieval no water cloud, presence of dust, AOD greater than 0.2 , one monthly box may actually contain retrievals for only a few days of observations, especially westward of 45°W, because the AOD decreases from East to West. This is why the results presented have been averaged over the whole time period April to June 2003 , using a 3 by 3 box running mean moving one box by one box . There may be a natural day-by-day variation caused by differences between dust event characteristics e.g., sources , which is reduced by the spatial running mean. Finally, the total number of individual retrievals by box is plotted in Figure 4 top . top Total number of individual retrievals from AIRS after the spatial running mean. middle Mean dust effective radius of the coarse mode for April–June 2003 μm , retrieved from AIRS data. bottom Dust mass median diameter for April–June 2003 μm , simulated with LMDz-INCA. reported in situ measurements of dust mass median diameter from several field campaigns in the range 3 to 9 μm, corresponding to effective radius in the range 1.2 to 3.6 μm. The AERONET sun-photometer at Capo Verde also provides the effective radius of the coarse mode available at http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/ . Table 1 shows the corresponding monthly means for April to June 2003, for two mineral aerosol models, one spherical and one non-spherical. AIRS values are slightly larger but of the same order. However, AERONET “monthly” means, like AIRS monthly means, are calculated only over a few days, when dust amount is large enough and no cloud is present. Owing to the AERONET retrievals being day-time and the AIRS retrievals being night-time, the scenes observed by AERONET and AIRS are obviously not the same, and the days may also differ, which, at least partly, explains the above difference. Indeed, if we consider a climatology from the same AERONET site, the effective radius of the coarse mode is 2.15 ± 0.10 μm, in very good agreement with AIRS retrievals.. As an example, we show in Figure 4 bottom the dust mass median diameter from the LMDz-INCA model for the same period. Only days when the integrated dust load is above a threshold 0.27 g.m −2 , equivalent to a 10-μm AOD of 0.2 are kept in the time average, in order to be consistent with the satellite approach. It is impossible to compare quantitatively the two maps since dust is modelled in LMDz-INCA as a monomodal size distribution rather than the sum of an accumulation and a coarse mode. This is a limitation of the monomodal representation of dust PSD in LMDz-INCA. However, there is a rather good agreement in the size pattern, with larger values close to the African coast and an East-West gradient of dust particle sizes. If the AOD is biased by 0.1, the effective radius is slightly biased too by 0.11 μm but these conclusions still hold. Note also that both the AIRS retrievals and the LMDz-INCA simulations show larger sizes at the latitude of 30°N. The AIRS effective radius decreases more abruptly than the LMDz-INCA mass median diameter, as the mass median diameter also takes into account particles in the accumulation mode, less affected by settling during transport than coarse particles.[16]  A new method to constrain dust size distribution over oceans using high spectral resolution infrared AIRS observations has been developed. It is the first time, to our knowledge, that aerosol effective radius is retrieved from infrared radiances. At visible wavelengths, both the accumulation mode and the coarse mode contribute to the optical depth. Using visible radiances to constrain dust size requires the retrieval of at least three variables the effective radius of each mode and the concentration ratio between the two modes , which is not yet possible. In contrast, the main advantage of using infrared radiances is the fact that infrared radiation is only sensitive to coarse mode particles, the effect of the accumulation mode and of the width of the distribution being negligible. Therefore, the parameter retrieved is the effective radius of the dust coarse mode. This variable is of particular interest in evaluations of the dust radiative forcing.[17]  For the period April to June 2003, the retrieved effective radius of the Saharan dust coarse mode is in good agreement with in situ measurements. The comparison with AERONET products at Capo Verde is good, even though the AIRS-retrieved effective radii are slightly larger. Because of gravitational settling, the retrieved effective radius is reduced with transport distance from 2.4 μm along the African coast to about 2.0 μm over the Caribbean islands . This pattern is consistent with the process of aerosol removal as modelled in LMDz-INCA.[18]  The extension of this study to observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer IASI , scheduled to be launched onboard Metop by the end of 2005, should be very promising. Access to a higher spectral sampling would make possible not only the use of the present method and the retrieval of the dust effective radius, but also the retrieval of additional information on dust microphysics e.g., shape and mineralogical composition by analyzing carefully the information content of each channel."
212,impact aerosol,"Biomass burning as a source of dissolved iron to the open ocean?. While the Mediterranean region is typified by frequent summer fires, the 2003 heat wave that hit Europe, and France in particular, made this season longer causing devastating fires. Aerosol sampling performed in the French Riviera between August and September 2003 indicated that iron concentrations in 2003 were significantly higher than in previous years. Continuous pyrogenic emissions are suspected to be the cause of high Fe concentrations. When these particles were dissolved in seawater, 2% of the total iron content was found in solution. This amount could be significant for the water column on a regional scale. Indeed, these fires might explain the observed dissolved iron enrichment of the surface mixed layer +0.4 nM measured in the Ligurian Sea during August. In contrast to a locally significant effect, pyrogenic inputs have little impact on the global Fe budget since they represent at most 10% of desert dust inputs.  conducted incubation experiments in August 2003 to assess if, under such conditions, low iron concentrations in the surface mixed layer may limit primary production, or at least control phytoplankton species composition. The seawater needed for these microcosm experiments was collected at the beginning of August 2003. Surprisingly, although almost no Saharan input has been recorded since the beginning of stratification, water in the surface mixed layer was found to be significantly enriched in dissolved iron relative to underlying waters. .Location of atmosphere and seawater sampling sites.. Two acid-cleaned polycarbonate filter holders were placed upside down to avoid the impact of rain drops at 3 meters above the ground. Air was filtered through a Nuclepore ® polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 0.4 μm. The flow rate was 1.3 m 3 .h −1 during collection, and the air volumes filtered were on average 16 m 3 . At the end of sampling, filters were stored inside clean petri slides. In addition, a particle counter was placed close to the filter-holders in order to identify the grain size distribution of aerosols collected on the filters., the flasks were left undisturbed, except for a gentle, twice-a-day shake for 7 days. This was assumed to be representative of the contact time between the atmospheric particles and seawater in such a highly stratified system. On day 7, the seawater was filtered through an acid-cleaned Nuclepore polycarbonate membrane pore size 0.2 μm and acidified to pH 2 with HCl. Total dissolved iron was measured using flow injection analysis with chemiluminescence detection see section 2.1 .. When considering the volume particle size distribution, our data show that over 50% of the particles collected had diameter >1 μm. This is due to the close proximity of the fires and the size increase of the pyrogenic particles by aging. Thus, it seems reasonable to consider that these particles have a deposition velocity on the order of 1 cm.s −1 , in close agreement with the velocity 1–2 cm.s −1 actually measured for forest fire aerosols by , 2000, 2001 and 2002. right Surfaces burnt in the French Mediterranean regions for the studied years.. As we do not know the mass of collected aerosols, the dissolution rates obtained here are represented as a function of the total iron concentration resulting from the introduction of the particles to seawater Figure 3 . Figure 3 also includes results from  Recent discussions of the global iron cycle have typically focused on eolian input as the most significant source. Given our original results, it is reasonable to compare the contributions of desert and pyrogenic iron sources globally Table 1 .Fe content in such particles = 0.4%.Dissolution = 2% this study .Assuming a dissolution of 0.8%.. The Fe content of such particles is not very well constrained, and we considered here the recent quantity of 0.4% of iron in burned ash/char in boreal forest fire. This concentration is in agreement with statistics from and applying a percentage of dissolution of iron of 0.8%, we conclude that the input from pyrolitic source represents less than 10% of the desert source. The pyrogenic fluxes were considered at the global scale, and this percentage thus should be even lower when considering only the inputs to the surface of the ocean. Our results indicate that pyrogenic aerosols have little impact on the global marine iron cycle."
215,dust aerosol,"The role of convective plumes and vortices on the global aerosol budget. Atmospheric aerosols produce both a direct radiative forcing by scattering and absorbing solar and infrared radiation, and an indirect radiative forcing by altering cloud processes. Therefore, it is essential to understand the physical processes that contribute to the global aerosol budget. The International Panel on Climate Change IPCC reports that mineral dust contributes to similar to 1/3 of all primary particle emissions to the atmosphere. The significance of mineral dust aerosol becomes evident when one considers the large surface area of arid and semi-arid regions on most continents. It is evident from observations in the U.S. Southwest that convective plumes and vortices lift large quantities of desert dust. Here, we use a combination of observational data and theory to determine the role of convective plumes and vortices on the global aerosol budget. We show that convective plumes and vortices contribute to about 35% of the global budget of mineral dust. . Data collected during this field campaign shows that the dust flux in coherent organized over their vertical extension convective plumes is ∼0.1 g m −2 s −1 , and can exceed ∼1 g m −2 s −1 in convective vortices. Here we refer to strong coherent convective plumes as “dusty plumes” that are typically ∼100 meters in diameter and can persist for about one hour, the time scale of boundary layer convection. Dust devils are defined as dusty convective vortices with typical diameters ranging from 3 to 15 meters and lifetimes of only a few minutes. Their lifetime is, in general, much smaller than that of boundary layer convection because they need convection, as well as vorticity and dust sources, to remain active. The largest observed dust devils have diameters of more than 100 meters and lifetimes in excess of 30 minutes. Thus, a typical convective plume can pump nearly 3000 kg of dust into the atmosphere during its lifetime, and a typical dust devil can pump 20 kg of dust into the atmosphere in its lifetime. Very large dust devils of ∼100 m diameter can pump nearly 15,000 kg of dust in their lifetime. Figure 1 shows a dusty plume and a large dust devil photographed during our 2002 field campaign in Arizona.Convective plume and vortex. top Large dusty non-rotating convective plume. Plumes are generally 100 m in diameter and persist for nearly an hour. bottom Large dust devil. Typical dust devils are generally 10 m in diameter and persist for a few minutes. Both images were taken by N. Renno during the 2002 field campaign near Eloy, Arizona.. However, these studies have focused mainly on dust lifting by large-scale processes. Here, we show that small-scale processes are an important component of the global budget of mineral dust. that convective plumes and vortices lift large quantities of desert dust. Indeed, it has been previously estimated that in the contiguous U.S. alone, approximately 65% of the total dust flux caused by wind action is due to convective vortices. We study the contribution of convective plumes and vortices to the global atmospheric aerosol budget. were similar to that of dust devils, approximately 1,000 times the background atmospheric value. They also show that a very large dust devil ∼100 meters diameter with a vertical velocity of 10 m s −1 has a dust flux of 1 g m −2 s −1 . A background dust concentration of 100 μg m −3 is typical in areas of active dust devils and dusty plumes in the US Southwest. Using typical vertical velocities in convective plumes and vortices of about 1 m s −1 and 7 m s −1 respectively, we conclude that the average dust flux in dusty convective plumes is about 0.1 g m −2 s −1 and 0.7 g m −2 s −1 in dust devils. This dust devil flux is in approximate agreement with earlier observations. We assume that convection is in quasi-steady state; therefore the surface heat flux is approximately balanced by atmospheric radiative flux over the time scale of a convectively active day. Thus, the fractional area covered by convective updrafts is a mean value for the convectively active diurnal period 10:00 to 18:00 local solar time . The radiative time-scale is calculated using the Newtonian cooling approximation of an atmospheric slab where c p ≈ 1005 J kg −1 K −1 is the heat capacity of dry air, ∈ ≈ 0.4 is the emissivity of the convective boundary layer, σ R = 5.67 × 10 −8 W m −2 K −4 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T c ≈ 300 K is the mass-weighted mean temperature of the convective boundary layer. It follows from equation 3 that the radiative time-scale of the convective boundary layer is τ R ≈ 9 × 10 5 s ∼10 days . found that the eddy correlation heat flux in dusty plumes is F in ≈ 3 ± 2 kW m −2 and F in ≈ 11 ± 5 kW m −2 in dust devils. It follows from equation 2 that the fractional area covered by dusty plumes during the convectively active period of the diurnal cycle is about 5 × 10 −5 and the fractional area covered by dust devils is approximately 3 × 10 −5 . Below, we show that these predictions are consistent with observations. Thus, given the heat flux into dusty convective plumes and vortices, equation 2 can be used to predict the fractional area covered by them. to test the predictions of equation 2 . Using the convention of Snow and McClelland  The theoretical and observational data summarized above for dusty plumes and dust devils is used to estimate their contribution to the global mineral dust budget. It follows from the heat engine model that the intensity of convective plumes and dust devils is a function of the amount of energy available for them to do work, which in turn, is equal to the product of the thermodynamic efficiency with the heat input sensible heat flux , that is F av = η F in . The most important global dust source regions lie between 30 to 40°N and have similar altitudes ∼1000 m . These regions are arid or semi-arid and experience similar surface sensible heat fluxes. Thus, the main factor controlling the relative intensity of convective vortices and plumes is their thermodynamic efficiency. The thermodynamic efficiency depends mainly on the depth of the convective boundary layer Z CBL , because changes in the absolute surface temperature T h are relatively small and the dry adiabatic lapse rate Γ ad is constant at ∼10 K km −1 .. Our analysis shows that the thermodynamic efficiency is also large enough for dust devils and convective plumes to lift dust during approximately three months of the year in other dust source regions, in agreement with observation. The fractional areas covered by dust devils during this period are calculated with equation 2 and summarized in Table 1 using sounding data from Tucson, Arizona. As mentioned previously, the predictions of equation 2 are consistent with observations; therefore, the thermodynamic efficiencies seen in the U.S. Southwest during the active dust season are strong enough to initiate strong convection. Thus, the theory can be used to calculate the fractional area covered by both dust devils and dusty plumes in other dust source regions. Calculations based on atmospheric sounding data and theory for a sample of the most important dust source regions are summarized in Table 2 . Sounding data for these regions ranges from 12:00 to 20:00 local time, therefore representing a mean thermodynamic efficiency for convectively active days. These results suggest that the thermodynamic efficiency and fractional area covered by dusty plumes and vortices in these regions are similar to that in the US Southwest.Convective boundary layer depth for Tucson, 2002 atmospheric sounding data .Surface air temperature for Tucson, 2002 atmospheric sounding data .Thermodynamic efficiency from equation 4 .Fractional area covered by dust devils from equation 2 .Convective boundary layer depth for June atmospheric sounding data .Thermodynamic efficiency from equation 4 .Fractional area from equation 2 .. The ratio of DDD to total days of observation from the census data suggests that about 80% of the days of this three month period have dusty plumes and dust devils 72 days per year . During a typical spring/summer day in arid and semi-arid regions, convection is active from approximately 10:00 to 18:00 local solar time. Thus, dusty plumes and dust devils are likely to occur 8 hours per day during 72 days per year. Globally, dusty plumes and dust devils are likely to occur in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to topographical and geological features, these entire regions cannot be considered dust sources. Observations suggest that approximately 40% of global arid and semi-arid regions are active dust sources areas. Therefore, the global active dust source regions cover an area of about 1.3 × 10 7 ± 2 × 10 6 km 2 . Uncertainties in the global contribution were calculated based on the variation in observed values of all measurable parameters in equations 1 through 4 . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC .. Although the concentration of dust is small enough in these regions that plumes and vortices are not visible, fine particles are lifted and can be easily detected by active instruments such as lidars. Land use change in the last 25 years may have increased the global dust source areas by approximately 20% creating enough loose surface particles that strong plumes and vortices can now lift dust and further contribute to the aerosol budget.. The relevance of mineral dust to climate change is compounded by their large spatial and temporal variability as well as their susceptibility to human activities and land use change. We show that dust devils and dusty plumes contribute to about 35% of the global mineral dust budget. Thus, these small scale dust events are responsible for almost 15% of the global aerosol budget. Therefore, we conclude that convective plumes and vortices play an important role in the global aerosol budget."
216,climate aerosol,"Atmospheric controls on mineral dust emission from the Bodele Depression, Chad: The role of the low level jet. Atmospheric aerosols play an important though uncertain role in the Earth's climate system. The Bodele Depression in Chad stands out as the planet's largest source of dust, yet very little is known about the atmospheric circulation that maintain this source. We investigate what key large-scale features of the circulation over the Bodele account for its primacy as a mineral aerosol source. We show, for the first time, the structure and characteristics of the Bodele Low Level Jet LLJ which has a maximum speed near 18 degrees N, 19 degrees E at 925 hPa. It is strongest in the northern winter, receding with the advance of summer in phase with dustiness in the Bodele. Variability of dust over the Bodele occurs contemporaneously with the ridging of the Libyan High and pulsing of the pressure gradient which drives the northeasterlies in which the LLJ is embedded. . Aerosols are one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in the interpretation and projection of past and future climate change. In many regions, mineral dust is the biggest contribution to atmospheric optical thickness, and evidence exists of increasing dust production in recent decades. highlights the importance of the old deserts, particularly in North Africa and the Middle East, as key mineral aerosol sources. Using TOMS AI data, . According to TOMS AI long term means, by far the most important of the African sources is the Bodélé Depression, in northern Chad an area of some 40 000 km 2 centered on 16°N and 18°E, which, unlike almost all other dust sources, remains a major dust source throughout the year. The primacy of the Bodélé has also emerged in other satellite-derived data, e.g. the Infrared Dust Differencing Index IDDI , Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer MISR and MODIS MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer .Example of dust plume from Bodélé Depression 3 March 2003 as observed from MODIS. , the accompanying absence of vegetation, in combination with very fine material, most likely ensures extreme erodibility. But strong surface winds are also essential to any explanation of the Bodélé's global prominence as a dust source. With the exception of Koren and Kaufman while also increasing on secular time scales, an important contribution to our understanding of aerosols would emerge if such variability could be traced to the associated modulation of the atmospheric circulation as against, for example, purely anthropogenic modification of the land surface. ii daily TOMS AI from the Nimbus-7 satellite on a 1.25 × 1 degree grid. We use data only from the Nimbus-7 TOMS sensor from 1979–92 iii MODIS Level 1B channel 4, 3, 1 images from 2002–2004 from which a subjectively derived climatology of dust plume frequency over the Bodélé was derived. Information on the large-scale atmospheric circulation is obtained from two independent reanalysis datasets: i The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF ERA-40 dataset, providing monthly fields on a 1-degree grid ii National Center for Environmental Prediction NCEP reanalysis dataset, providing daily fields on a 2.5 degree grid.. Much less has been written about the wind structure in the months of the rest of the year, outside the monsoon season, but during which there is considerable dust activity, particularly in the Bodélé.. The long term mean 1979–1992 annual cycle of TOMS AOT from this region shows high values throughout the year but with a semi-annual cycle with a primary peak in March, a secondary peak in October and minimum in August Figure 2 . TOMS AI data Figure 2 1979–1992 shows high levels of dust throughout the year, with a peak in May and a minimum in August. It is known that TOMS AI is sensitive to the height of the dust layer, underestimating dust at heights less than 1.5 km. Large scale subsidence is likely to ensure that dust transport occurs in the lowest layers during winter whereas deep, dry convection during summer may lift dust to at least mid-tropospheric heights. This is a likely explanation for the phase shift in the annual cycle of the TOMS AI data towards the summer months, compared with the TOMS AOT, as this is when the boundary layer beings to deepen considerably. The TOMS AOT data is in broad agreement with dust plume climatology over the Bodélé which shows nearly twice as many dust plumes in January to March as in other months of the year Figure 2 . Accordingly, in this paper we use the months of January to April as indicative of enhanced dustiness.Monthly mean values for satellite derived estimates of dust over the Bodélé Depression, TOMS AOT hatched 1979–1992 , monthly mean frequency of large dust plumes over the Bodélé 2002–2004 black , TOMS AI ×10 , 1979–1992 white using right hand vertical axis. The previous section shows the co-location of a LLJ feature with a maximum in dust loadings over the Bodélé. That the LLJ is closely associated with dust production can be strengthened by evaluating the characteristics of the LLJ in months of extreme dust production from the Bodélé. If the location of the LLJ over the Bodélé was simply coincidental, then we would not expect the LLJ to increase decrease during high low dust months. Next, we show that the LLJ is modulated, in phase with dust variability, on intra-seasonal timescales, the causes of which we trace to the evolution of a specific synoptic system. To do this, we regress daily gridded January to April NCEP 925 hPa geopotential height and winds onto a bandpass filtered time series of daily January to April TOMS AI values for the Bodélé TOMS AOT are not available on daily timescales . We have used daily NCEP fields because we do not have access to daily ERA-40 data. First, the seasonal cycle was removed from the daily Bodélé TOMS AI timeseries by subtracting the 30-day running mean of the long term daily mean TOMS AI values over Bodélé. Second, this timeseries of daily TOMS AI anomalies was bandpass filtered to retain variability in the broad 10–35 day band, a procedure common to analysis of intra-seasonal variability. This filter bandwidth is justified by spectral peaks in the Bodélé TOMS AI anomaly timeseries near 12, 20 and 25 days based on three spectral techniques Lomb periodogram, Blackman-Tukey and multi-taper of independent 120 day series for January to April throughout the available TOMS AI record variability at timescales <10 days cannot be quantified due to aliasing of artefacts in the TOMS AI record associated with satellite orbital characteristics . The bandpass filtered daily Bodélé AI timeseries for January to April 1979–92 is then regressed against the daily NCEP fields at each grid box within a broad North African domain for the same period. Using the resulting regression equations at each grid box, the linear dependence of the NCEP variable on bandpassed Bodélé AI can be derived, based on an arbitrary deviation of Bodélé AI in this case +2 standard deviations . The local significance 0.05 level of the regression slope is assessed. Regressions are derived at lags of −15 to +15 days and are used to map the evolution of the circulation over time following Kiladis and Weickmann  The Bodélé Depression is known to be an important source of mineral aerosols. Its prominence in the Sahara must arise because of both the erodibility of the surface material and the erosivity of the wind. In this paper we have drawn attention to the Bodélé Low Level Jet, a feature which is most active in the dusty months of the year. In the ERA-40 data, the jet has a core at 925 hPa near 18°N, 20°E and is present in all months of the year except August although it is strongest in January and weakest in July. Typical reanalysis speeds in the jet core are −8 m.s −1 . Koren and Kaufman hinge on the atmospheric circulation or whether they arise mainly from anthropogenic changes to factors such as surface erodibility."
214,clouds aerosol,"Identifying the regional thermal-IR radiative signature of mineral dust with MODIS. We use MODIS Terra Level 1B data containing calibrated and geolocated radiances to investigate a regional signature of wind-blown mineral dust in the thermal-IR. MODIS data over oceans for the 2000 - 2004 time period were examined for the presence of dust plumes that originate from the main dust sources located in East and South Asia, Middle East, Northern Africa, and Australia. A number of representative cases for different source regions were selected and analyzed in terms of brightness temperatures at three IR channels centered at 8.55, 11.03, and 12.02 mu m. The distinct differences in the thermal-IR signature of atmospheric dust for the considered regions were found. Our analysis indicates that these differences are likely due to different mineralogical composition, although other factors e. g., multilayered vertical distribution may be also involved. Implications of our findings to the detection of dust based on the techniques using brightness temperature differences are discussed. . Detection is based on brightness temperature differences BTD either in two or three channels. The former is called the bispectral split-window technique and the latter is the trispectral approach. Although the split-window techniques that use observations near the 11 and 12 μm bands have been primarily applied to volcanic aerosols, they have also been used for the detection of dust. For instance, Dunion and Velden demonstrated that analyzing brightness temperature differences between the 8 and 11 μm channels against BTD between the 11 and 12 μm channels enables to discriminate dust from the clear sky over both oceans and lands. The Ackerman study implied that a universal threshold in the BTD values could be used to detect dust over the diverse geographical regions. However, mounting evidence suggests that the properties of dust strongly vary between dust sources. In particular, the mineralogical composition, which is a key factor controlling the IR radiative properties of dust, exhibits strong regional differences. Considering several representative mineral mixtures, a modeling study by Sokolik . Therefore, our approach was based on manual scene classification using true color MODIS images. Out of about 180,000 images accumulated over the entire globe for the period from 24 February, 2000, to 30 April, 2004, about 600 images showed dust over oceans. Each image represents a true color composite of a single Level 1B daytime 5-min granule of MODIS data. Figure 1 schematically shows seven geographical regions selected in this study. For each region, a number of representative cases were chosen for which we obtained the Level 1B data containing calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances in 36 spectral bands at the 1 × 1 km resolution. Our final selection for this study consisted of 49 images with a unambiguous presence of dust. For each true color image, the pixels were manually classified as “clear”, “partly cloudy”, “cloudy”, “mixed dust and cloud”, “dust” and “heavy dust”.Schematic representation of the geographical regions analyzed in this study.. A number of studies have pointed out that several distinct sources can contribute to westward transport our region 1 . To address this issue, we sorted dust outbreaks with similar westward transport into three latitudinal groups based on their location off the west coast of North Africa: 8°–16°N, 16°–24°N, and 24°–28°N. Dust plumes in the first group are most likely to originate from Algeria and Bodele Depression, while dust outbreaks in 16°–24°N and 24°–28°N latitudinal bands are from Algeria and Mauritania, respectively. Selecting cases with similar transport routes of dust outbreaks also helps to minimize differences introduced by varying atmospheric conditions. Also, several regions were selected for Asian sources. Regions 4 and 5 represent dust outbreaks originating from the Iranian and Thar deserts, whereas the region 6 represents dust plumes that likely originated from the Gobi and Taklamakan regions. Region 7 represents dust from the Australian deserts. We were able to identify only three cases for this source, and all of them were associated with eastward transport. We were not able to identify the dust outbreaks originating from the American sources, such as Patagonia and Baja. It is likely that dust plumes from those deserts are not often transported over the ocean and/or too weak for detection by satellite imagery. and explained by spectral differences in water vapor absorption. Because these MODIS channels lie in the thermal-IR window, absorption by other atmospheric gases is negligibly small. Over the Mediterranean Sea region 2 , BT 11 – BT 12 are negative in the presence of dust, while for clear sky and cloudy areas BT 11 – BT 12 are positive. Similarly, negative BT 11 – BT 12 are caused by Asian dust over the Yellow Sea region 6 . However, negative BT 11 – BT 12 are also caused by some clouds in region 6. Over the Mediterranean Sea, BT 8 – BT 11 for dust are negative and smaller than those for clouds but larger than BT 8 – BT 11 for clear skies. In contrast, over the Yellow Sea, BT 8 – BT 11 are positive for dust and for some cloudy areas.Example of two dust outbreaks in regions 2 top and 6 bottom . Shown are the true color image, BT 8 – BT 11 and BT 11 – BT 12 differences in K .  Figure 4 summarizes the mean BTD and standard deviations calculated for “heavy dust” cases along with clear sky cases. The dust BTD values show specific features depending on the particular region. Some of the regions appear to group on the trispectral diagram. Regions 1 16°–24°N , 1 24°–28°N , 3, and 4 form one group with BT 11 – BT 12 and BT 8 – BT 11 values of about −0.1 K and −1.7 K, respectively. Regions 7 and 5 form another group with the BT 11 – BT 12 difference of −1.0 K and BT 8 – BT 11 of −1.1 K. Regions 1 8°–16°N , 2, and 6 differ from the others, showing several distinct features such as positive BT 11 – BT 12 in regions 1 8°–16°N and 2, and positive BT 8 – BT 11 in region 6. The question arises: Can we isolate the factors that control the infrared signature of atmospheric dust? Differences in the satellite viewing geometry may play a role. However, in our analysis the pixels with dust were observed at random locations within the granules, thus for a large enough number of granules the geometry effect would increase the data scatter but will not change the mean. This was confirmed by analyzing plots similar to the ones shown in Figure 3 , but for different cosine of the viewing angle ranging from about 0.6 to 1 in a discrete interval of 0.1. As expected, a shift in data points was observed with changes of the viewing angle, however various regional differences between the BTD points remained. Furthermore, previous studies showed that the BTD are relatively insensitive to changes in the size distribution compared to changes in the mineralogical composition. Therefore we conclude that the different regional mineralogical composition of dust, which controls its radiative properties in the IR spectrum, is likely the main reason for observed differences in the regional dust signature as was suggested by previous modeling studies. It seems that, by accounting for the angular geometry, one can constrain the regional dust composition based on the results shown in Figure 4 . Unfortunately, an additional complexity arises from the fact that dust exhibits a complex multi-layered vertical distribution during mid- and long-range transport in the atmosphere. Dust properties can be dissimilar from layer to layer and thus can hamper the interpretation of regional BTD in terms of differences in the dust mineralogical composition. Collocated MODIS and new space lidar CALIPSO observations will provide valuable data to further explore the nature of the dust regional radiative signature.Combined trispectral diagram of brightness temperature differences for “heavy dust” pixels for all considered regions.[9]  In this study we utilized the MODIS data in the thermal-IR to investigate the radiative signature of atmospheric dust on a regional basis and implications to dust detection. Forty-nine scenes with the clear presence of dust plumes were analyzed for seven different regions over the oceans during the 2000–2004 time period.[10]  Our analysis demonstrated that automated discrimination between cloudy and dusty pixels based on the split-window or the trispectral approach with a fixed BTD threshold is not reliable. For some of the regions it is still possible to use BT 11 – BT 12 difference as a simple, regionally dependent single value threshold test. An interesting finding that confirms the presence of the regional radiative signature of dust is that clear sky pixels tend to group in a tight cluster on the trispectral diagram while the dusty data show significant scatter. In the presence of dust, BTD values for some of the regions tend to group, while others have some distinct features. For instance, regardless of the viewing angle, regions 1 8°–16°N and 2 tend to have positive BT 11 – BT 12 , whereas region 6 has positive BT 8 – BT 11 .[11]  Based on our analysis, we conclude that the regional radiative signature of dust observed in the MODIS data is likely due to the different mineralogical composition controlled by the diverse dust sources, although the multilayered vertical distribution may also be important. This is in agreement with previous modeling studies. Thus, one has to consider the origin of atmospheric dust in order to utilize the BT difference techniques in their full potential. In turn, the regional IR signature may be helpful in identifying the origin of dust plumes from remote sensing observations. A combination of passive IR remote sensing and the space lidar CALIPSO has a high potential to provide an additional constraint on dust regional properties."
218,particles dust ocean,"Features in wavelength dependence of aerosol absorption observed over central India. Measurements on spectral dependence of aerosol light absorption and BC mass concentrations were made at various locations between Ahmedabad 23.03 degrees N, 72.50 degrees E and Hyderabad 17.47 degrees N, 78.45 degrees E during February 2004. Average concentration of BC was close to 2 mu g/m 3 which is about 2 to 5% of the total aerosol mass loading measured at the surface. Absorption Angstrom coefficient estimated using a relation of the form beta abs lambda =K.lambda -alpha is found to vary between 1.2 to 2.0 at different locations. Our result shows an excess absorption of up to 30% in lower wavelengths below 880 nm. Deviation from lambda -1 dependence, which is typical of BC from fossil fuel, shows that aerosol mixture contains other particles from biofuel/biomass or mineral dust. As there was no major biomass burning observed in the study region as well as no specific enhancement observed in the coarse size aerosols, we attribute the observed excess absorption to the biofuel combustion. , thereby complicating the radiative forcing estimation. One of the crucial climate forcing agents is black carbon BC aerosols, mostly produced as a result of incomplete combustion of coal, diesel, petrol, biofuels and biomass burning. Magnitude of net aerosol radiative forcing not only depends on absolute mass concentration of individual components like BC but also on its mass fraction in total aerosol loading. The other important factor which needs to be taken into consideration in radiative forcing calculations is the spectral dependence of light absorption by aerosols., measurements of aerosol characteristics over land areas have been very limited and also confined to specific locations. In this study we present the results on spectral dependence of aerosol light absorption and BC mass concentrations measured at different locations see Figure 1 in two phases as part of a land-campaign conducted over the central India between Ahmedabad 23.03°N, 72.50°E and Hyderabad 17.47°N, 78.45°E from 7 to 29 February 2004. Observations were conducted at selected stations which are rural locations, away at a distance of more than ∼3 km from any major industry or highway and mostly between 11 am and 5 pm local time . Results presented here are significant as we observed different features on wavelength dependence of light absorption by aerosols at different locations, emphasizing on the importance of measurement of light absorption by aerosols particularly over the Indian region where major source of BC is biomass/biofuel and not fossil fuel and the same BC can exhibit stronger absorption characteristics.Stations where observations were made during the land campaign in February 2004 between Ahmedabad and Hyderabad. Locations marked as square are the stations used during the onward journey and the triangles are the stations used during return journey. that acts as a perfect diffuse scattering matrix with light absorbing particles embedded in it. The difference in light transmission through the particle-laden sample spot and a particle free reference spot of the filter is attributed to the absorption caused by the aerosol. The attenuation data are converted into BC mass loading using a set of wavelength dependent calibration factors. The instrument was operated at a flow rate of 3   Figure 2 shows the average value of BC mass concentration for all observations made between 10 am to 5 pm of local time, obtained at different stations of the campaign from 880 nm channel of the Aethalometer. Since observations were repeated at most of the stations, BC values measured during onward and return journey are shown using different colors. We found the, the spectral dependence of light absorption by aerosols is mostly determined by the size of graphite clusters present within the absorbing material.  Assuming BC to be the only absorbing aerosol component present, we estimated the absorption coefficient at all the seven wavelength channels using equation 3 with α value equal to unity and forcing the power law curve to cross the absorption coefficient value measured at 880 nm channel. Our result on spectral dependence of light absorption shows an excess absorption of up to 30% in the wavelength range of 0.4 to 1.0 μm Figure 4 . While λ −1 dependence for aerosol absorption is typical of BC emitted from fossil fuel, deviation from λ −1 indicates contribution of absorbing particles from biofuel/biomass burning or mineral dust. As there was no major biomass burning activity observed in the study region and also no specific enhancement in the amount of coarse mode particles measured using QCM device, we attribute the observed excess absorption to BC particles coming from biofuel burning used for cooking in rural India. Figure 4 shows the BC mass fraction for all stations estimated by taking the ratio of BC mass from Aethalometer and the total aerosol mass from a QCM device, which varied between 2 to 5% over the study region.BC mass fraction in the total aerosol concentration and the excess absorption by aerosols in the wavelength range of 370 to 950 nm.[9]  Distinctly different features in wavelength dependence of light absorption by aerosols with absorption Angstrom coefficient α varying between 1.2 to 2.0 was observed over the central Indian region indicating differences in their composition and hence their origin. In a recent work by [2005] it is shown that in India about 44% of the total BC emission comes from biofuel combustion. Our result on spectral dependence of light absorption shows an excess absorption of up to 30% in the shorter wavelength range, less than 880 nm. This emphasizes the fact that measurement of spectral dependence of light absorption by aerosols is more important than mere knowledge about the mass concentration of BC as aerosol absorption can exhibit different wavelength characteristics at locations where major source of BC is not fossil fuel. While λ −1 dependence for aerosol absorption is typical of BC emitted from fossil fuel, deviation from λ −1 indicates contribution of absorbing particles from biofuel/biomass burning or mineral dust. As we have not observed any major biomass burning activity in the study region and also no specific enhancement in the amount of coarse particles is observed, we attribute the observed excess absorption to particles coming from biofuel burning used for cooking in rural India."
219,dust atmosphere,"A method to infer short wave absorption due to aerosols using satellite remote sensing. Retrieval of aerosol absorption using satellite remote sensing is an important but difficult problem. Earlier studies have demonstrated that the effect of aerosol absorption is small over surfaces with low reflectance, but is important over surfaces with large surface reflectance. Here, we propose a method to infer the short wave absorption characteristics of aerosols using satellite remote sensing. The proposed method exploits high surface reflectance of continents especially deserts and absorbing nature of aerosols. The advent of multi-spectral satellites such as MODIS provides an excellent opportunity to infer the regional distribution of aerosol absorption. The method is validated using ground-based measurements. The overall error in the inferred single scattering albedo is +/- 0.02 and +/- 0.03 corresponding to surface reflectance of 0.15 and 0.25 respectively. . Most of the aerosol sources dust outbreaks, forest fires industrial emissions and so on , however, are confined to continental locations. The radiative forcing due to aerosols depends on its absorption and scattering properties. A moderate change in the single scattering albedo for example, from 0.95 to 0.85 can change its radiative forcing from negative to positive. The relative importance of scattering and absorption in satellite remote sensing has been addressed by various investigators since 1980s. These studies have demonstrated that the effect of absorption is small over surfaces with low reflectance, but is important over surfaces having high surface reflectance. Retrieval of aerosol absorption using satellite remote sensing is a difficult problem. . Here, they used a two-step method. First, surface spectral reflectance was derived from the radiance measured in the ‘clear’ day. Then, this surface reflectance was used to compute the radiance in ‘hazy’ day using measured optical depths. Several values of aerosol refractive indices and effective radii were used iteratively until a fit to the measured radiance was reached.  The results reported earlier show that when absorbing aerosol such as black carbon or dust is present over a moderately/highly reflecting surface such as desert, then TOA albedo becomes lower than surface albedo. The change in albedo or ΔAlbedo is defined here as the difference between TOA albedo and surface albedo.  The ΔAlbedo is a function of surface reflectance ρ S , single scattering albedo ω and aerosol optical depth τ a When ρ S is zero, albedo at the TOA is contributed only by Rayleigh scattering and aerosol scattering. In this case, ΔAlbedo is positive. As ρ S increases, ΔAlbedo becomes negative.. We have used three different single scattering albedos for the purpose of sensitivity analysis. The surface reflectance ρ s used here corresponds to that of deserts 0.25 . OPAC Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds is a comprehensive database on various types of aerosols and contains the optical properties in the solar and terrestrial spectral range of water droplets, aerosols and ice crystals. In OPAC model, aerosol is assumed to be a mixture of different components. The aerosol properties from . In Figure 1a , the three curves correspond to three single scattering albedo values ω = 1.0, 0.9 and 0.85 . The following can be observed from Figure 1a . a Change in albedo ΔAlbedo as a function of aerosol optical depth at 0.5 μm for three different single scattering albedos. b Variation of critical optical depth as a function of single scattering albedo for various surface reflectances. Since the spectral characteristics of the aerosol optical depths depend strongly on the aerosol size distribution, the spectral radiance measured by satellite contains information on size distribution of aerosols. In Figure 2 , we show ΔAlbedo as a function of wavelength. Here, we have used same single scattering albedo in both cases, but used two different size distributions with mode radii 0.07 μm and 0.39 μm respectively . It can be seen that when wavelength increases ΔAlbedo decreases. This is mainly due to the increasing surface reflectance as a function of wavelength. Corresponding to an aerosol size distribution with mode radii r m = 0.07 μm, spectral variation of aerosol optical depth is steeper larger Angstrom wavelength exponent compared to that correspond to r m = 0.39 μm. Figure 2 also shows that the wavelength at which ΔAlbedo = 0 defined here as critical wavelength, λ C is a function of mode radius of the aerosol size distribution. Thus, simultaneously using τ C and λ C , aerosol absorption properties as well as the dominant size of absorption can be inferred.The ΔAlbedo as a function of wavelength. Here, we have used same single scattering albedo in both cases, but used two different size distributions with mode radii R of 0.07 and 0.39, respectively.. AERONET derive single scattering albedo ω from sky radiance measurements. Long term observations at Solar Village shows that aerosol absorption is maximum in November and minimum during July. The plot of ΔAlbedo TOA albedo minus surface albedo as a function of aerosol optical depth measured at Solar Village during November is shown in Figure 3a . The solid line is the least-square fitted line to the data points hollow circles . The single scattering albedo shown in Figure 3 ∼0.89 was obtained from AERONET sky radiance data. Figure 3b shows the same plot for July ω = 0.97 obtained from AERONET data . The critical optical depth in the two cases were ∼0.21 and ∼0.64 respectively. This observation is consistent with our simulations shown in Figure 1a and demonstrates that τ C can be used to infer the aerosol absorption properties. The surface albedo of Solar Village region is close to 0.3. In Figure 4 , we show the variation of critical optical depth as a function of single scattering albedo for a surface reflectance of 0.3 along with the critical reflectance inferred using the method proposed here and those estimated using AERONET sky radiance measurements. a Change in albedo ΔAlbedo as a function of aerosol optical depth at 0.5 μm at Solar Village for November b ΔAlbedo as a function of aerosol optical depth at 0.5 μm at Solar Village for July 2000.Variation of critical optical depth as a function of single scattering albedo for a surface reflectance of 0.3 hollow circles and solid line . The solid squares represent the values inferred from AERONET and MODIS data. We have demonstrated that using spectral albedo at TOA measured by satellites, absorbing properties of aerosols over bright surfaces such as deserts can be inferred. How about soot aerosols over urban locations? Obviously, absorbing properties of soot can be inferred using this method over continental locations. It may be, however, noted that using this method we cannot differentiate absorption from different aerosol species. The absorption inferred using this method is due to composite aerosols. The method, however, is not applicable over oceans due to low reflectance or regions with thick vegetation. When surface reflectance is low, the impact of aerosol absorption to TOA albedo is significantly reduced. In summary, we have proposed an alternate and simple method to infer the aerosol single scattering albedo using satellite remote sensing. This method does not require the assumption of size distribution or effective radius and provides a method to retrieve single scattering albedo more or less analytically.[14]  • A method to infer the short wave absorption characteristics of aerosols using satellite remote sensing is proposed and demonstrated using simultaneous ground-based and satellite measurements.[15]  • The proposed method makes use of high surface reflectance of deserts and absorbing nature of aerosols.[16]  • The advent of multi-spectral sensors such as MODIS provides an excellent opportunity to infer the regional distribution of aerosol absorption characteristics.[17]  • For a typical uncertainty in satellite derived optical depth of 0.1, the uncertainty in inferred single scattering albedo is estimated as ±0.02 and ±0.03 corresponding to surface reflectance of 0.15 and 0.25 respectively."
220,particles dust aerosol,"Measurements of continuous spectra of atmospheric absorption coefficients from UV to NIR via optical method. In this study we extend from the visible to the UV a traditional method for studying the radiative properties of black carbon. We apply this measuring possibility to a practical study carried out in the Southern Iberian Peninsula during summer 2004. Using an optical technique based on the integrating sphere method, absorption coefficients, sigma a , were determined in the visible and in the ultraviolet regions of spectrum. The obtained values are representative of remote areas including during desert episodes that reach this area. To analyse the spectral shape of sigma a we derived a parameter alpha a which is the slope of the linear fit of the log-log plot of sigma a versus lambda. This parameter is similar to the Angstrom exponent used for extinction. The reported alpha a values for the UV appear as very original data in the literature. , at least, when compared with the abundance of scattering data. Besides, most of the existing data is obtained through filter based methods which derive absorption from the change in light transmission through a filter where the particles are collected. These methods include the integrating plate, the integrating sphere, the PSAP Particle Soot Absorption Photometer or the aethalometer. Other methods are the photoacoustic or the calorimetric methods.. Its absorption coefficient is substantially higher than other species at the wavelengths we are working with: ultraviolet and visible. On the other hand, black carbon can be mixed with other species in different states of aggregation, internal mixture, external mixture, or core-shell structure, with significant changes in the optical properties. For example, the absorption coefficient of an internal mixture of elemental carbon with non-absorbent particles is larger than the absorption coefficient of an external mixture. For a more complete understanding of black carbon behavior in the atmosphere it is necessary to gather a large and continuous time set of observations, especially in the ultraviolet region of spectrum, since very few values are found in the literature, except those measured with aethalometers. A reliable determination of the absorption coefficient of aerosols hence the complex refractive index or the single scattering albedo in the UV region is now one of the major challenges in aerosol studies. Here, we show the absorption coefficient determination and also the values associated to the spectral shape by means of a parameter similar to the Ångstrom exponent, α, used for extinction. The filters were weighed before and after collection and care was taken in order to eliminate electrostatic charges from the filters before weighing.. We enhanced the illumination and detection systems of the original method. In spite of being a destructive technique it has the advantage of approaching the aerosol measurement conditions to the natural conditions of the atmospheric aerosols, when compared to the option of using the particles trapped in the filters. Furthermore, the real part of the refractive index of chloroform is nearly the same as that of suspended particles, so the light scattering is highly reduced. The effect of changing the medium from chloroform to air is a reduction in the effective refractive index. As a consequence, light absorption is reduced by a maximum of 5%, therefore no refractive index correction is applied to the results reported in this paper. Aerosol absorption coefficients σ Mean Std Minimum Maximum σ a  In Figure 3 we present the spectral shape variation of absorption coefficients throughout the spectrum. The three curves presented belong to three example days: one exceptionally high Jul 27 , one particularly low Sep 01 and the last with the normal atmospheric condition of the area Aug 13 . As shown in Figure 3 the absorption coefficient decreases with wavelength, the smaller the wavelength the higher the absorption coefficient. This decrease, however, is not very pronounced, reaching a maximum difference between 320 nm and 800 nm of 0.98 Mm −1 and a minimum difference of 0.14 Mm −1 , during our measurement period. The average difference between absorption coefficients at 320 nm and 800 nm was 0.44 Mm −1 . Our daily detection limit is 0.003 Mm −1 and a rough estimate of the measurement error does not exceed 10%. This estimate is higher in the UV and NIR because of the lower source intensities in those regions, resulting in more noisy signal levels. Figure 3.

In the UV values are generally higher but with more extreme values −0.1 to 2.5 .

The reported values of σ a are relatively low, presenting in average 1.22 Mm −1 , 0.93 Mm −1 and 0.78 Mm −1 for UV 320 nm , visible 500 nm and NIR 800 nm respectively. The values in the UV are in average 24–25% higher than in the visible region of spectrum. Measuring σ a with high spectral resolution allowed us to determine reliable α a values. These values are very innovative in the literature giving news about aerosol absorption characterization. As we observed a large range of α a values, it would be interesting to make a more extensive comparison of these values in a near future. All the reported values are sufficiently representative of non-urban sites in Spain where the arrival of desert dust aerosol is relatively frequent.σ a variation along the spectrum for three representative days: a particularly high, Jul 27 ▴ ; a day of low value, Sep 01 × ; and a day of medium level, Aug 13 ⊕ .: σ a = where K is a constant, λ is the wavelength of light, and the subscript a indicates the absorption by particles.

222,particles impact,"Implications of droplet nucleation to mineral dust aerosol deposition and transport. Calculations from a microphysics model are shown which indicate the factors that control droplet nucleation scavenging of hydrophilic mineral dust particles over a large range of conditions including the size, chemical composition, and number density of particles in both cumulus and stratus clouds. We focus specifically on the activation threshold radius ATR for droplet nucleation which determines the particles that are activated and those available for further transport and subsequent iron deposition to the remote ocean. Results suggest: the ATR is typically found in the range of clay-sized particles radius =.1 to 1. &mu; m , a spectrum over which the amount of dust removed declines &SIM; 60% both in surface area and particle number; nucleation of silt-sized particles 1.-10. &mu; m occurs under most conditions; larger fractions of mineral aerosols are removed in cumulus clouds than in stratus; and while acid coating of dust particles in polluted environments acts to decrease the ATR, the effect is reduced by competition with soluble aerosols. Regional mineral dust environments exhibit potentially diverse aerosol wet removal impacts. The ATR representative of the tropical Atlantic ocean basin <. 2 &mu; m indicates &SIM; 80% removal of the total dust surface area, while in the pristine southern hemisphere mid latitudes an ATR &SIM;. 5 &mu; m implies &SIM; 60%. In contrast, varying conditions in the polluted region of East Asia suggest a large ATR spectrum . 2 to 3. &mu; m with dust surface area removal ranging from > 80% to < 10%. . This allows efficient nucleation removal during snowfall or in deep cumulus clouds for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles. However, it is not clear if or when hydrophilic mineral particles can be activated as droplet nuclei and what dust aerosols are hydrophilic. It has been observed that water droplets would nucleate on quartz and samples of surface dust only under high supersaturations not observed in the atmosphere, suggesting that silt-sized particles are hydrophobic and do not nucleate cloud droplets. An earlier study indicated that clay-sized particles may be hydrophilic and removed by cloud nucleation. More recently it was found that aged dust aerosols are often coated by sulfate and nitrate through heterogeneous chemical reactions, and could become cloud condensation nuclei CCN similar to sulfate aerosols. Sulfate coating may also result from cloud processes: cloud drops collect dust particles while new sulfate is produced by gas scavenging and subsequent oxidation of SO 2 in the drops, and then evaporate. This introduces the possibility that dust may originate as hydrophobic particles and then be transformed to hydrophilic depending on the amount of background pollution during transport. In light of these measurement and modeling studies, we investigate the possible size dependent removal of hydrophilic mineral dust by droplet nucleation. For hydrophilic aerosols, below-cloud scavenging is not nearly as important as nucleation removal. We present calculations of droplet nucleation and growth using a microphysics model of an ascending air parcel in cumulus and stratus clouds, considering varying chemical compositions in clean air and polluted environments. The potential ramifications of these results are then qualitatively interpreted in distinct regional areas influenced by transport and deposition of mineral dust.. We calculate the rate of droplet growth by water vapor condensation in clouds using a numerical microphysics model that considers both the size and chemical compositions of the nuclei in an ascending air parcel. The model is described by Liu and Wang . For dust particles, the soluble fraction is assumed to be sulfate surface coating on a sphere.. A relative humidity of 99% is assumed for the calculation of initial droplet sizes just below the cloud base. The equations are integrated numerically over time.. For the weaker vertical velocities of stratus clouds we chose two cases where air parcels ascend either at a constant rate of 0.02 m s −1 typical of common mid latitude synoptic scale low pressure systems or 0.1 m s −1 associated with the strongest cyclones. The minimum size of nucleating particles provides a transition point between dust particles available for continuing transport and those which are removed by precipitation. This may have a significant influence on the global contribution of mineral dust to the atmospheric radiative balance and the iron flux to the oceans. The ATR is determined by the maximum S obtained in the ascending air parcel, and is impacted by the soluble mass fraction of dust particles a measure of aging . For example, Figure 3 shows the threshold sensitivity to the soluble mass fraction of dust particles in a shallow cumulus cloud. The 1:1 line in Figure 3 indicates no nucleation or growth, while activated particles grow into large droplets r > 10 μm , as indicated by symbols located far above the 1:1 line. In this case the threshold radius is .10 μm for a sulfate coating of 1% and increases to .27 μm for a sulfate coating of .01%, indicating more clay-sized particles escape nucleation at lower soluble mass.Snapshot of droplet sizes at 1 km above cloud base in a shallow cumulus cloud grown on nucleating mineral dust particles with soluble masses at 1% crosses, model case C02 in Table 1 and 0.01% squares, model case C01 in Table 1 respectively. Solid line indicates a 1:1 relationship that is, zero growth on non-activated particles .. Also presented are the impact of the ATR on the percent of total surface area removed by droplet nucleation, which influences atmospheric radiation as well as downstream air-to-sea iron flux, and the percent of total particles activated, which influences available ice nuclei. Overall, while the droplet nucleation of silt-sized dust >1. μm occurs under most conditions, the ATR tends to vary over the scale of clay-sized particles .1–1.0 μm . This is a range where the decrease in the amount of total dust removed is most sensitive to increasing ATR, both in terms of surface area ∼95% to ∼35% and particle number 60% to 1% . In addition, larger fractions of mineral dust are removed in shallow cumulus than in the stratus clouds, because a greater supersaturation is reached in the former Figure 1 . Comparing cases S05, S08 , S06, S09 or C05, C08 indicates that the ATR increases with the number of competing sulfate aerosols. But it is insensitive to the concentration of mineral dust aerosols, as shown by cases C04, C10 , C05, C11 and S05, S11 . Also, in polluted environments, enhancing the sulfate coating results in an increase of nucleating particles and a concomitant increase in surface area removal e.g., cases S04–S06, C04–C06 .Here w is the vertical velocity of the air parcel; S max is the maximum supersaturation; the stratus clouds have a base temperature of 280 K at 900 mb; the cumulus clouds have a base temperature of 293 K at 930 mb; and seasalt mass concentration is 9 μg m −3 in all cases. Regions 2 and 3 are clean air domains. The tropical Atlantic basin as represented by cases C01 or C02 is subjected to cumulus droplet nucleation with a threshold radius ranging from .27 μm or .10 μm, indicating that up to 40% of the total mineral dust particles could escape droplet nucleation removal and be available downwind as ice nuclei, while >80% of the total surface area would be removed. In contrast, the higher latitudes of the southern hemisphere case S01 typically experiences stratus removal which allows dust >.5 μm to be activated. Surprisingly, while ∼60% of the dust surface area is removed, ∼97% of the total dust particles escape and can be transported downstream. This would lead to an abundance of clay-sized particles in the southern hemisphere.[13]  In region 1 the Asian dust source is located just upstream of a polluted environment. This yields significantly different transport scenarios dictated by the time in transit over SO 2 and NO sources, and the resulting amount of soluble coating aging . Slow transport increases the soluble coating rapid aging which decreases the threshold radius to .38 μm case S06 , while conversely, rapid transport less coating/slow aging, case S04 greatly increases the ATR to the silt-sized range 3.0 μm . Interestingly, this substantial increase in ATR has little impact on the number of activated particles, but a large effect on the dust surface area removal ∼68% versus ∼8% which could have a profound influence on both local and oceanic iron deposition to the ocean. If there is precipitation during transport over East Asia, heavily coated particles are removed, while uncoated clay and small silt particles avoid droplet nucleation. However, if there is no precipitation all particles are transported downstream to the central and eastern Pacific. In this less polluted environment the ATR is not nearly as sensitive to soluble coating and, consequently, the surface area removal increases to >50% cases S01–S03 enhancing wet deposition.[14]  The microphysics calculations for appropriate environmental conditions strongly suggest that the ATR is typically found within the range where droplet removal of dust, both in terms of number of particles and surface area, is highly variable. However, the global implications of droplet nucleation to mineral dust deposition and transport described here are based on qualitative assumptions. Future measurement campaigns focusing on the size distribution and hygroscopic nature of dust aerosols as well as global model transport simulations are needed to quantify the effect of variable droplet nucleation on the global distribution and deposition of mineral dust."
223,dust,"Influence of aerosol climatology on forecasts of the African Easterly Jet. The European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts ECMWF recently implemented a revised annually varying aerosol climatology in their forecasting system. The new climatology greatly reduces the aerosol optical depth over the Sahara compared to the previous time-invariant climatology. Using high resolution dropsonde data in addition to the model analyses, it is demonstrated that the direct radiative effect resulting from the aerosol climatology modification significantly improves the ECMWF 5-day forecasts of the African Easterly Jet, the central dynamical feature in this region.  but this will not be addressed in this article. show inadequacies in the prediction of the 700 hPa African Easterly Jet AEJ at the 5-day range when compared to the analyses in the former study and to high resolution dropsonde data in the latter. As the forecast progresses, the jet generally weakens substantially, especially to the east, and is usually too zonal in structure. This is despite the fact that the analysis replicates the observed AEJ with reasonable fidelity. The accurate prediction of the jet structure is important, since it is a central component of the African monsoon system in the Sahel region and plays an important role in the initiation of both African Easterly waves and mesoscale convective complexes as well as tropical cyclogenesis.. In response, the ECMWF model has recently incorporated a new aerosol climatology, significantly altering the aerosol optical depth in this region. The consequences for the forecast of the AEJ are presented here. available at http://www.ecmwf.int/publications ... Table 1 compares the maximum optical thicknesses in the old and new climatologies. In particular, the old climatology was dominated by desert aerosols, with a spatial maximum optical thickness of 1.9 over the Saharan region. This annual mean figure is replaced by a spatially moving peak value of between 0.18 December and 1.01 July in the dust-like aerosol category of the new climatology, with the peak again over the Sahara. This reduction is also confirmed by more recent in situ studies. Note that the vertical distributions for all aerosol components are similar in the two climatologies, and that the new climatology has no requirement for a tropospheric background climatology, while the stratospheric aerosol loading remains unchanged. Further details are in the work of , and revised optical thicknesses are from . This averaging, the implicit near-grid diffusion of the model and the lower vertical resolution, all lead to smoother model fields relative to the data. Examination of the model and dropsonde transects Figures 1b–1d reveals that the structure of the jet in the forecast has also slightly improved. In addition to increasing the core velocities in excess of 2 m s −1 , the greatest acceleration >3 m s −1 is at the southern end of the transect, where the errors were greatest. However, neither forecast captures the north-south tilt of the zonal wind, where the peak winds occur at lower altitudes to the south, also seen in the NCEP July climatology of  The over-strong monsoon flow and associated northward migration of the ITCZ in the mid-range forecast resulted in the weak geostrophic jet winds in earlier model versions, which depend on the contrast between the dry and moist convective regions to the north and south, respectively. The more accurate radiative forcing associated with the improved aerosol climatology prevents the northward ITCZ migration and thus allows the AEJ to be sustained in the forecast. Aerosols can alter the atmospheric circulation through their direct radiative forcing. Here, the impact of an improved aerosol climatology on 5-day forecasts of the African Easterly jet is examined. A pair of 5-day forecasts were compared to high resolution dropsonde data from the JET2000 campaign. The first forecast used the annually fixed aerosol climatology of  It is proposed that the modification suppresses deep convection by stabilizing the atmosphere, preventing the ITCZ from progressively migrating north during the forecast. A strong reduction in PBL θ e is noted, and thus a feedback between deep convection and low level moist advection is also likely to play a role. Future work will investigate the wider implications for this change on the large-scale circulation through teleconnections."
224,dust aerosol ocean,"Suppression of deep convection over the tropical North Atlantic by the Saharan Air Layer. The effects of the dust-laden Saharan Air Layer SAL on the occurrence of deep convection over the eastern and central tropical North Atlantic Ocean off-shore of the African continent during August - September 2002 are investigated. We show that the SAL is associated with suppressed convection in this region. To determine the possible cause of the suppressed convection, the thermodynamic structure and dust content of the SAL are investigated. We find that the SAL is associated with warmer and dryer air below 700 hPa with the largest temperature anomalies located around 850 hPa. This warm and dry air layer raises the lifting condensation level and level of free convection, and increases the energetic barrier to convection that leads to reduced occurrence of deep convection. . During late spring until early fall, it is advected westward from the African continent across the North Atlantic Ocean. Recently, Dunion and Velden . Studies of analysis increment in data assimilation suggested that Saharan dust may modify the atmospheric temperature structure over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean and modulate African easterly waves, which in turn plays a role in modulating the development of TCs. on the Terra satellite are first used to establish a connection between dust amount and deep convection over the tropical North Atlantic. The dust amount is then used as a proxy to construct the composites of National Center of Environmental Prediction/National Center of Atmospheric Research NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data to identify the meteorological structure of the SAL, which is then related to the suppression of deep convection.. The aerosol properties are archived in the MOD04 level-2 product. The AOT data over ocean have been validated with data from other satellites or ground-based network. We then average the retrieved daytime aerosol optical thickness AOT at 0.55 μm into 1° × 1° boxes covering the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. To insure spatial aerosol homogeneity, boxes where the standard deviations of AOT are greater than 20% of the averages are not used in our analyses.. The 11-μm brightness temperatures and the cloud mask are available in the MOD06 level-2 product, both subsetted from native 1-km resolution down to 5-km. Only daytime data are used in order to match the timing of the aerosol retrievals. For every 1° × 1° box on a particular day, a histogram of the cloud-pixel brightness temperatures is constructed. Only boxes having more than 100 cloudy pixels about 20% of a box's area are used in order to assure that the histogram is a representative of the boxes' convective activity. We have tested that the number of cloudy pixels in a box is uncorrelated with the box-averaged AOT and, therefore, no bias is introduced by this assumption of minimum cloudy pixels in a box.  Figure 1 shows the monthly mean geographical distributions of the averaged AOT and the air-mass convergence below 850 hPa represented by the subtraction of the vertical velocity at 850 hPa from that at 1000 hPa, using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data over the two regions for August and September 2002. One can clearly see that dust amount decreases as air moves westward into the central tropical North Atlantic Ocean. The distributions of the convergence, with positive negative values meaning low-level convergence divergence , show clearly the location of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone ITCZ between 10° and 15°N, with smaller values of convergence extending in the eastern portion of the domain to 15°–20°N. The last columns of Tables 1 and 2 show the composites of the air-mass convergence below 850 hPa versus the AOT. To form these composites, we associate with each 1° × 1° box the vertical velocity profile from the 2.5° × 2.5° reanalysis grid point closest to the center of the 1° × 1° box and average the air-mass convergence for each of the AOT ranges. There is no evidence of correlations between the AOT and the convergence, implying that the suppression of deep convection when the SAL is present is not related to the variation in large-scale low-level convergence e.g., seasonal shift of the ITCZ . However, we should note that the reanalysis data used here are at a coarse resolution that cannot capture smaller-scale convergence. This remains an uncertainty of our analysis that requires future investigations.Monthly mean aerosol optical thickness from MODIS and air-mass convergence below 850 hPa from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis over the central and eastern tropical North Atlantic Ocean in August and September 2002. The convergence is computed as the difference of vertical velocity Pa s −1 between 1000 hPa and 850 hPa. Positive negative values represent low-level convergence divergence . The zero lines are represented by the dashed lines.. The vertical profiles of the temperature anomalies are consistent with that of the inferred heating rates by dust from analysis increments. Dunion and Velden  Over the central tropical North Atlantic Ocean the left panel , the amount of dust is less probably due to loss of dust by sedimentation and there are many fewer 1° × 1° boxes with average AOT of 0.9–3, so only results for the three other ranges of AOT are shown. The temperature anomalies at 850 hPa are smaller than those in the eastern tropical North Atlantic Ocean. Higher dust amount is still associated with warmer temperature anomalies Figure 2 . On the other hand, the specific humidity anomalies at 850 hPa in this region do not decrease monotonically with the increase of dust amount. Dunion and Velden  The noon-time NCEP/NCAR reanalysis temperature and specific humidity in the regions for August–September 2002 are used to calculate the virtual temperature profiles, which are then used to compute the convection barriers associated with various AOT values. In the real atmosphere, the initial parcel level can be at any altitude below the LCL. In our computation of the convection barrier, we have used the conventional choice of an initial parcel level that yields the maximum Convective Available Potential Energy CAPE value. This conventional choice gives an upper limit estimate for the probability of occurrence of deep convection and is, therefore, a conservative choice. Tables 1 and 2 list the composites of convection barriers for different ranges of AOT over the eastern and central tropical North Atlantic Ocean, respectively. The probabilities of having cloud brightness temperatures that are less than 250 K decrease with increasing convection barriers within each region. In conclusion, the temperature inversion generated by the warmer and dryer SAL reduces the occurrence of deep convection by strengthening the convection barrier..[16]  In this study, we mainly discuss the suppression of deep convection by the SAL. However, near the eastern and southern edges of the SAL, the enhanced wind shear associated with the strong temperature gradient is an important factor affecting the occurrence of deep convection. It will be interesting to use available satellite and reanalysis data to investigate the relation between the coherency of the SAL, the African easterly wave, wind-shear and deep convection. The relative importance of the radiative heating by dust compared to other dynamical mechanisms e.g., African easterly wave in generating and maintaining the meteorological properties of the SAL is still unknown."
225,climate aerosol ocean,"The origin of water soluble particulate iron in the Asian atmospheric outflow. Iron, and in particular water soluble iron, is an important trace nutrient in the surface ocean, and therefore an important component in the global carbon cycle. Deposition of Asian aerosol is thought to be a primary source of water soluble iron in the northern Pacific. Analysis of aerosol samples obtained during the Aerosol Characterization Experiment ACE -Asia field campaign from Jeju Island, Korea, which intercepts the outflow from the Asian continent, shows that water soluble iron is not dominated by mineral dust sources even during large dust storms. Instead, our analysis indicates that particulate soluble iron and elemental carbon concentrations are correlated. This leads to the conclusion that soluble iron in this region is strongly connected to anthropogenic activity and not connected to mineral dust emissions, especially if the budget averaged over annual time scales is considered. . By influencing pCO 2 in the atmosphere, carbon fixation in the oceans may affect the radiative balance of the planet. Models and ice core data suggest that variations in the atmospheric flux of iron to the HNLC Pacific have regulated marine production over the past four glacial cycles. Biological primary production has been predicted to be very sensitive to the fraction iron that is soluble when deposited into the surface ocean.. Recently, . Relevant to this study, samples of total suspended particulates TSP, which has an upper size limit of 60 μm were collected daily between March 31 and May 2, 2001. The collected aerosol was analyzed for elemental carbon EC and organic carbon OC using the standard ACE-Asia technique. Total Fe soluble and insoluble , along with other metals, were measured for the TSP aerosol samples which includes both fine and coarse aerosol modes using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry ICP and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ICP-MS from acid digests of the aerosol samples. Soluble Fe was measured in Milli-Q water extracts using ICP, and is assumed to be primarily ferrous rather than the much less soluble ferric iron. The use of unbuffered Milli-Q water instead of seawater to infer soluble Fe could lead to differences in the absolute amounts of soluble Fe. However, the results reported here rely on the relative amounts of soluble Fe. Previous studies suggest that the use of seawater would enhance soluble Fe from anthropogenic sources of Fe relative to crustal Fe, and therefore, if anything, these results are biased towards increasing the contribution of crustal Fe. Details of the iron analysis methods and further discussion of this issue are presented in the auxiliary materials .Map of the ACE-Asia experimental region with the Gosan Kosan and Dunhuang sites identified., and is used to characterize recently resuspended aeolian dust. Based on back trajectory analyses, the air masses sampled at Gosan during the dust events passed within a few hundred kilometers of Dunhuang, therefore it is reasonable to consider that the dust at Dunhuang is fairly representative of the source region of the Gosan dust aerosol. The conclusion that dust is not a major source of soluble Fe is supported by other observations during ACE-Asia. To further address the question of sulfuric acid attack of dust, we examine measured aerosol sulfate concentrations. Of the days that we label “high dust”, two exhibited particularly high SO 4 concentrations ranked 1 and 4 among all samples . The soluble Fe concentrations on these days were not notably high; the first was slightly above average, the other considerably below average. Looking at the data as a whole, SO 4 exhibits very little correlation with soluble Fe data not shown; correlation coefficient [2004] concluded that during the dust storm of April 9 to 13, aerosol sulfate and nitrate was neutralized either by dust or ammonia and therefore not present as acids. In such a situation, acid processing cannot occur downwind. However, our data cannot definitively rule out this mechanism and we therefore leave this issue as a subject for further study.[20]  Analysis of aerosol data from Gosan, Korea during ACE-Asia leads to a number of conclusions relevant to particulate iron in the Asian outflow:[21]  1. Dust storms do not exhibit enhanced soluble Fe levels relative to their source region, or relative to non-dust days. Also, soluble Fe is not correlated with insoluble Fe. These two observations leads to the conclusion that processing of insoluble Fe during dust storms is not a significant contributor to soluble Fe at Gosan.[22]  2. The observed correlation between soluble Fe and EC is surprisingly strong given that a number of other variables are expected to influence this relationship. This leads us to conclude that anthropogenic activity is a key factor in particulate soluble Fe concentrations. We believe that the most likely mechanism is the emission of soluble Fe from combustion sources, but our data do not permit testing of this hypothesis.[23]  3. Annually averaged, soluble Fe from dust storms is a minimal contributor, while anthropogenic activity appears to be a primary contributor in the Asian outflow."
226,ocean,"Simulating the cloud processing of iron in Australian dust: pH and dust concentration. We report on the simulated cloud processing of an aerosol iron sample derived from an Australian dust storm. Primary factors influencing the extent and rate of Fe mobilization were pH, duration of extraction and dust concentration. Fe was significantly mobilized below a threshold of pH similar to 3.6. After initial rapid mobilization at low pH, the rate of Fe release was constant with constant pH. Between this threshold and pH similar to 7.1, dissolved Fe fell to a minimum but above this pH further dissolution of iron occurs, probably due to the formation of soluble ferrates. At our lowest dust concentrations 1 - 20 mg L -1 the rate of Fe extraction at low pH was constant, while at higher dust concentrations the rate was inversely proportional to dust concentration. Dissolution of iron from dust is thus a complex process and these factors must be considered when modeling the input of iron to the oceans. , particularly in High Nitrate Low Chlorophyll HNLC oceans such as the Southern Ocean. Recent studies have highlighted the complexity of dust transport above the Southern Ocean and aspects of the atmospheric processing and transport of iron-rich Australian mineral dust are presented in Figure 1 . It is evident that important questions remain concerning the fate of iron-laden dust within clouds. In this study we examined the degree to which pH and dust concentration provide bounding values for the extent and rate of Fe mobilization from Australian dust, and compare these with studies of finely grained Saharan dust and with model calculations for the extent of Fe mobilization.Schematic representing atmospheric processing of dust. Dust is formed from soil in the Australian Outback then uplifted and dispersed before wet. The dust Munsell color is light brown, 7.5YR 6/4. Dust particle-size was measured by Coulter Multisizer. The minimally-dispersed sample has a modal size of 14.09 μm and a mean size of 17.08 μm. The surface area per gram was calculated to be 0.3 m 2 g −1 by assuming ρ dust = ρ silica = 2.65 g cm −3 ., H 2 SO 4 was chosen as a known component of cloud water. Dust was added dry, except for the dust concentration experiments in which dust was added as a measured volume of freshly made slurry in MQ water. Stirring was provided magnetically and samples were pumped through 0.2 μm cellulose membrane filters. After each sampling event, the filter was disconnected and pump flow was reversed to return solution to the main vessel from tubing. Analysis of Fe was by graphite furnace AAS and cathodic stripping voltammetry.. To simulate changes experienced by dust, pH was cycled between low <2.9 and high ∼8 pH several times. Results Figure 2 were in agreement with similar experiments using fine grained Saharan aerosol with a high Fe content in that % Fe T decreased rapidly with increasing pH but was also able to be remobilized equally rapidly to prior levels when pH was lowered again. Results also agreed with those of = 2.5 mg L −1 and pH 3.2 dashed line , and pH values ∼1–1.5 have been inferred from modelling studies. Trials were carried out at pH 4.5, 3.9, 3.6, 3.2, 2.9, 2.6, 2.2 and 1.9. Each trial used a dust concentration of between 3.8 and 6.3 mg L −1 . A threshold between pH 3.2–3.6 was observed Figure 3a , in agreement with the finding that the rate of dissolution of Fe from Saharan dust approaches a minimum at pH 3.8. Above this pH there was negligible release of Fe over the 48–168 h time scale relevant to transportation from Australia to Southern Ocean HNLC waters Figure 1 . Below a pH of 2.9 the release was >5% Fe T in 120 hours, with an interpolated mobilization of 2% Fe T occurring at pH 3.15 over this time, in contrast with model calculations requiring pH <2 for mobilization of 2% Fe T . After 120 hours extraction, the pH in each trial was gradually raised toward the threshold pH to simulate the neutralization process that occurs as acidic cloud droplets approach the pH of rain Figure 1 . Results show % Fe T decreased with increasing pH, reaching 0 % Fe T at pH 3.7 Figure 3b , in excellent agreement with the pH threshold for mobilization. a % Fe T after 120 hours extraction at varying pH shows a threshold value for negligible extraction occurs at pH 3.2–3.6. b Immobilization and remobilization of Fe with increase in pH. After 120 hours extraction at acidic pH, the pH was gradually raised. Initial pH of extraction 1.9 open squares , 2.3 open circles , 2.6 solid diamonds and 2.9 solid triangles .. Thus, we raised the pH to simulate this and found a second threshold, of 7.1, where dissolved Fe increased by approximately 1% Fe T for each pH unit above pH 7.1 Figure 3b . We believe this dissolution is due to the formation of soluble ferrates, Fe OH 4 −1 but, because of the confounding presence of Al, SO 4 2− and other salts, the precise soluble species can not be identified with certainty. At pH 10, ∼40% of the Fe that was originally mobilized by extraction at low pH and was then immobilized by raising the pH above 3.8 had been remobilized.. Under more acidic conditions 2.3 ≥ pH ≥ 1.9 the rate of extraction was similar to that at higher pH, % Fe T = 0.063t + 5.1, 2.3 ≥ pH ≥ 1.9 t > 24, r 2 0.96, n = 7 , but this only applied after an initial rapid increase over the first 24 hours.% Fe T with time for pH 2.9 solid triangles, dotted line , 2.6 open diamonds, solid line , 2.3 solid circles, dotted line – excludes marked point half filled circle and 1.9 open squares, solid line . Dust concentration in air, and therefore clouds, is related to transport time by the half-decrease distance. The dust concentration within cloud droplets is poorly characterized and must, in any event, change markedly between hydration and evaporation cycles Figure 1 . Dissolution of Fe occurs at the surface of particles, thus the surface area of individual particles and the dust concentration,.Effect of mgL −1y = at + b, for was labile and was released during the equilibration period before the addition of the acid, while for concentrations of dust < 20 mg L −1 , the release during equilibration was too low to be quantified mg L −1 3.2 black , 6.2 checks , 20.2 diagonal lines , 25.5 dots , 55 white and107 grey . Inset shows rate nmol h −1 for t = 1 against but even short lived events within clouds that alter pH can significantly and rapidly alter the proportion of extractable Fe mobilized. The rate of mobilization is influenced by the concentration of dust – which, in turn, is expected to vary with duration of transport. These interactions must be considered in order to make current models for the cloud processing of dust more realistic. For a further synthesis to occur, the fraction of extractable iron that is bioavailable must also be quantified."
229,aerosol,"Comment on ""Relative importance of climate and land use in determining present and future global soil dust emission'' by I. Tegen et al..  . As noted by . Here we constrain the land use fraction of emission with observations of dust storm frequency following  The dust storm frequency dataset used for this study is identical to that used by to be ∼4.7e-6 kg/kg for standard conditions. In the data, if there is an observation at the meteorological station any time within the day when the visibility goes below 1 km, it counts as a dust storm day. In order to account for the large spatial and temporal heterogeneities in concentration within one grid box, we use 40 times the concentration for criteria 1, and 20 times the concentration for criteria 2. We chose these two values to give us slopes between the model and data that are on either side of 1.0, and allow us to test the sensitivity to our assumptions about spatial and temporal heterogeneity within a grid box to the resulting slope and correlation coefficient. Model results suggest that grid-averaged concentrations can vary by a factor of 2–10 during one day. Satellite pictures of desert dust plume show that plumes can be as small as a few km wide while our grid box is 180 km × 180 km e.g., http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=12178 suggesting that these 20x and 40x factors relating daily and grid-box averaged values to a maximum value observed within the box are reasonable. Factors between 5 and 100 yield qualitatively similar results for the correlation coefficient statistical significance. and , National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and the dust entrainment and deposition model which has been shown to compare well to observations for a 0–50% land use source. Daily averaged model results for 7 years are included in this study 1984–1991, with 1987 missing due to accidentally missing daily values ., and we use the . To go from a 0% to a 50% source, we keep total global emissions constant, but vary our global emission factor for the natural and cultivation source such that the emissions are 0 to 50% from land use. Thus the differences between this study and   Table 1 shows the correlation coefficient and slope between the model and observed number of dust storm days at each station. Notice that using a concentration criteria results in a better correlation and slope for all the different scenarios. Ideally we want a slope of 1.0, which is achieved somewhere between our criteria 1 and 2 see Table 1 The highest correlation is for the case when land use is 0 or 10% or 10–50% of the total source depending on the criteria used . Notice that results for 10–50% land use for the source scheme are identical in our case because of the linear addition of land use, and the dust storm days being defined as any day with source above 0. Also included in Table 1 is the probability that the correlation coefficients are statistically significantly different than the highest value. This shows that for most cases, 0–50% land use are not statistically significantly different than the highest correlation at 95 percentile although they are almost statistically significant . Note that we do not have Gaussian distributions, which is a criteria for statistical significance tests; if we use rank correlations instead, for which we know the distribution and which has a clear statistical significance test, we obtain qualitatively similar results. Notice that the correlations between the model and observations are quite close for the different cases, and this is seen in the probability that each is different than the highest being low for most cases Table 1 . The data is not able to discriminate between the different cases, probably due to the strong similarity in the dust sources and concentrations between 0–50% land use sources.Three criteria for dust storms are used for the model results: source criteria and two concentration criteria described in the text. H refers to the highest correlation, while the number in parenthesis is the probability that the result is statistically significant. Bold numbers show the values which are not statistically significantly different at the 95% than the highest value., estimating the importance of land use from global models is difficult because of the overlap between human and natural sources and the downwind transport of dust. Sources of dust are thought to be very small scale, and it may be that constraining the portion that are due to land use requires field work, not global studies using models or satellite data."
231,dust particles aerosol clouds,"Characterization of Asian dust and Siberian smoke with multiwavelength Raman lidar over Tokyo, Japan in spring 2003. [ 1] In the spring of 2003, we observed lofted Asian dust and Siberian forest-fire smoke plumes in the free troposphere over Tokyo, Japan with a dual-wavelength Raman lidar. These data show clear signatures of the optical characteristics depending on the aerosol type. The Asian-dust layer shows that the particle depolarization ratio PDR at 532 nm is -20%, and the extinction-to-backscatter ratio lidar ratio at 355 nm is -49 sr, which is close to -43 sr measured at 532 nm. On the contrary, the smoke layers show that the PDR is as small as 5-8% or less, and the lidar ratio at 355 nm is -40 sr, which is considerably lower than -65 sr which was measured at 532 nm. We also applied an inversion algorithm for the smoke case. The effective radius was -0.22 mm and the single-scattering albedo at 532 nm was -0.95. . They also serve as cloud condensation nuclei and modulate the cloud properties. East Asia is considered as a region where emission of anthropogenic aerosols is rapidly increasing due to growing economy. Recently, the Asia-Pacific Regional Aerosol Characterization Experiment ACE-Asia showed that the spatial variability of aerosol composition and properties is rather high in this area. It has also been shown that mineral dust has an indirect effect on clouds by serving as effective ice nuclei. Therefore, it is highly important to study not only column-averaged but also height-resolved aerosol optical properties regularly.. From the point of view of feasibility, we installed a UV-Raman lidar system that emits the third harmonic frequency 355 nm on the basis of a second Nd:YAG laser in addition to our existing lidar system at Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology TUMST; 35.66°N, 139.80°E . Thus our lidar system is capable of measuring backscatter coefficients at 355, 532, 1064 nm, extinction coefficients at 355 and 532 nm, particle depolarization ratio at 532 nm, and water–vapor mixing ratio, simultaneously. To our knowledge, this is the first dual-wavelength Raman lidar installed in East Asia. In this short contribution, we demonstrate how the dual-wavelength Raman lidar can be used for the characterization of optical properties of aerosols observed during regional aerosol events that occurred successively. We briefly outline the lidar system in section 2 . Section 3 presents results of observations for Asian dust and Siberian forest-fire smoke in the spring of 2003 with emphasis on the aerosol characterization by observed aerosol optical properties, and the microphysical parameters of the smoke derived from the inversion code.. The repetition frequencies of the laser pulses are 10 Hz. The data were stored every 4,094 shots, i.e., ∼7 minutes. Both analog and photon-counting methods of the photo-multipliers are employed with transient recorders TR20-160, Licel . Typical operating laser powers are approximately 100, 100, 200 mJ per pulse for the 355, 532 and 1064 nm laser beams. Full overlap between the telescope field of view and the laser beams occurs 1–1.5 km height depending on the receivers. The backscatter ratio at 355 nm and the water-vapor mixing ratio are evaluated down to ∼100 m above ground level, because we can take the geometrical form factor identical for the channels that detect the elastic signal and the inelastic Raman signals. However, it is not the case for the 532-nm backscatter ratio, because we used different receivers for the elastic and the N 2 -Raman channels.. The atmospheric density profile was calculated from routine radiosonde observations at Tateno 36.05°N, 140.12°E; ∼60 km away from TUMST at 12 UTC. The extinction profiles at 355 and 532 nm were derived for the Asian dust case after applying a sliding average to the range-corrected N 2 -Raman signals for 5 points 600 m above 5.0 and 1.4 km, respectively. Similarly, for the smoke case, the extinction profiles at 355 and 532 nm were derived after applying the sliding average to the range-corrected N 2 -Raman signals for 3 points 360 m only above 4.5 and 3.7 km, respectively. The backscatter coefficient at 1064 nm is obtained from the Mie-Rayleigh signal by using the method proposed by  In addition, Figure 2 shows another interesting differences of the aerosol optical properties besides the large difference of the PDR in the layers A and B. The BAE in layer A ∼1.2 is higher than in layer B ∼0.3 , which suggests that layer A might be composed of smaller aerosols. Since the relative humidity in layers A and B are nearly identical ∼40% , we can reject the assumption that hygroscopic growth of mineral dust reduces the depolarization ratio.. Smoke plumes originating from these fires were transported over Japan with westerly wind. Figure 3 shows a time-height plot of the backscatter coefficient and the total depolarization ratio at 532 nm on 21 May 2003. Back trajectory analyses show that the airmass from 2 to 4 km originated in regions of intense forestfire which occurred from west of Lake Baykal to east of the border of China, Russia and Mongolia not shown . The smoke layer sharply dropped off at ∼4 km. The upper part 3–4 km of the smoke layer showed a depolarization ratio of about 6%. A similar feature was also observed in Suwon 37.14°N, 127.04°E , Korea.As in Figure 1 , except for 21 May 2003. The relationship between S 355 and S 532 , i.e., S 532 > S 355 , and the non-negligible particle depolarization ratio is consistent with lidar observations of aged smoke from Canada over central Europe during the Lindenberg Aerosol Characterization Experiment LACE98. A part of this Siberian smoke was also detected over central Europe and showed the same relationship between S 355 and S 532 . The non-zero depolarization ratio might be caused by soil material that was uplifted into the forest fire plume, or the nonsphericity of the particles due to coagulation of smoke particles. The latter explanation seems more reasonable because no signature of mineral dust was found from a chemical analysis of aerosols sampled at the summit of Mt. Fuji 3,776 m above sea level and ∼100 km west of Tokyo in the same period N. Kaneyasu, private communication, 2004 .. These authors also reported a significant positive curvature for the relationship of the log τ a versus log λ . The analysis of the collocated TUMST skyradiometer POM-01, Prede daytime observations with respect to this relationship shows a similar tendency not shown .. For the moment we cannot apply the inversion code for the case of Asian dust which possesses a high PDR, i.e., the particle have a non-spherical shape, because it has been developed for the case of particles of spherical shape. We found 0.22 ±0.04 μm for the effective radius surface-weighted mean radius and 0.95 ±0.06 for the single scattering albedo SSA at 532 nm around the peak of the smoke layer. Figure 5 shows effective radius and single scattering albedo for selected height ranges. The results indicate that particles in the accumulation mode are dominant, which is a typical feature for the case of smoke. The relatively high SSA indicates low absorbing particles.Vertical variation of microphysical particle properties for the lidar measurements from 1040 to 1349 UTC on 21 May 2003 over TUMST in Tokyo, Japan. Horizontal error bars are the standard deviation of the parameters. Vertical error bars describe the height ranges across which the optical data were averaged and used for the data inversion..[15]  The distinct optical signatures for mineral dust and aged smoke presented here demonstrate how multi-wavelength Raman lidar can be used for a height-resolved characterization of tropospheric aerosols. For the Asian dust case we found a high PDR of more than 20% at 532 nm and a small wavelength dependence of the lidar ratio between 355 and 532 nm 43–49 sr , for the smoke case we found a small PDR less than 5–8% and a high wavelength dependence of the lidar ratio: S 355 is ∼40 sr, while S 532 is ∼65 sr. We also successfully derived the climate-relevant microphysical parameters, e.g. effective radius and single scattering albedo, for the smoke case. Mean values of the effective radius varied between 0.2–0.25 μm and the mean single scattering albedo was 0.92–0.97 at 532 nm. Such advanced Raman lidar is an essential tool for the characterization of the complex aerosols found over East Asia and have great potential for application in global aerosol lidar networking in future."
232,climate aerosol,"Modeling Arabian dust mobilization during the Asian summer monsoon: The effect of prescribed versus calculated SST. [ 1] Emission of soil or 'mineral' dust aerosol over the Arabian Peninsula during the Northern Hemisphere NH summer monsoon increases in response to dust radiative forcing in an atmospheric general circulation model AGCM with prescribed sea surface temperature SST . Radiative heating within the dust layer reinforces the monsoon circulation, which is further strengthened by column latent heating through a wind-evaporative feedback. The strengthened circulation raises additional dust into the atmosphere over Arabia. In contrast, this positive feedback is absent when SST is calculated by the AGCM using a mixed-layer ocean. This discrepancy results from the surface energy constraint in the mixed-layer experiment, where surface evaporation is decreased by the reduction of sunlight beneath the dust layer. In contrast, evaporation and column latent heating increase in the prescribed SST experiment, where the surface energy constraint is absent. Realization of the positive feedback exhibited by the prescribed SST experiment requires that anomalous ocean heat transport which is not included here balance the surface radiative forcing by dust.  and mediation of atmospheric chemistry to direct radiative forcing. Changes to the atmospheric circulation by dust radiative forcing have been calculated by numerous studies. Because lifting or ‘emission’ of dust into the atmosphere is closely related to the surface wind, circulation changes driven by dust feed back upon the aerosol load. In the current climate, this feedback is negative, reducing the global emission of dust by roughly 15%, according to two AGCM experiments that include dust as a tracer. The two AGCMs are identical except for their lower boundary condition: SST is prescribed by  In this article, we attribute the contrasting feedbacks to the lower boundary condition adopted by each AGCM. The presence of a surface energy budget only in the mixed layer experiment results in a contrasting surface wind response to the reduction of sunlight beneath the dust layer. The effect of the surface energy budget upon the temperature and precipitation response to dust has been noted by . The resulting global average single scatter albedo, which depends upon the contribution of each particle size category, is 0.906. Because of global variations in aerosol mineralogy along with uncertainty in Saharan dust properties, two additional experiments with dust radiative forcing are carried out where the particle single scatter albedo is either decreased corresponding to increased absorption or increased corresponding to increased reflection by 10%. In the latter case, the single scatter albedo is not allowed to exceed unity. For brevity, we present only the experiments with enhanced absorption denoted by ‘0.9ϖ’ in Figure 1 , because the effect of the lower boundary condition upon JJA emission is most apparent. According to Figure 1 , the emission contrast is smaller for more reflecting particles denoted by ‘1.1ϖ’ and intermediate for Saharan particles denoted by ‘1.0ϖ’ . In the conclusions, we discuss the relevance of the experiments with enhanced absorption. In the mixed-layer experiment, dust radiative forcing reduces the aerosol load almost everywhere.   Figures 2c and 2d show the anomalous wind speed. The unperturbed monsoon circulation consists of easterly flow along the equator, turning to southerly flow along the east African coast and southwesterly flow across the Arabian Sea and Indian subcontinent toward the Bay of Bengal Figure 3 . In the experiment with prescribed SST, the increased dust load is associated with a strengthening of the surface winds across the southern Arabian peninsula. In addition, the wind anomaly augments the southwesterly monsoonal flow along the Arabian coast.Climatological surface wind speed m s −1 and direction during NH summer for the mixed-layer experiment without dust radiative forcing. In contrast, the anomalous diabatic heating is much smaller in the mixed-layer experiment Figure 2f . This contrast is almost entirely due to the comparatively small anomaly of column latent heating in the mixed-layer experiment Figure 4f . This results from the negative anomaly of the surface latent heat flux along the Arabian coast Figure 4d . In the absence of a column latent heating anomaly, the circulation change is comparatively modest Figure 2d . In the prescribed SST experiment, dust radiative forcing enhances the NH summer monsoon circulation, increasing evaporation along the Arabian coast. This leads to additional diabatic heating by latent heat release, further intensifying the monsoon circulation. The strengthened circulation raises additional dust over Arabia. In contrast, evaporation decreases in the mixed layer experiment, in response to the reduction of sunlight beneath the dust layer. In the absence of a column latent heating anomaly that would augment radiative heating within the dust layer, the change in the monsoon circulation and Arabian dust emission is negligible... The anomalous column latent heating in response to BC radiative forcing is geographically similar to the anomaly in Figure 4e associated with a strengthened monsoon circulation and increased Arabian dust emission.. In the prescribed SST experiment, dust reduces the surface heat gain by roughly one-half. A consideration of ocean dynamics must be included to determine whether the positive feedback upon emission can be realized."
234,aerosol ocean,"Short residence time for iron in surface seawater impacted by atmospheric dry deposition from Saharan dust events. Measurements of dissolved DFe and total iron TFe in the upper water column are presented from the German SOLAS Surface Ocean - Lower Atmosphere Study cruise M55 , along a west to east transect at 10degreesN, in the equatorial Atlantic in October/November 2002. Aerosol samples were collected simultaneously during this time and are used to estimate an iron flux to the surface waters. Resulting flux estimates combined with iron inventories in the near surface waters reveal extremely short fractional mean residence times 6-62 days for total dissolved and particulate iron in waters directly under the path of Saharan dust plumes. These results suggest that individual dust storms can supply a significant amount of the present iron upper water column inventory which is subsequent rapidly removed by aggregation and sinking. . The low concentrations of DFe found in surface seawater are a product of the low solubility of the thermodynamically favoured redox state, Fe III , which rapidly forms, or is scavenged by, colloidal and particulate phases. The dissolved forms of Fe are dominated by complexation with organic ligands which increase the overall solubility and are thought to be more bioavailable to phytoplankton. Thus it is of great importance to determine the sources and fluxes of Fe to the remote ocean and to understand the biogeochemical processes occurring in the exchange between atmosphere/river and ocean. may represent the dominant source to the open ocean, as mineral dust typically has a composition similar to continental crust ∼4.3% Fe w/w . Dust inputs are episodic and occur by either wet or dry deposition resulting in a typical surface enrichment of surface Fe concentrations. The North Atlantic Ocean receives some of the largest dust inputs of the major oceans due to its proximity to the major dust source regions of arid North Africa with major storms tending to occur in the winter and spring. There is no single or continuous source of ‘Saharan’ dust but rather several source regions with differing chemistries. The direction of the dust flux follows a seasonal cycle, associated with the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone ITCZ , with the zone of maximum dust transport from the African coast moving from 5°N in winter to 20°N in summer.. The supply of Fe to North Atlantic surface waters is now thought to be responsible for stimulating N 2 fixation in the cental gyre and thus acting to ameliorate the effects of nitrogen limitation on the overall phytoplankton community. Though recently evidence has been presented for the possibility of phosphorus limitation or phosphorus co-limitation with Fe of N 2 fixation. The role of Fe in N 2 fixation during the present work is discussed in a companion paper. . The ship track is also shown in red.. Samples were drawn into 1 L trace metal clean low density polyethylene bottles for later analysis in the laboratory. Filtered samples were collected using slight N 2 overpressure and filtration through 0.2 μm filter cartridges Sartorius .. Analytical figures of merit for the analysis can be found in the online supplementary materials . Water column inventories of DFe and TFe were estimated using the trapezoidal rule over the upper 200 m of the water column; this region includes not only the mixed layer but the region of the thermocline and the area where convective mixing occurs... Because deposition velocities are rather poorly known, the derived deposition fluxes are subject to an inherent uncertainty of around a factor of 3.. The Fe:Ca value used in the present study may slightly over estimate the true iron flux as air mass back trajectories and K/Ca ratios in the aerosol indicated the Northern Fe:Ca = 0.65 ± 0.21 and Central Sahara Fe:Ca = 1.03 ± 0.23 as the potential source region for the dust., assuming a constant Fe inventory. Here we estimate a fractional mean residence time, τ i , from the equation, τ i = , where M is the inventory and J i the dry atmospheric flux. The variability in τ i , is derived from the uncertainty in the deposition velocity 300% . We note that the episodic nature of dust events implies a non-steady state input of iron and can increase iron inventories for some time; related to the deposition history of the water parcel. While such events invalidate the assumptions inherent in the model, a more comprehensive approach would require longer term studies. Using this approach we estimate a residence time for the iron deposited by dry deposition during the previous day – this provides a time scale, or response time, with which to examine the kinetics of other processes that affect iron cycling. The overall mean residence time for iron τ is then related to the sum of all the fluxes Σ J i , including upwelling and wet deposition, and is given by .. These stations contrast strongly with the much lower DFe and TFe concentrations found at the equator station 24 , which was outside the influence of the Saharan dust plume. A key feature of all of the profiles was a distinct minimum in TFe just under the base of the mixed layer, possibly indicating a zone of greatest scavenging. Previous work on Fe in the equatorial Atlantic have shown similar results, showing elevated surface Fe concentrations, from mostly north-south transects across the Saharan dust plume.Vertical profiles from selected stations during M55 showing effects of atmospheric iron deposition. Green – total, blue – dissolved ..  Mean fractional residence times for TFe were remarkably short ranging from 6 range 2–12 days –62 range 21–186 days, with the shortest times associated with high dust flux. Use of the mixed layer alone 20–50 m would reduce these times by a factor of 4–10. These values are similar to estimates for the Sargasso Sea of ∼18 days and considerably shorter than the residence time estimates for Fe in the global ocean of ∼100 years. Estimates for the residence time of DFe are critically dependent on the estimation of the aerosol Fe solubility here taken as 1%. Our values indicate a residence time of between 280 range 86–840 days and 10.5 range 3–5–31.6 years, significantly longer than estimates for the Sargasso Sea of 214–291 days. Our values are probably overestimates as in regions of high deposition the surface seawater is essentially saturated with respect to truly DFe and the principal factor affecting DFe is the rate of transformation into particulate material via biological or abiotic processes. Significant wet deposition with higher iron solubilities, a process not considered here, would also act to reduce the overall residence time for DFe.[17]  Our results here clearly show that in regions of high dust deposition, particulate Fe has a very short residence time in the upper water column with implications for dissolution and scavenging processes. Further work is required to examine Fe residence times in the critical interface between the atmosphere and ocean which all aerosol particles must cross – the sea surface microlayer."
235,dust impact aerosol,"Observation of enhanced water vapor in Asian dust layer and its effect on atmospheric radiative heating rates. This study investigates the effect of water vapor associated with mineral dust aerosols on atmospheric radiative heating rates using ground-based lidar, aircraft, radiosonde measurements and a radiation model during Asian dust events in the spring of 2001. We found enhanced levels of water vapor within the dust layer relative to the air above and below the dust layer. The water vapor led to an increase in the net radiative heating rate within the dust layer, changing the heating rate vertical structure. A net cooling was calculated above the dust layer as a result of low aerosol and drier conditions. Our finding suggests that the presence of water vapor within dust layer acts to enhance the temperature of this layer, potentially influencing the static stability of the dust layer. This finding is supported by an increase in the potential temperature at the top and bottom of the dust layer. . Previous studies suggest that atmospheric mineral dust causes significant atmospheric radiative heating in solar wavelengths SW and a cooling in long wavelengths LW . This effect of dust on radiative heating/cooling rates can affect the atmospheric temperature profile and thermodynamics.  This study presents an analysis of the radiative heating rates of the Asian dust layer with and without water vapor under the cloud-free conditions. The model of the radiative heating/cooling rates of the dust layer in both the SW and the LW regions uses surface and aircraft measurement data as input. measurements of the Asian dust at Gosan 33.29N, 126.16E , South Korea in the spring of 2001. Radiosonde observations of the vertical profile of pressure P , temperature T and relative humidity RH were made twice daily at the site by the Korea Meteorological Administration. Measurements of the aerosol extinction coefficient as well as vertical profiles of meteorological parameters such as P, T and RH were obtained aboard the C-130 research aircraft during the ACE-Asia field campaign. The usual entrainment process of Asian mineral dust into the lower or middle troposphere is by a cyclonic depression and frontal system that sweep over the arid and semi-arid regions of China and Mongolia. The dust is further transported by strong westerly jets. The atmosphere usually is considered to be dry during dust events. However, we found elevated levels of WVMR within the Asian dust layer ADL relative to the air above and below the ADL. On April 13, 2001, Figure 1b , the WVMR in the dust plume at 3 km is about twice that of baseline case on April 16, Figure 1a , at the same altitude. The high WVMR values near the surface are due to a humid MBL. A high correlation between the σ ext and the WVMR vertical profiles on April 16, 2001 at 12UTC, Figure 1c , was also observed along the airmass transport route. A similar correlation was observed at Hefei, China by lidar on April 14, 2001 http://info.nies.go.jp:8094/AD-Net/ and east of Jeju Island by the Twin Otter aircraft on April 17, 2001 RF #11; 33°N, 128°E . We base the identification of the aerosol plume in Figures 1b and 1c as dust on the low values of the column å derived from sunphotometer measurements. Although the profiles Figures 1b and 1c were at 12UTC 21 Local Time during the night, the MPL vertical profiles show little change in the aerosol plume characteristics between the measurements at 12UTC and those of the closest measurements of the clear sky column å. The value of the å on April 13 at 09UTC is 0.15 and that at 22UTC on April 16 is 0.28. Five day back trajectory calculations of the aerosol layers observed on April 13 and 16 using the NOAA HYSLPIT model R. R. Draxler, HYSPLIT_4 user's guide, version 4.7, www.arl.noaa.gov/data/web/hysplit/index.htm also show the air masses to have originated in the dust regions of China and Mongolia, particularly the Gobi Desert and Loess Plateau regions. Other ACE-Asia studies of continental outflow from China during this time period also report observations of dust from these regions. We found a steep change in θ at the upper and lower parts of the ADL in all cases presented in this study. This change in θ across the ADL may increase the static stability of the ADL. A combined shortwave 0.3 ∼ 4.0 μm and longwave 4.0 ∼ 40 μm radiative transfer model SBDART Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer 2.0 was used to determine the radiative heating rates of the ADL with and without water vapor for cloud-free atmospheric conditions. The parameters needed for calculating the radiative heating rates are the AOD, single scattering albedo and asymmetry factor, which are all wavelength dependent. In this study, these parameters were determined with a Mie scattering code using AERONET sunphotometer retrievals in SW region see for the LW region. The aerosol properties and fluxes in the LW region were not measured on either the C-130 platform or at the Gosan site. Other important inputs such as vertical profiles of the σ ext , WVMR, T, and P were taken from the ground-based MPL, aircraft C-130 and radiosonde measurements described above. In Figure 3c the diurnally averaged LW cooling rate exceeds the SW heating rate of the ADL. This is because the LW cooling occurs throughout the day, but SW heating is only during the sunlit portion of the day. The change in the diurnally averaged heating/cooling rate with the observed WVMR appears as an increase in the heating rate in the middle of the ADL and a net cooling in the upper ADL. Compared to when we use a baseline case of the WVMR, the enhanced water vapor in the ADL causes an increase in the net radiative heating rate in the center of the ADL and a net cooling in the upper ADL. The instantaneous net cooling above the ADL was due to the low aerosol and drier conditions. As described above, the change in θ or temperature inversion at the top and bottom of the ADL may be related to the radiative heating structure of the ADL. These inversions may help to promote the stability of the ADL and prolong the transport of the ADL across the Pacific.[15]  In this study we investigated the effects of atmospheric mineral dust and water vapor on the computed atmospheric radiative heating rates. The principle findings of our analysis are as follows:[16]  1. We found that the water vapor mixing ratio within the Asian dust layer ADL was enhanced compared to the air above and below the ADL. While the source of water vapor in these elevated layers is yet to be determined, the amount of water vapor in the ADL likely depends on the surface moisture conditions in the dust outbreak region, the transport route and the magnitude of updraft stream in the cold fronts. The possible processes of water-vapor uptakes are: a The surface moisture is advected up out of the boundary layer with dust particles, and b Post-cold frontal marine boundary layer air recirculated into ascending airstreams of upstream cyclones.[17]  2. We demonstrated that the water vapor within the ADL led to a significant net heating of the ADL for the instantaneous measurements which influence the heating rate vertical structure. A steep increase in the potential temperature in the upper region of the ADL was found. This increased static stability in the ADL is due to the radiative heating of enhanced water vapor in the ADL and to the radiative cooling above the ADL from low aerosol and drier conditions. The elevated water vapor in the ADL contributes to maintaining a warmer ADL and increasing the static stability of the ADL, which may help maintaining the ADL structure for a longer period of time."
236,dust,"Comparison of MISR and AERONET aerosol optical depths over desert sites. Comparisons of the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer MISR aerosol optical depths AOD with those of the AErosol RObotic NETwork AERONET were made at four desert sites, covering a two-year time period from December 2000 to November 2002. The two data sets show good correlation with no obvious systematic biases or trends, demonstrating MISR's ability to retrieve reliable visible and near infrared AOD over surfaces with relatively high reflectance. For MISR AOD obtained at 17.6 km spatial resolution, the estimated uncertainty is about 0.08. When the spatial resolution was degraded to 52.8 km, the estimated AOD uncertainty decreased to about 0.05. Year-long time-series comparisons of MISR and AERONET AOD at the four desert sites showed that MISR can quantitatively capture the temporal nature of strong dust activity in desert regions. , impacting climate forcing. Dust can be readily observed and analyzed when over ocean but much less so when it is over land. AOD obtained by MISR over southern Africa were validated by comparing them to simultaneous ground-based results from the AErosol RObotic NETwork AERONET at a number of sites. The surface properties of these sites were spatially variegated, being a mosaic of highly vegetated to sparsely vegetated areas. In this paper MISR-retrieved AOD are compared to those from AERONET, with the site selection restricted to desert areas where the surface reflectance in the visible is relatively high and generally increases with wavelength. Typical values are about 0.25 in the green MISR 558 nm and reach about 0.4 in the near IR MISR 866 nm . This is one of the more difficult surface types over which to perform retrievals but one where aerosol property information is needed, owing to the importance of such sites as strong dust sources.. The combination of this empirical surface component with a modeled atmospheric path radiance component encompassing various aerosol types and conditions , provides hybrid multiangle radiances which are fitted to the 36 regional MISR radiances, obtained by averaging the 256 subregional radiances for each channel. Therefore, aerosol retrievals are performed only on a regional and not a subregional basis. Those atmospheric models which provide the best fitting results determine the best estimate of the aerosol properties for the region.. The number of sites selected for analysis is also small, but they include virtually all available bright desert sites that also have AERONET time coverage extending at least one year.  Table 2 lists the estimated 1 × 1 MISR AOD uncertainties per spectral band and site, when referenced to AERONET. These uncertainties are referenced to the 1:1 line thereby incorporating any bias that may be present. On average over the four desert sites, the MISR AOD uncertainty is about 0.08 1 sigma , with little dependence on spectral band. Performing the same analysis, but using the MISR 3 × 3 region AOD, resulted in uncertainty estimates which are generally smaller see Table 2 but with more site dependence. This decrease in uncertainty would be expected due to the additional number of AOD retrieval results used i.e., decrease in statistical noise and if the aerosol amount is largely constant over the 3 × 3 region area.B1 = 1 × 1 blue; G1 = 1 × 1 green; R1 = 1 × 1 red; N1 = 1 × 1 NIR B3 = 3 × 3 blue; G3 = 3 × 3 green; R3 = 3 × 3 red; N3 = 3 × 3 NIR. In the UV aerosol retrievals over deserts are facilitated by the intrinsically low surface reflectance at these wavelengths. In the visible and near IR, however, the desert terrain can be highly reflective and accurate retrievals of AOD are extremely difficult to do using single view multispectral satellite instruments because of their general inability to separate the atmospheric and surface contributions to the measured radiances. Multiangle instruments like MISR can make use of the directional properties of the surface to assist in the separation procedure. A comparison of coincident MISR and AERONET AOD at four desert sites across Africa and Asia has shown that MISR provides reliable AOD over these relatively bright surfaces. Although the MISR observation repeat time is only 3 or 4 visits per month for those latitudes where Earth's large desert areas occur, much of the major dust activity can be captured at this temporal resolution as Figure 2 demonstrates. The current estimated uncertainty in the determination of desert dust optical depth by MISR is about 0.08 when the spatial resolution is 17.6 km. If this resolution is degraded to 52.8 km, then the uncertainty approaches 0.05. The current set of MISR aerosol models used by the operational algorithm has known deficiencies, particularly with regard to dust particle properties and variety in the bimodal particle mixtures. It is expected that much of the site-specific AOD bias perceived in Figure 1 will be reduced when these aerosol models are improved. Activity in this area is currently ongoing by the MISR team and includes modification of the particle properties used by the dust models and provision of a wider variety of bimodal mixture types. Based on extensive radiometric calibration studies of MISR and continuous monitoring of the MISR operational aerosol retrieval product, the expectation is that aerosol optical depth can be consistently retrieved with an uncertainty of 0.05 at 17.6 km resolution over the Earth's land surface, including bright desert regions. Once these aerosol model improvements are implemented, more detailed validation studies can be conducted to address additional aerosol properties including particle size, sphericity, and absorption."
237,climate aerosol,"The transport pathways and sources of PM10 pollution in Beijing during spring 2001, 2002 and 2003. PM10 concentration data for Beijing were combined with trajectory clustering and potential source contribution function PSCF methods to identify the principal transport pathways and sources for high-concentration aerosol events in the spring. Three major pathways exist: the main one passes over Kazakhstan, through desert and semi-arid regions in southwestern Mongolia, and then through Inner Mongolia and onwards to Beijing. Four major potential sources were identified, these are: 1 border areas between Kazakhstan and China, 2 desert and semi-desert regions in western Mongolia, 3 the Northern High Dust Desert and 4 the Loess Plateau of China. The pathways and sources for pollution aerosol also are associated with Asian dust emissions; this suggests a significant contribution of Asian dust to PM10 pollution at Beijing.  and harming people's health. Previous work on PM 10 in Beijing has focused mainly on seasonal variations in mass concentrations and chemical composition.. Several studies on the dust sources and transport pathways to Beijing have been carried out based on the analysis of satellite images and meteorological data. . This paper describes the application of objective statistical analysis of back trajectories combined with PM 10 data for springtime from 2001 to 2003 to identify the sources and transport pathways of aerosol pollution in Beijing..PM 10 concentrations at Beijing during Spring 2001, 2002, and 2003. and the relatively few occurrences in 2003. The daily average value of PM 10 concentration for the ensemble average of the three spring seasons is 193.5 μg m −3 ; this exceeds the Class II category of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards in China for PM 10 with a limiting value of 150 μg m −3 .. Model calculations have shown that the altitudes of peak dust concentrations are typically between 1000 and 3000 m for downwind locations in China such as Beijing in Asian dust storm events, and these results have been verified by lidar observations. On this basis, an arrival height of 1100 m a.g.l. ∼850 hPa was chosen for target trajectory analysis. For statistical analysis of the data, PM 10 concentrations at Beijing were assigned to corresponding trajectories. The PSCF value for a single grid cell is calculated by counting each trajectory segment endpoint that terminates within that grid cell. The number of endpoints that fall in the. The dust storm sources inferred from the analysis of satellite images and meteorological data for several dust events are consistent with the four source regions identified in this study. Therefore the regions with high PSCF values are not only sources for PM 10 , but also sources of dust during the spring. On the other hand, low PSCF values indicate that the Western High Dust Desert with the Taklimakan Desert as its center, and the northeastern sandy lands including Onqin Daga and Hoqin sandy land, are not the main sources for Beijing PM 10 during the three springs that were evaluated.PSCF map for Beijing PM 10 in spring 2001 to 2003.[16]  The particles from the source region I were mainly associated with the transport path represented by Cluster B. The trajectories for Clusters A and B both passed over source region II. The pathway of Cluster A also passed over the source regions III and IV. Although there were 72 polluted trajectories in Cluster C, the mean PM 10 concentration for this cluster was not especially high because of the relatively large percentage of non-polluted trajectories compared with Clusters A and B. The PSCF map indicated there was no single source region associated with the pathway of Cluster C. Nevertheless, air masses categorized in Cluster C also passed over deserts and desert margins from which considerable quantities of dust can be emitted.[17]  Three dominant pathways and four major potential sources of Beijing PM 10 pollution in spring were identified by trajectory cluster analysis and a PSCF-based method. The trajectory statistical methods effectively identify the pathways and sources for PM 10 pollution and dust at a given site. Although these methods are often described as objective methods, in some steps, such as determining number of cluster and choosing a PSCF criterion, researchers must make subjective decisions.[18]  Of the three major pathways for PM 10 pollution, Cluster B, which is mainly from Kazakhstan, passing through desert and semi-desert regions in southwestern Mongolia, and then through central Inner Mongolia to Beijing, is the most important one contributing to Beijing PM 10 pollution in the spring. Four major potential sources of Beijing PM 10 pollution in spring are the 1 border areas between Kazakhstan and China, 2 desert and semi-desert regions in western Mongolia, 3 the Northern High Dust Desert and 4 the Loess Plateau of China. Several of areas identified also are important sources for dust; and this demonstrates a strong connection between the sources for Asian dust and PM 10 pollution in Beijing during the springtime."
238,dust ocean,"Monitoring aerosol optical properties over the Mediterranean from SeaWiFS images using a neural network inversion. The SeaWiFS archive provides a unique opportunity to study aerosol optical properties over oceans since October 1997. Standard SeaWiFS aerosol products are however not suitable because optical thicknesses are limited to 0.35 and Angstrom exponents to 1.5. We developed an inversion based on neural networks to retrieve both optical thickness and Angstrom exponent from SeaWiFS red and near infrared channels. Neural networks are capable of approximating non-linear inverse functions and of processing efficiently large amounts of data. Neural networks were trained with radiative transfer computations for wide ranges of optical thickness and Angstrom exponent. All SeaWiFS images of the Mediterranean for year 2000 were processed and monthly mean maps of aerosol optical thickness and Angstrom exponent were derived. A comparison with ground-based measurements at three AERONET stations in the Mediterranean shows the good accuracy of the method, as well as the improvement compared to operational SeaWiFS aerosol products. , and long time-series of images from Meteosat and TOMS have recently been used to study both seasonal and inter-annual variability of mineral dust transport over the last 20 years. These meteorological sensors were however not designed for aerosol studies and they do not allow to determine important aerosol optical properties such as the Angström exponent, which characterizes the aerosol size distribution., including the Angström exponent. The SeaWiFS ocean color sensor provides multispectral measurements in the visible and near infrared NIR spectrum since October 1997. SeaWiFS aerosol products i.e., aerosol optical thickness and Angström exponent are generated, validated and made available by NASA. These aerosol products remain however a by-product of the atmospheric correction algorithm and are hardly usable for global aerosol studies mainly because aerosol optical thicknesses higher than about 0.35 are rejected to ensure the quality of the marine parameters, preventing from observing dense aerosol plumes.. This algorithm is time-consuming because it relies on a comparison of SeaWiFS measurements in the NIR i.e., 765 and 865 nm to theoretical values computed for several types of aerosols. Another important limitation of this method for aerosol studies is that retrieved Angström exponent values are confined between 0 and 1.5 by construction, whereas its actual range is rather between 0 and 2, as shown by sun-photometer measurements in coastal areas. This suggests that SeaWiFS aerosol products do not provide relevant information where small aerosols i.e, characterized by large Angström exponent , dominate. We present here the results of a new method that is fast and accurate enough to reprocess large sets of SeaWiFS images for aerosol studies.. Here we use a particular class of NN, the so-called Multi-Layered Perceptron, MLP, to retrieve independently the aerosol optical thickness at 865 nm, τ 865 , and the Angström exponent between 510 and 865 nm, α 510 , from SeaWiFS measurements in the red 670 nm and near infrared 765 and 865 nm bands. The Angström exponent between 510 and 865 nm was chosen for compatibility with standard SeaWiFS products. An MLP is a set of interconnected neurons, which are organized in layers and which communicate only with the neurons to which it is connected. Characteristics of each neuron i.e., the weights associated to each connection are computed during the training phase.. A training database of 100,000 ρ A λ was randomly extracted out of these 360,000 simulations to optimize the architecture of the two MLP used here: The MLP for α 510 retrieval has two hidden layers with 10 neurons on the first and 6 on the second layer, while the one for τ 865 retrieval has 30 neurons on the first hidden layer and 15 on the second.. The cloud rejection test was also modified to avoid high aerosol optical thickness removal. This processing code was used to mask the sun glint, correct ozone and water vapor absorptions, and subtract the whitecaps and Rayleigh scattering contributions, forming ρ A λ . The complete geometry θ S , θ V and Δϕ and ρ A λ for each band are then entered into both MLP to get τ 865 and α 510 .. This influence is stronger in the southern part of the basin, where τ 865 reaches values as high as 0.35 in monthly mean near the Algerian and Libyan coasts. The Angström exponent of mineral dust is low and generally between 0.5 and 0.8. A strong North-South gradient is shown in Figure 1 on both τ 865 and α 510 maps during spring and summer. In contrast with the southern basin, which is influenced by mineral dust transport, the northern Mediterranean is characterized by relatively low τ 865 and high α 510 between 1 and 1.5. This suggests that aerosols in this region originate primarily from polluted regions of Europe. The optical thickness is much lower over the whole Mediterranean during fall and winter, even if some transports of mineral dust occur in the central basin and along the Syrian coast during October. The aerosols during this period are mostly of European origin as seen by the high monthly mean α 510 values of 1 to 1.5.Monthly mean values of τ 865 left panels and α 510 right panels for January, April, July and October 2000. were used to validate our neural network inversion. Hourly level 2.0 cloud-screened and quality-assured sun photometer measurements at three Mediterranean stations Lampedusa, 35°31′N–12°37′E; Oristano, 39°54′N–08°30′E; Erdemli, 36°33′N–34°15′E stations were available for 2000. A fourth station, El Arenosillo 37°06′N, 6°43′W , was rejected because the instrument experienced calibration problems in the NIR V. Cachorro, personal communication, 2003 . Because sun photometers do not have a channel at 510 nm, τ 510 , which is used to compute α 510 , was linearly interpolated between τ 440 and τ 670 to ensure compatibility with both SeaWiFS estimates. A few apparent outliers still remain in the level 2.0 data and we decided to further remove measurements when α 510 is below zero or when τ 865 is below 0.05. The comparison of sun photometer measurements with satellite retrievals was made by extracting τ 865 and α 510 computed from both the standard and the MLP algorithms over the closest 3-by-3 pixel marine area distant of at least 5 km from the coast to avoid any turbid water contamination. We ended up with a set of 212 coincident measurements for MLP retrievals and only 157 for standard retrievals because of the more strict cloud mask. but it impacts AERONET measurements at 443 nm and thus modifies the Angström exponent. Figure 3 also demonstrates the importance of considering aerosol models which cover a wide range of Angström exponent between 0 and 2, at least over oceanic region with significant continental influence, such as the Mediterranean. These comparisons between AERONET and SeaWiFS aerosol parameters show the benefit of our inversion technique based on neural networks.Comparison of τ 865 retrieved from MLP ▴ and standard ○ inversion methods with τ 865 measured at the three considered AERONET stations see text . The regression line for our MLP inversion solid line has a slope of 1.12 and the correlation coefficient is 0.90 for 212 coincident measurements. The slope is unchanged and the correlation coefficient drops down to 0.82 if measurements with τ 865 > 0.35 are excluded for compatibility with standard SeaWiFS products. For these latter products dashed line , the slope is 1.04 and the correlation coefficient is 0.67 for 157 coincident measurements.Comparison of α 510 retrieved from MLP ▴ and standard ○ inversion methods with α 510 measured at the three considered AERONET stations see text . The regression line for our MLP inversion solid line has a slope of 0.82 and the correlation coefficient is 0.68 for 212 coincident measurements. For the standard SeaWiFS product dashed line , the slope is 0.5 and the correlation coefficient is 0.62 for 157 coincident measurements.[11]  A new inversion technique based on Multi-Layered Perceptrons has been developed to retrieve aerosol optical thickness, τ 865 , and Angström exponent, α 510 , from SeaWiFS imagery. Two neural networks, one for each parameter, have been built and calibrated using a set of theoretical radiative transfer simulations performed using various aerosol optical properties. In order to account for a realistic range of α 510 between 0.2 and 2.2, we used a set of six Junge's power-law size distributions. SeaWiFS data were processed for year 2000 over the Mediterranean and the results were validated using AERONET measurements. This comparison shows that α 510 and τ 865 from the MLP inversion are retrieved with a good accuracy, even for high optical thicknesses up to 0.8, and are less biased than those from the standard processing. The method presented here is thus accurate and fast enough to process the whole SeaWiFS archive in order to facilitate the long-term monitoring of aerosol optical properties."
239,aerosol,"Optical properties of Saharan dust layers as detected by a Raman lidar at Thessaloniki, Greece. Measurements during Saharan dust transport events were performed at several stations of the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network. During the period 2001 - 2002, 12 cases were captured at Thessaloniki, Greece 40.5 degrees N, 22.9 degrees E with a 355 nm Raman lidar. For these cases the vertical profiles of the extinction and backscatter coefficients were determined and examined, as well as profiles of extinction-to-backscatter ratio lidar ratio and the backscatter-related Angstrom exponent between 355 and 532 nm color index . Model calculations from the DREAM model confirmed the existence of Saharan dust in all cases examined. Within the dust plumes the lidar ratios ranged from 20 to 100 sr and the color index ranged from - 1 to 3. An anticorrelation was found between the lidar ratio and the color index during the Saharan dust events. In certain cases the results suggest that the mixing of dust particles with boundary layer aerosols reduces the dust 'signature' and thus, makes difficult the separation of the dust particles from those of mostly urban origin. , they influence tropospheric photochemistry, they modify cloud properties and thus they are considered as a significant climate-forcing factor. One of the major natural sources of tropospheric aerosols are the deserts. A large amount of mineral dust is injected under favourable weather conditions into the free troposphere, where medium and long-range transport takes place. The co-existence of such lofted dust plumes over areas with significant amounts of aerosols of anthropogenic origin in the boundary layer, does not allow their accurate separation, when examining satellite or ground-based aerosol columnar measurements. as well as the Asian dust network provided coordinated measurements during outbreaks of desert dust.  At Thessaloniki a 355 nm Raman lidar is used to perform measurements of tropospheric aerosols. The transmitted laser beam overlaps completely with the receiver's field of view, usually at heights around 1000 m for 355 nm and 700 m for 532 nm. At a system level our lidar was successfully intercompared with the other EARLINET groups showing on the average an agreement of better than 5% for heights above 2 km. Raman lidar measurements were limited to night-time. We used the Klett . From the particle backscatter coefficient profiles at the two wavelengths we determined the backscatter related Angstrom exponent profile color index . In the retrieval we used at both wavelengths the measured lidar ratio at 355 nm. An uncertainty of 10 sr in the retrieval of the backscatter coefficient at 532 nm can introduce a difference of 0.25 in the color index under moderate aerosol loading. was used for the accurate description of the dust load in the atmosphere. The dust modules of the entire system incorporate state of the art parameterizations of all the major phases of the atmospheric dust life, such as production, diffusion, advection, and removal. These modules also include effects of the particle size distribution on aerosol dispersion. The lidar ratio is an indicator of the aerosol type e.g., maritime, continental etc , while the color index is strongly dependent on particle size and shape. The criterion for considering the cases presented as Sahara events, was the back-trajectory analysis. Study of the back trajectories provided by the German Weather Service DWD indicates that air masses ending over our station for the 12 days of interest had their origin in Sahara. These outbreaks were also simulated with the DREAM model, in order to verify the presence of Saharan dust, indicated from the trajectory analysis. The model estimates for the dust load over the Mediterranean are presented in Figure 2 . For three of the twelve cases there were no simulations available. The model simulations, confirm the presence of Saharan dust in the free-troposphere over Thessaloniki. None of the cases presented were accompanied by precipitation or severe cloud conditions.Dust load over South Europe on selected days when Saharan dust aerosol was present in the free-troposphere of Thessaloniki, Greece, estimated with the DREAM model., the lidar ratio of our observations has a larger variability.. We suggest that in Figure 3 we can distinguish between three “regions” relative to the size of the particles.Vertical mean values of lidar ratio versus color index for selected height ranges of Saharan dust layers, measured on 12 days when Saharan dust aerosol was present in the free-troposphere of Thessaloniki, Greece.. The mean lidar ratio found equal to 83.75 ± 19.8. This result is consistent with measurements found in other studies, where larger than the modelled lidar ratios were calculated in the detected Saharan dust plumes. The large lidar ratios can be explained by the deviations between the scattering characteristics of spheres and spheroids as well as due to absorption by the dust particles. Model calculations assume spherical particles, while the non-spherical shape of the desert particles can lead to a strong reduction of the backscattering efficiency compared with backscattering by surface-equivalent spheres. mention that the non-spherical shape of the particles, becomes less important as the result of smaller mean particle size. This is consistent with our measurements of lidar ratio and color index. The larger color index, relative the one expected for typical desert dust, could also indicates the mixing of desert aerosols with anthropogenic aerosol.. The profiles that correspond to region 3 show an exponential vertical distribution of the aerosols, which provides evidence that the desert dust layers have been well mixed, with probably maritime aerosols from layers below or aerosols related to pollution, or even have been completely removed. This is partly confirmed, when looking at the trajectories that correspond to region 3. They indicate the uplifting of air-masses takes place above the sea, which results to mixing of desert dust with maritime and pollution aerosols. It is well established that the eastern-Mediterranean is a crossroad of different pollution sources.[14]  The south-eastern Mediterranean is a crossroad where aerosol can be transported from very different sources. The frequent co-existence of urban, continental, dust and marine aerosol over Thessaloniki makes difficult to provide distinct information on the optical properties of the individual types of aerosols using lidar measurements.[15]  Within the dust plumes, indicated by the DREAM model and the lidar measurements, the lidar ratio and the color index showed a wide range of values from 20 to 100 sr and from −1 to 3 respectively, which was not expected by other studies and theoretical calculations based on known microphysical properties of desert dust. A significant anticorrelation was found between the lidar ratio and the color index during the Saharan dust events. The large lidar ratios of 80 sr correspond to the larger and also absorbing dust particles and are consistent with calculations that consider non-spherical particles. Lidar ratios between 45 and 55 sr were found in most of the cases, which are consistent with many earlier experimental and theoretical studies.[16]  In few cases mixing with boundary layer urban and maritime aerosols makes the separation or even detection of dust in the lidar measurements difficult, since the estimated lidar ratio values close to 20 sr and color index values greater than 1.5 are not representative for desert dust. The explanation of these values would require calculations of the optical properties of the aerosols based on more realistic mixtures of particles."
240,climate,"Diurnal variability of dust aerosol optical thickness and Angstrom exponent over dust source regions in China. [1] Using 22 months of Sunphotometer Aerosol Optical Thickness AOT data collected near the Taklamakan and Gobi dust source regions Dunhuang, 40.09degreesN, 94.41degreesE in China; we examine the diurnal and seasonal change of dust aerosol properties. Most dust events are during the spring through early summer months with a season-invariant diurnal change of more than +/-10% for AOTand +/-30% for Angstrom exponent, with larger AOT and smaller Angstrom exponent values late in the afternoon. These values are much larger when compared to recent studies that have reported a much smaller +/-5% diurnal variability of dust AOT over various AERONET sites where dust is a major contributor to AOT. The differences are largely due to the geographical locations and meteorological conditions and such large diurnal changes of aerosol properties at or near dust source regions may be significant enough for consideration in regional radiative forcing, air quality and numerical modeling studies. . Current understanding of the radiative forcing of dust aerosols is limited, especially over dust source regions where ground observations are sparse and polar orbiting, multi-spectral satellite retrievals at visible to near-infrared wavelengths are often difficult due to the high surface albedo. While several studies and field experiments were conducted to study Saharan dust aerosols, the widely prevalent dust events “yellow sand” from the Taklamakan and Gobi deserts in Northwest China, have only gained attention recently. In addition, recent experiments such as ACE-Asia examined aerosol properties thousands of kilometers downwind from the Taklamakan and Gobi deserts. To our knowledge, no long-term systematic observations of dust radiative properties at or near dust source regions over China have been presented., recent studies have indicated that the diurnal variability of dust AOT is small <±5% over various observation sites such as Cape Verde that is several hundred kilometers downwind from the Saharan dust source region. On the other hand, several cases studies from both ground observations and geostationary satellite retrievals reported that the diurnal variation of dust aerosols could be relatively larger >15% and are important for dust radiative forcing calculations. Our current study is different from previous research since we use Sunphotometer-derived aerosol optical thickness SP AOT collected near the Chinese dust source regions over a two-year time period to analyze the diurnal and seasonal variations of dust properties.. This zone is bounded by several mountains with elevations higher than 3000 m and usually, the lofted dust aerosols in this zone are transported eastward, affecting the eastern part of China and other countries such as Japan and Korea. At other times, cold high-pressure systems from Siberia could entrain the dust aerosols westward, to an elevation greater than 5000 m, and then further northward to 50°N, where ultimately dust would be transported by the westerly jet stream to the North Pacific Ocean. In either case, Dunhuang is affected by these dust storms. The elevation of Dunhuang city is about 1400 m above sea level, the annual relative humidity is about 40%, and annual precipitation is less than 16 mm. Such geographical and meteorological characteristics of the Dunhuang observation site are different when compared with Cape Verde 16.72°N, 22.93°W that is commonly used to study Saharan dust properties.Map of the observation site Duhuang denoted as filled circle and its vicinity. The inset shows the map of eastern Asia. The shaded area in the inset is the location of Taklamakan desert and Gobi desert based on the on the ecosystem database from USGS .

The random errors in calibration during each time step were filtered by using techniques outlined by . Therefore long-term systematic observation of aerosol optical properties both during day and night coupled with meteorological observations is necessary.Diurnal variations expressed in terms of percentage departure from daily mean for aerosol optical depth and Angström exponent at several sites where dust is a major contributor.. To apply satellite-based estimation of AOT to calculate the mean radiative forcing of dust aerosols, the diurnal change of dust AOT and other radiative properties should be carefully considered, especially in the dust source regions. The larger diurnal variations of dust AOT could also pose challenges for forecast of air quality and visibility where high temporal resolution products are needed, especially for aviation and military purposes. From this perspective, the current and future generation of geostationary satellites could play an important role in capturing the large diurnal variations of aerosol properties over a large spatial domain."
241,aerosol,"Sensitivity of Asian dust storm to natural and anthropogenic factors. [1] The impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on sand and dust storm distribution of 2001 in East Asia have been investigated by using the most up-to-date desertification map in China and desert reversal scenarios in natural precipitation zones. Here we show that although desertification in China has only increased total area of desert by similar to2%-7% since 1950s [Zhong, 1999; Zhu and Zhu, 1999], it has generated disproportionably large areas with dust storm production potentials. Depending on the degree of desertification, newly formed deserts covered 15% to 19% of the original desert areas and would generate more dust storm, ranging from 10% to 40%, under the same meteorological conditions for spring 2001. Among the natural factors, the restoration of vegetation covers in the Chinese deserts within the 200 mm/y and 400 mm/y precipitation zones was found to decrease the surface mass concentrations by 10-50% in most regions. It is also found that the contributions of surface concentrations from non-Chinese deserts account for up to 60% in Northeast China and up to 50% in Korea and Japan.  in East Asia and consequently the depositions of the soil dust form the loess plateau in Northwest China. During the last 2.6 ma, nature regulated the desert areas through the precipitation patterns and limited the expansion of natural deserts. However in the last one hundred years, industrialization and population expansion have created another potential source for dust due to the deterioration of eco systems on the periphery of natural deserts and led to anthropogenic deserts. Areas with vegetation cover previously sustained by natural precipitation are becoming deserted and resulted in an increase of the desert area by ∼2 to ∼7% in China over last 43 years with an expansion rate of 310 km 2 /a. A recently published Chinese desertification map has put more areas under the desertification category with an attentive increase in soil dust production potential. The increase in soil dust production from Asia will certainly increase the dust loading of the tropospheric aerosol in mid-latitude regions and contribute further to uncertainties in global dust emission and the assessment of its climate impact.. This explains the generally declining trends of dust emission and soil dust storm frequencies observed in China. However, the question still remains as to how much the anthropogenic deserts contribute to the dust storm under the same meteorological or climatic conditions. The new desertification map in China can be used quantitatively to simulate the anthropogenic desert contributions to the dust storms and formulate more scientifically-based desert control strategies. Here we present a modeling study to address: i how much the soil dust production areas have been changed due to desertification processes, how they influence the dust frequency of East Asia, ii how much reduction in dust storms will be achieved if the anthropogenic deserts are restored to natural desert in proper precipitation zones and iii how much the soil dust contributions to East Asia are from non-Chinese deserts.. Twelve diameter classes from 0.01 to 41 μm were used to represent soil dust aerosols in the atmosphere. Dust fluxes and concentrations were calculated for each size bin. The input parameters to drive the dust source function have been developed for this region during previous studies. To accurately simulate the dust emission and transport, the model was fully nudged to NCEP re-analysis meteorology for spring 2001. The model was run on a polar stereographic projection covering East Asia with a horizontal resolution of 45 × 45 km at 60°N and 22 vertical levels on a Gal-Chen terrain following coordinate from ground to 30 km and 15 minutes integration time.. Other deserts represent the original deserts in 1950's while Progressing and Potential deserts are the main desertification areas since 1950's. The desertification occurred mainly at the rim of the Onqin Daga sandy land, the southwestern and northwestern fringes of the Horqin sandy land, the central and northern parts of Mu Us Desert; and to some degree in the desert in Qaidam Basin, the Kumutage Desert, and in the eastern part of Badain Jaran Desert. There were minor expansions at the margins of Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut Desert. Strictly speaking, these desertification areas cannot yet be defined as deserts. Comparing with the desert distributions of 1950's, these areas are becoming barren sandy lands with sparse vegetation. They are, however, high potential sources of soil dust emission as recent satellite data showed a large amount of dust storms in the progressing and potential desertification areas in Northeast China. According to the survey, the desertification has increased the barren sandy lands by 144,000 km 2 and 175000 km 2 as the Progressing and Potential desertification areas in China, respectively, accounting for about 15% and 19% of the current desert areas of 930000 km 2 it includes about 850000 km 2 deserts in 1950's and 80000 km 2 new deserts since then . The cause of this rapid desertification is rather complex and it could be anthropogenic or/and natural. Three annual precipitation isopleths are superimposed on Figure 1 for 200, 300 and 400 mm, respectively. It is shown that the desert distributions correspond mostly to low precipitation regions.New Chinese Desertification Map with three precipitation lines indicating annual rate of 200 mm, 300 mm and 400 mm. Potential and Progressing Deserts are defined in the text. The Other Desert indicates the approximate desert distributions in 1950's.  Figure 2 shows the impact of desertification on the distributions of surface dust concentrations in East Asia by Potential and combined Potential and Progressing Deserts. It is apparent that the influences are felt mostly downwind of the desertification areas. The maximum impact by the Potential Desert is about 50% over desertification regions. However, the 10% contour line includes most of the Northeast China, Korea and Japan. Due to a convergence flow over Japan, the impact reaches 20%. The relative difference to the benchmark simulation when both Potential and Progressing Deserts are removed is much larger and reaches as high as 90% Table 1 . The 10% contour covers a much larger area than that without the Potential desert only, which extends from the Mu Us desert down south over central China and from Onqin Daga and Horqin sandy lands down over east coast regions of China. The impact even reaches northern Mongolia by a cyclone activity which transports soil dust from China in 2001.Percentage reductions of dust surface concentrations by removing Potential Desert contour lines and by removing both Potential and Progressing deserts filled contours in Figure 1 . has indicated that the reversal of desertification in these areas is occurring by a combination of human endeavours and natural processes.Percentage reductions of dust surface concentrations by removing deserts within 400 mm/a precipitation line contour lines and by removing deserts 200 mm/a precipitation line filled contours in Figure 1 . The desertification processes in China have produced large soil dust producing areas even though they cannot be strictly defined as deserts. They generate 10% to 40% more dust storms than in the 1950's under the same meteorological conditions. These so-called anthropogenic dust storm areas are reversible through natural precipitations and human controls. Since these areas are closer than the original deserts to human habitats, the reversal of them is even more significant to human activities. Precipitation is the major variable to control the desertification processes. Reversal of the soil dust production areas to grassland and oasis in the areas annually receiving 200 mm to 400 mm precipitations could reduce the soil dust storm in East Asia from 10% to 50%. Non-Chinese deserts contribute up to 60% surface dust concentrations in Northeast China and up to 50% in Korea and Japan. Thus, effective remediation of dust forming areas requires regional cooperation.[12]  Modelling tools used in the characterization of the current anthropogenic contributions of soil dust to the Asia-Pacific regions in this study can also be applied to reduce the uncertainties in radiation forcing by soil dust. It should be pointed out the results shown in this study were obtained from 2001 meteorology. However, the conclusions about the general trends should apply to other years since they were focused on the relative impact of desertification and precipitation not the absolute values of the dust storms, even considering the non-linear impact of desertification and precipitations on dust concentrations."
242,aerosol,"Direct wind measurements of Saharan dust events from Terra and Aqua satellites. Wind speed and direction, during Saharan dust episodes are calculated by estimating the movement of the dust plume between the morning observations from Terra and the afternoon observations from Aqua by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS . The difference in the position of the dust front easily identified both near the dust sources and over the ocean between the Terra and Aqua observations is used to derive the actual wind field of the dust layer. The analysis is used to estimate the near-surface wind properties needed for dust mobilization in the Bodele depression. Comparison with NCEP reanalysis winds shows that NCEP underestimated by factor 2 the actual speed of the dust front progression near the sources and produced an azimuthal spread, three times wider than the measured one. Over the seashore, with more numerous meteorological observations, the NCEP wind field did match very well the dust measurements. . Global scale models, evaluated by satellite and ground based observations, have been used to simulate dust emission, transport and deposition... Often the dust events result from collection of many small-scale dust plumes emerging from separated point sources within an area of a few square kilometers. . The direct sources of alluvium material are the Tibesty Mountains north, and the Ennedi Mountains east of the Bodele. These mountains form a large Caldera-like shape, with its northeast boundary being Egypt's west border. The opening in the Caldera channels the surface winds directly towards the Bodele. Evidence of such wind channeling is observed from satellite images by visually following the wind channels on the surface, from south of the Nile delta in Egypt, through the Tibesty-Ennedi passage and then over the Bodele toward the Sahel in the southwest. In this study we analyze all the dust storms observed during January–April 2003 over the Bodele and calculate the wind speed and direction of the dust movement for each event. The dust progression is derived from the average displacement of the dust front between the morning-pass of Terra and the three hours later afternoon-pass of Aqua. MODIS daily observations with the visible channels are used in the analysis. Terra in a descending orbit passes over the Sahara in approximately at 10:30 am GMT and Aqua in an ascending orbit passes over the same area approximately at 1:30 pm GMT. Note that the wind field may change between the Terra and Aqua observations. Ginoux and Torres  We define the front point see Figure 2 as the location where the optical depth is half of the average value in the bulk part of the plume. Over the ocean the gradient is already not as sharp. The line that connects the front points in the leading edge of the plume defines the front line. The displacement of the dust front between the Terra and Aqua observations is defined as the average difference in the location of the front line, along the direction of propagation. Such definition of the front line allows calculation of the displacement of the dust event between Terra and Aqua, independently of the magnitude of the dust optical depth.Contour plot of the line of maximum gradient in the blue reflectance. The red line is of the dust plume in the Terra image and the blue line is of Aqua. The propagation of the plume can be estimated by the average distance of the front lines. To calculate the average displacement and direction azimuth of the dust front we transformed the satellite images from a Cartesian coordinate set to a polar set where the origin is located at the center of the dust source over land or in the beginning of the plume over the ocean. The lower images in Figure 1 Figures 1c and 1d are the transformed images in the blue channel of Figures 1a and 1b , respectively. The y axis is the azimuth in degrees and the x axis is the distance from the origin marked as red dot in Figures 1a and 1b , directly proportional to the wind speed in the dust layer. Furthermore, we can measure the uncertainty in the azimuth of the wind vector as the width of the dust plume along the y scale and the uncertainty in front location as the width of the front x scale . We analyzed 15 dust events, all but two events emitted from the Bodele Depression during the winter and spring of 2003. The omitted two events were not covered by Terra or Aqua. The average wind speed is 13 m/s with standard deviation of 1 m/s, in accord with average uncertainty per single measurement of 1.2 m/s. The average direction is 248° ± 8°.. Such reanalysis databases are the input for dust models for activation of sources and dust transport. The near surface winds 925 mb were consistently closer in azimuth and in speed to the measured winds though significantly weaker. The mean 925 mb wind speed is 7.2 ± 2.5 m/s, 50% weaker than measured, and the average azimuth is 238° ± 24°, close to the measured azimuth of 248° but with a large standard deviation. In Figure 4 , the measured winds blue and the reanalysis winds in three pressure levels 1000, 925, 850 are plotted in polar coordinates.Direct wind measurements over the Bodele depression blue , and the model reanalysis results at the surface red , 925 mb black , and 850 mb green . The dashed circles are wind speed lines of 0m/s in the origin 5, 10, 15 and 20 m/s and the numbers on the outer circle are the wind direction in degrees from the north see illustrations .. The last case, over the Mediterranean, we found almost perfect matches 5% difference in both speed and direction between the 950 mb winds and the measurement.Direct wind measurements in locations where the reanalysis model is expected to have a better agreement with measurements. The stars represent the wind measurements derived from the displacement of the dust fronts and the circles represent the model winds direction and speed in 7 pressure levels 1000 mb to 400 mb. The best agreement is defined by both direction and speed the orange arrow links the best fit to the measurement ..[20]  Near the sources in the Sahara, NCEP wind reanalysis underestimates the actual dust wind speed by factor of 2. Much better fit, within 8–30%, was found near the African seashore, a region better populated with meteorological observatories. The reanalysis winds at the source are used as input for models of dust activation and transport. It is possible that the complex dependence of the dust activation models on the surface winds results from an attempt to correct some of these systematic biases in the reanalysis wind field."
243,dust aerosol ocean,"Remote sensing of new production fuelled by nitrogen fixation. Climatological satellite observations in the tropical North Atlantic generally show a wintertime surface chlorophyll-a Chl-a maximum except over a broad region in the western North Atlantic that has a summer Chl-a maximum. This region also shows decoupling between Chl-a and vertical nutrient flux, based on the positive relationship between sea surface height anomaly SSH , sea surface temperature, and Chl-a. An analogous summer Chl-a maximum is simulated in a model including a dynamic representation of Trichodesmium and N-2-fixation, but not in runs without. These results suggest that the growth is fuelled by N-2-fixation. Using the observed summertime increase in Chl-a and the model efficiency for N-2-fixation transfer to phytoplankton biomass, we calculate a nitrogen fixation rate of 220 mumol N m -2 day -1 in this region. This constitutes the first satellite observation of the effect of nitrogen fixation on Chl-a, and may ultimately provide a means of deriving new global N-2-fixation estimates.  of atmospheric nitrogen to the ocean, which may be comparable locally to the vertical flux of nitrate. Unlike the vertical nitrate flux, N 2 -fixation is independent of dissolved carbon fluxes from the deep ocean and so can potentially drive a net uptake of CO 2 and export of carbon. However, global rate estimates are hindered by few available observations, and efforts to detect Nitrogen fixation by Nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium spp.: An important source of new nitrogen to the tropical North Atlantic Ocean, Science , submitted, using their Figure 18 and N:P stoichiometries of 125:1 and 50:1.Calculated based on change in Chl-a Figure 3a , see text .Direct calculation of model rate. The approach that we have used here—of combining multiple satellite data sets with or without model simulations—may provide a means for estimating patterns of nitrogen fixation, as well as its impact on phytoplankton biomass and ultimately carbon sequestration, on global scales. This work provides a new observational basis for evaluating the global significance of nitrogen fixation to new production and the carbon cycle. If diazotrophs have the potential to shift the ocean from nitrogen to phosphorus limitation and alter global climate through changes in the biological pump, then improving our understanding of their spatial and temporal patterns and production is essential."
244,particles,"Aerosol partitioning in natural mixed-phase clouds. In situ aerosol and cloud drop microphysical measurements at a high-alpine site are used to investigate aerosol partitioning between cloud and interstitial phases in natural, mid-latitude, mixed-phase clouds. Measurements indicate a decrease in the activated aerosol fraction F-N for particle diameters d P > 100 nm with cloud temperature from F-N similar to 0.54 in summer liquid-phase clouds to F-N similar to 0.08 in winter mixed-phase clouds. The latter may be attributed to the Bergeron-Findeisen mechanism whereby ice crystals grow at the expense of liquid water drops, releasing formerly activated aerosols back into the interstitial phase. This provides a means to distinguish the indirect effects of aerosols on drops and ice crystals. . Our current understanding of warm cloud microphysics and their effect on climate change is still rather incomplete, and is even more so for mixed-phase/glaciated clouds. If ice crystals form inside a cloud, they can grow by water vapor deposition or by riming onto ice crystals. An important process in mixed-phase clouds is the Bergeron-Findeisen B-F mechanism, whereby ice crystals grow by transfer of water vapor from supercooled drops if the environment is super-saturated with respect to ice S Ice > 0 but sub-saturated with respect to liquid water S Liq < 0 . Cloud drops form by heterogeneous nucleation on cloud condensation nuclei CCN , a subset of the aerosol population. Ice crystals on the other hand form on ice nuclei IN , an even smaller subset, which are not necessarily CCN. The relative scarcity of IN compared with CCN suggests that the B-F mechanism converts many small supercooled drops to only few, large ice crystals, thus enhancing precipitation. Although the B-F mechanism is considered responsible for precipitation in cold mid-latitude clouds, estimates of the indirect effects of aerosols on climate are only beginning to treat the dependence of the B-F mechanism on aerosols. Few microphysical studies have considered aerosol partitioning into interstitial aerosols, CCN and IN, or the release of aerosols back into the interstitial phase as a consequence of evaporation from supercooled drops. Hence, improved knowledge of this mechanism in natural clouds is required. To better understand the role of aerosol partitioning in clouds, measurements are presented from two campaigns summer and winter 2000 at the high-alpine research station Jungfraujoch JFJ, 3580 m asl, 46°33′N, 7°59′E, Switzerland .. Ambient air was sampled from two different inlet systems: A total inlet for aerosols and liquid drops/ice crystals, and an interstitial inlet for aerosols only. Aerosol size distributions diameter d P = 18–800 nm; 6-minute resolution were measured using an SMPS scanning mobility particle sizer; TSI 3934; TSI Inc. system, and the cloud drop distribution with a forward scattering spectrometer probe FSSP-100; PMS Inc.; either d D = 4.5–30 μm or 6.3–62 μm . Due to the difference in laboratory T ∼ 25°C and ambient T < −3°C temperatures, size distributions refer to their dry size at a relative humidity <10%. Both SMPS and FSSP were calibrated particle number and size and FSSP data corrected for counting losses. The internal consistency of measurements was checked by comparing logarithmized values of the difference between total N Tot and interstitial N Int aerosol number against the cloud particle number N D . A correlation R 2 = 0.78 slope m = 0.70 for summer data was reasonable, however, winter data at R 2 = 0.29 slope m = 0.61 were low. As no systematic bias is found, the poor correlation in winter is attributed to the poorer counting statistics. Cloud events were measured with a CWC monitor cloud water content; PVM-100; Gerber Sci. which measures the light scattered by a hydrometeor population exposed to a laser beam and relates it to the CWC. Even though the instrument is designed to measure only the liquid water content, the instrument showed also some sensitivity to ice crystals see below . Clouds were judged to occur when CWC > 0.02 g m −3 for at least 85% of the 15-minute interval. Weather conditions during both campaigns allowed 136 and 408 hours of in-cloud observations to be collected in summer and winter, respectively., which is a ventilated, heated thermometer, combined with a dew point hygrometer, with an accuracy of ±0.15 K in the observed temperature range, e.g., this leads to an uncertainty of about 1% in the calculated saturation values at a temperature of −3°C. It has to be kept in mind that cloud properties may vary very rapidly which is not reflected in the measurements, and hence the saturation data represent average values over a minimum time period of 15 min. suggesting aged air masses, as supported by 5-day back-trajectory analyses, which arrived from over the north Atlantic.Total and interstitial aerosol left panel and cloud drop right panel number size distributions for average T °C : a −3.2 ±2.5 max/min , b −7.7 ±0.7 , and c −17.9 ±2.2 . Uncertainty bars indicate ±1 std measurement variability. A step function would be expected for a chemically pure aerosol; however, due to variations in the supersaturation and chemical composition a sigmoidal curve is generally observed. A common parameter in assessing size-dependent activation is the 50% aerosol activation diameter d 50 when f N d P = 0.5. Case 1 indicates complete activation for particles d P > 400 nm with a 50% activation diameter d 50 ∼ 100 nm. Case 2 is similar except that d 50 ∼ 45 nm, most probably due to a higher cloud supersaturation, while f N only attained a maximum value ∼0.75. However, Case 3 is significantly different as most particles remained inactivated f N ∼ 0.1 at all measured sizes. These observations imply that activated aerosols are released back into the interstitial aerosol phase in Case 3 and to a lesser extent in Case 2 upon evaporation of cloud drops. Although ice crystals were not directly measured here, it will be established below that their formation and presence was highly probable, resulting in the observed aerosol partitioning. Further evidence is provided by satellite imagery from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer AVHRR aboard the NOAA-12 and 14 satellites which was used to determine the phase of clouds during Cases 1–3 by applying a pixel-based binary cloud phase discrimination method. AVHRR imagery at 1.1 and 4 km spatial resolution was analyzed at visible 0.63 μm , solar infrared 3.7 μm , and thermal infrared 11 and 12 μm channels, assuming a uniform snow surface cover within the pixel covering the JFJ site. Binary liquid/ice discrimination is expected to be reliable if one phase dominates the other in mixed-phase clouds. Total reflectance at 3.7 μm corrected for snow surface emissivity allowed the cloud phase to be determined, based on the assumption that the backscattered signal from liquid rather than ice crystals is generally larger in this spectral region. Figure 3 shows a satellite image of Switzerland during Case 3. This analysis yields a glaciated cloud in case 3, a supercooled cloud in case 1, and no conclusive results in case 2. On the other hand, results from a pixel-based analysis at the JFJ site “+” symbol in Figure 3 after D. Rosenfeld personal communication, 2003 suggest that cloud tops in Cases 2 and 3 consisted of supercooled droplets, while partial glaciation may have preferentially occurred below cloud top rather than at cloud top due to falling ice crystals. These disagreements therefore highlight the need for further research.AVHRR RGB image over Switzerland on March 4, 2000 Case 3 , obtained using red for the 0.6 μm channel, green for the enhanced 3.7 μm channel corrected for surface contributions , and blue for the 12 μm channel. The JFJ measurement site 46°33′N, 7°59′E is indicated by “+”, and the image area is 290 by 510 km. Snow areas appear as red patches 1 , and supercooled or glaciated droplets are yellow 2 . The snow and cloud-free land surface is generally warmer and shows up as a blue background.. As for Case 3, the winter cloud experienced S Ice ∼ 0 and S Liq < 0, and was most probably composed of ice crystals, frozen drops, and super-cooled liquid drops. The B-F mechanism depends strongly on drop size and ambient saturation and proceeds on the order of several seconds according to field and model studies. In summary, we consider that ice crystals were present in Cases 2 and 3 during the winter campaign, and led to mixed-phase and predominantly glaciated clouds, respectively. Observations of aerosol partitioning in natural mixed-phase, mid-latitude clouds presented here could have several important implications. Firstly, aerosols released back into the interstitial phase, may subsequently act as CCN, and be re-activated numerous times until removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition. Model studies suggest that such cloud processing in warm and cold clouds may enhance the concentration of ice nuclei by condensation and immersion freezing. Secondly, released aerosols could influence estimates of the aerosol indirect climate effect, especially as the B-F mechanism is parameterized independently of aerosol properties in all climate models. Thirdly, the simple partitioning of cloud water into liquid drops and ice crystals used in many climate models is an expedient approximation, however, it neglects the physics that is essential to determine the influence of ice nucleation on cloud water and hence climate. Although the one model that treats the essential physics does not separately predict activated and interstitial aerosol and hence cannot compare its aerosol activation with these observations, another model with most of the essential physics does. The observations in Figure 4 therefore provide a reference for assessing the influence of aerosols on liquid-phase, mixed-phase and glaciated clouds, and thereby for improving estimates of aerosol indirect effects. Although we cannot unambiguously prove that glaciated clouds were present, the balance of evidence strongly points towards this conclusion and will be addressed in an upcoming field campaign including comprehensive ice-phase measurements."
246,impact aerosol,"Relative importance of climate and land use in determining present and future global soil dust emission. The current consensus is that up to half of the modern atmospheric dust load originates from anthropogenically-disturbed soils. Here, we estimate the contribution to the atmospheric dust load from agricultural areas by calibrating a dust-source model with emission indices derived from dust-storm observations. Our results indicate that dust from agricultural areas contributes < 10% to the global dust load. Analyses of future changes in dust emissions under several climate and land-use scenarios suggest dust emissions may increase or decrease, but either way the effects of climate change will dominate dust emissions. . To understand historical and possible future changes in dust emissions, the percentage of atmospheric dust load originating from anthropogenic changes in land use must be quantified. It has been estimated that up to 50% of the modern dust originates from such sources, but these estimates are based on only two studies. One study estimated that disturbed areas comprised 20% of modern dust sources and assumed a comparable contribution to the atmospheric dust load, the other found a contribution of 30–50% from anthropogenically-disturbed soils needed to be added to modeled dust loads in order to match remotely sensed aerosol optical thickness. . Here we present a new estimate of contribution of dust emissions from agricultural sources according to RF99 and KG01 .

RF99 estimate the percentage of cultivation within each grid cell using remote sensing and statistical information. Here, we consider RF99 grid cells with <5% cultivation as equivalent to natural vegetation and distinguish cells with moderate 5–50% and with high >50% levels of cultivation. This subdivision was chosen to optimize the statistical significance of the results., and plant-available soil moisture, as measured by the ratio of actual to equilibrium evapotranspiration α Figure 1 . However, median and mean DSFs from agricultural sites are significantly higher than those from non-agricultural sites in non-forest regions Figures 1a and 1c , except in the case of regions with very low vegetation cover <10% FPAR . The difference between DSFs from agricultural and natural sites is less marked when the records are grouped by α, indicating that the differences within each vegetation-cover class reflect differences in vegetation cover caused by land use.Dependence of DSF in non-forested areas on vegetation cover and plant available soil moisture in different land-use categories. Vegetation cover is indicated by FPAR, and soil moisture by α see text . The top two panels show DSFs in natural vegetation, rangeland and cropland KG01 . The bottom two panels show DSFs in natural vegetation, intermediate-level cultivation and intensive cultivation RF99 . Median DSFs are marked by horizontal lines, the means by stars, and the box limits correspond to the 25th and 75th percentiles. The vertical line indicates the maximum range of the data.. Dust emissions were computed for 10 years 1983 to 1992 , using meteorological fields sampled at 6-hourly intervals from the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecast reanalysis. For comparison with the observations we defined a day in which dust emission occurred in the model as ‘dust storm day’ for the respective model gridcell. The dust emission model underestimates the number of days on which emissions occur in regions of natural vegetation by a factor of two the slope is 0.56* observed DSF in KG01 natural vegetation and 0.53* observed DSF in RF99 areas with <5% cultivation; neither regression shows a significant offset from zero . This discrepancy arises because the temporal and spatial sampling scales of the model are coarser than those of the observations. We apply a global correction by lowering the wind stress threshold for dust emission by 0.86. This correction raised simulated DSFs to a comparable magnitude as observed DSFs in regions of natural non-forested vegetation Table 1 . Simulated DSFs are still smaller than observed DSFs from agricultural sites in non-forested regions Table 1 . In those grid cells we therefore further lowered the wind stress threshold required to initiate dust emission that matches the observed increase in DSFs for agricultural sites. The required additional wind stress correction factor is 0.93 for rangeland and 0.73 for cropland KG01 , and 0.86 for intermediate-level 5–50% and 0.70 for intensive >50% cultivation RF99 . The global contribution of dust emission from agricultural soils, computed from the difference between the simulated emission fluxes for the baseline case Figure 2a and the lowered-threshold case Figure 2b , is then 5% RF99 or 7% KG01 . This is less than one fifth of the previous estimates of the anthropogenic contributions to the total dust load.Modelled annual dust emissions. a Modern dust emission from natural soils; b dust emissions from cultivated soils, based on the KG01 distribution of rangeland and cropland; c difference between a scenario of future dust emissions for the years 2040–2050 and emissions for 1970–1980 for natural soils, computed with meteorological fields from ECHAM4 with IS92a IPCC scenario; and d as c , but including increased dust emissions from cultivated soils, according to the IPCC A2 scenario; e difference between a scenario of future dust emissions for the years 2070–2080 and emissions for1970–1980 for natural soils, computed with meteorological fields from HADCM3 with IS92a IPCC scenario; and f as e but including increased dust emission from cultivated soils, according to the IPCC A2 scenario.The numbers in brackets are the 25th to 75th percentile range of the observations and model results.

The results are averaged for grid cells which contain stations. Differences in bold indicate that modeled and observed mean values are significantly different at the 0.01 level for square-root transformed data. to estimate future dust emissions. We forced the dust model with T106 meteorological fields based on the ECHAM4-OPYC model for the years 1970–1980 and 2040–2050, and with meteorological fields from the HADCM3 model for the years 1970–1980 and 2070–2080, both with 12-hourly time intervals. The computed modern annual dust emissions differ by ca. 20% for different wind fields. Daily changes in vegetation cover were computed based on the vegetation-phenology model BIOME4 forced by the simulated temperature, precipitation and surface radiation fields. Thus, the simulated changes in dust emissions reflect both changes in vegetation cover, including the effect of the enhanced atmospheric CO 2 concentration on vegetation density, and changes in meteorological variables that directly influence dust emission. In additional simulations in which the vegetation was allowed to respond to simulated future climate changes without taking into account the potential for CO 2 fertilization to increase tree productivity and vegetation cover, dust emissions increased by 17% in the ECHAM4 run and were reduced by only 7% in the HADCM3 run Table 2 , which reflects the potential importance of CO2 fertilization for decreasing dust source areas. representing maximum A2 and minimum B1 estimates of increases in agricultural areas between now and 2050, and assumed maximally increased emissions from agricultural compared to natural areas by using the derived correction factors from KG01. Dust emissions in the ECHAM4-driven simulation increased from 9% natural sources to between 21% B1 scenario and 24% A2 scenario, Figure 2d when emissions from anthropogenic soils are included. The reduction in emissions shown in the HADCM3-driven simulation with natural sources −19% is less when potential expansion of agricultural sources is taken into account −8%, Scenario A2, Figure 2f . In the simulations, increased agriculture acts to increase dust emissions, but the effect is never large enough to counter the effects of climate change.. We ran sensitivity simulations to examine the impact of possible improvements in cultivation techniques Table 2 , assuming no expansion in agricultural area and a 3-fold lowering of dust emissions due to improved cultivation methods in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. The increase in global emissions in 2050 compared to 1970 in the A2 ECHAM4-driven simulation was only 14%, considerably less than the expected 21–24% increase resulting from future expansion of agricultural areas. Improved cultivation resulted in dust emissions comparable to natural emissions in the HADCM3-driven simulation. Agricultural regions are not the only source of anthropogenic dust. We have not considered possible changes in sources through deforestation, but such areas probably contribute <10% to anthropogenic dust overall. We have also not considered urban dust e.g., from construction , dust emissions from dirt roads and military operations in desert areas, but the influence of these sources is likely to be local and relatively small at global scale. Changes in soil hydrology by irrigation could also change the dust source areas, which may be of particular importance in topographic depressions that are preferential source areas for dust emission; this possible effect needs to be further investigated. Uncertainties about the role of dust in future climate are caused by our current inability to determine the direction of climate-induced change in dust-emissions in response to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations."
247,particles ocean,"Light reflected by an atmosphere containing irregular mineral dust aerosol. We simulate polarimetric satellite observations of sunlight reflected by a turbid atmosphere over the ocean. We determine the sensitivity of these observations with respect to the optical thickness and the single-scattering albedo of irregular mineral aerosol. Simulated results indicate that both quantities can be retrieved from simultaneous polarization and intensity measurements. Aerosol scattering is modelled using a true measured scattering matrix of irregularly-shaped mineral dust aerosol. We study the suitability of various approximations of the particle shape used for the numerical calculation of scattering matrices. Approximations with spheres or spheroids with a distribution of moderate axis ratios can lead to large errors of the simulated light intensities. A spheroidal approximation including extreme axis ratios is found to be the most appropriate one for simulations of light scattering by irregular mineral aerosol particles, if measured scattering matrices are not available. . The amount of dust raised and the atmospheric residence time depend strongly on the meteorological conditions and depend amongst others on the size of the particles. Satellite observations of reflected sunlight are used to monitor dust aerosols and to estimate their climatic effect. However, the retrieval of the aerosol load as well as its microphysical properties from satellite measurements of reflected sunlight remains difficult. For a unique solution multi-spectral multi-angle measurements including both the intensity as well as the polarization are necessary. that is representative for atmospheric mineral aerosol. The dust sample includes a large variety of highly irregular shapes as we observed on SEM-graphs not shown ., albeit with constraints that are due to computing time and convergence criteria of the numerical code. We compare the measured scattering matrix with calculations for ensembles of particles with the projected area equivalent size distribution and the refractive index of the dust sample section 2 . Firstly, we use a spherical shape approximation. Secondly, we approximate the aerosol with an ensemble of randomly oriented oblate and prolate spheroids with moderate axis ratios. Finally, we consider a distribution of spheroidal shapes that includes extreme axis ratios up to the convergence limit of the quadruple precision version of the T-matrix code for each size. We estimate the suitability of the shape approximations for aerosol retrievals. For this purpose, we use the reflectance simulations based on the measured scattering matrix as the reference and compare them with simulations based on calculated scattering matrices section 3 ., while the imaginary part is adopted from other weakly absorbing silicate minerals mica . The size distribution measured is characterized by an effective radius  For comparison we consider 3 types of numerically determined scattering matrices. Firstly, the irregularly-shaped aerosol is approximated with an ensemble of spherical particles with the projected area equivalent size distribution of the dust sample. The scattering matrix is then calculated using the Lorenz-Mie theory. Secondly, the irregularly-shaped aerosol is approximated with an ensemble of randomly oriented oblate and prolate spheroids indicate that discrepancies of the element [2001] instead of Lorenz-Mie calculations.[16]  Simultaneous observations of the polarization and the intensity are sensitive to the single-scattering albedo as well as the aerosol optical thickness. Such observations in geometries where the sun glint contributes weakly to the observed signal provide independent information about the single-scattering albedo and the aerosol optical thickness, provided that the specular reflection is described accurately.[17]  Based on our sensitivity studies, we conclude that the aerosol optical thickness and the single-scattering albedo retrieved using the observation geometries studied, may comprise large error contributions, if the particle shape is approximated by spheres or spheroids with moderate axis ratios. Polarimetric observations of light scattered by irregular mineral aerosol appear to be best, although not perfectly, represented by simulations using the spheroidal shape approximation including small particles with extreme axis ratios. The presented results indicate that the use of measured scattering data instead of models using simple shape approximations has the potential to improve aerosol retrievals and radiative forcing estimates."
249,dust,"Sensitivity of TOMS aerosol index to boundary layer height: Implications for detection of mineral aerosol sources. The TOMS aerosol index AI is proposed as a powerful tool in determining the sources of mineral aerosols. The sensitivity of the AI to the height of the aerosol layer has been noted previously, but the implications of this sensitivity for deducing sources has not been explicitly considered. Here, we present a methodology and sensitivity test to show the importance of spatial and temporal variations of the planetary boundary layer height to deducing sources using the AI. These results suggest that while dry topographic low sources may be large sources of desert dust, conclusions eliminating other sources may be premature, especially when these sources occur on the edges of deserts, where boundary layer heights are lower, and human influences potentially more important. The compounding problem of differentiating downwind transport and local sources suggests it may not currently be possible to use the AI to conclusively determine mineral aerosol source regions. . In situ studies of the soil particle size distribution and chemical and mineralogical characteristics can provide data about easily erodible soils, but global maps of these characteristics are not available at the resolution required. The and  The presence of uv-absorbing aerosol amount is detected from TOMS measurements using a spectral contrast method in a UV region where the ozone absorption is very small. In cloud free conditions, this measurement called the TOMS aerosol index or AI depends on the amount, size distribution, optical properties and height of absorbing aerosols, the presence of clouds and the viewing geometry. Here we would like to calculate the TOMS AI as a function of optical depth and PBLH. We consider desert dust particles close to the sources and thus, to allow intercomparison, we use the particle size distribution of the “d3” aerosol type from and we have verified that our results were almost insensitive to these conditions. The atmospheric radiative transfer is computed with the SBDART code that incorporates the LOWTRAN7 band models and the DISORT discrete ordinate method. Our computations reproduce the published results of  We assume a simple vertical profile with dust in the boundary layer, with a linearly decreasing mixing ratio of mineral aerosol with height and the concentration of zero above the planetary boundary layer height PBLH . This aerosol distribution is the solution to a Fick's Law type vertical diffusion, assuming there is a constant surface flux with strong mixing and removal from the column at the top of the boundary layer presumably transport downwind . For this aerosol vertical profile, our calculation using the SBDART code for the dependence of the TOMS AI with the PBLH is displayed in Figure 1 for various aerosol optical thicknesses. Sensitivity tests suggest that parameters which have uncertainties e.g., vertical aerosol profile, index of refraction or size distribution do not change the almost linear relationship between PBLH and TOMS AI, although they do change the slope of the relationship. If instead, optical properties from not shown . TOMS AI retrievals from satellite also depend on cloud reflectivity—here we exclude days when the reflectivity is higher than 0.2, to exclude cloudy pixels.Dependence of the TOMS AI at 340 nm, defined as the 340 nm residue, as a function of the PBLH, for various aerosol optical thicknesses at 380 nm. The aerosol mixing ratio decreases linearly with height and reaches zero at the top of the PBL. The aerosol size distribution follows a lognormal distribution r 0 = 0.50 μm, σ = 2.2 and the refractive index comes from . We archived daily averaged values, however, and the diurnal cycle in boundary layer heights is very strong, especially in desert areas. The TOMS AI is calculated from satellite observations close to noon local time. From a 10-day simulation of the diurnal cycle in the model, we calculate that the best estimate of the 11am–1pm boundary layer height from the daily average boundary layer height is noon average = daily average * 24-nighttime average * 12 /12 , where the nighttime average is 200m for more information, see the auxiliary material . The monthly averaged noon boundary layer heights for January and July are shown in Figure 2 for 1981. The noon averaged boundary layer heights are very high greater than 3 km in some desert regions in the dry season, and much lower elsewhere 500–1000 m , even in adjoining regions, as well as in the wet season or winter. The seasonality and height of the boundary layers over arid regions appear to be consistent with our understanding of boundary layer heights and available observations.Monthly averaged local noon boundary layer heights for January a and July b , 1981, from the MATCH model, in km. as dominant sources. This suggests the possibility that these regions are not necessarily the strongest sources, but rather regions with high PBLH with desert dust aerosols. For the Bodele basin, for example, if the source was upwind to the northeast, boundary layer heights go from 1.8 to 3.0 km in a short distance. Thus dust from these dust sources may have a substantially higher TOMS AI when they are advected downwind over the Bodele basin where they will be vertically mixed. Note that the highest boundary layer heights are associated with regions where the sensible heat flux is greatest, and latent heat flux is small due to lack of vegetation and water sources. In addition in desert regions there are few clouds, thereby increasing the surface absorption of solar radiation however the surface albedo of deserts versus vegetated regions will tend to counter these effects . Thus, boundary layer heights in very arid regions in the central part of the desert may be systematically higher and result in higher TOMS AI for the same source strength than in slightly wetter regions on the edges of deserts, where humans disturbance is more likely.TOMS AI thresholds refered to as PBLH-thresholds in text , assuming an optical thickness of 0.5 in Figure 1 , and the boundary layer heights in Figure 2 for January a and July b , 1981.. Figure 2 . Next we calculate the frequency that the satellite retrieved TOMS AI is above the PBLH-thresholds shown in Figures 4b, 4d, and 4f for January, July, and November, respectively . Note that if we looked at the percentage of retrieval days with high dust instead of absolute number of days we would obtain similar results. An important effect of using the PBLH-threshold, compared with using the fixed-threshold is to change the very strong seasonal cycle seen in previous studies, to be more consistent with visibility studies of the region, which show much less dust during the summer. We will not address the biomass burning sources, such as in Africa between about 10°N and 15°S, nor TOMS AI over ocean regions. Notice that in July, 1981, the frequency of high dust seen in North Africa between 15°N and 30°N west of 0°E is higher than east of 0°E, implying that the dust is not advected e.g., from Bodele basin , but rather appear to be from a local source in this analysis. It is not possible to determine whether this large area of high dust frequency is more consistent with the ‘disturbed’ sources suggested by would use these months to suggest the location of the sources during the whole year. This sensitivity study suggests that in January or November, the removal of the effect of boundary layer height on the TOMS AI increases the area with days with ‘significant’ aerosol amounts substantially in the western part of the Sahel, on the southern edge of the Sahara, and changes them very little in the central desert regions. Again, these regions appear to be local sources, not downwind advection from the Bodele basin. The methodology of choosing the month in which the index is generally lowest, and suggesting that the areas with many days above the ‘significant’ threshold are the most important sources during other times of the year may not be robust. In some areas, there may be low wind speeds as well as low planetary boundary layer heights during the low TOMS AI months, and that may be why there is less mineral aerosols detected by the TOMS AI. Other months may have very different sources. use mean TOMS AI. These studies have suggested that most of the mineral aerosol comes from dry lake beds in the current climate and not from the large expanses of desert such as the Sahara-an important observation that has assisted many global modelers in improving their mineral aerosol simulations. In addition, they argue that the topographic low source areas are not substantially impacted by anthropogenic activities., the TOMS AI is sensitive to the height of the aerosol layer. We have conducted a simple sensitivity study here, where we use a monthly and spatially varying threshold based on boundary layer height to identify the source regions for one year; 1981. The inclusion of the boundary layer height based thresholds suggests that previous studies may have underestimated the importance of sources on the edges of deserts or other areas where the boundary layer depths are systematically lower than in topographic lows in the central desert regions. For example, in Figure 4e , the high TOMS AI across North Africa at 15–20N west of 0E appears to not be downwind advection from the Bodele basin, but rather a local source of the potentially the same strength as the Bodele basin. This region is a region with roads and is likely to have human impacts. Thus, the TOMS AI is consistent with anthropogenic sources of dust if the sensitivity of the TOMS AI to boundary layer height is included., Gillette [1988] offer invaluable data about the erodibility of soils. These types of surface oriented studies are required to eliminate or confirm source regions on a global scale. Nevertheless, the TOMS AI represents an excellent long term series of measurements enabling us to better understand the sources, transport, distribution and deposition of mineral aerosols."
250,aerosol,"Evidence of the control of summer atmospheric transport of African dust over the Atlantic by Sahel sources from TOMS satellites (1979-2000). We used 18 years 1979 - 1992 and 1997 - 2000 of aerosol observations from TOMS satellites to monitor the inter-annual variability of summertime atmospheric dust optical thickness over both Atlantic and Africa. A comparison of TOMS dust optical thicknesses with ground-based Sun-photometer measurements shows that our long-term data set is consistent in time and space and is thus suitable for studying the interannual and decadal variability of African dust transport. Our results show that dust emissions in North western Sahel are so variable from one year to the other that they control most of the variability of summer dust transport to the tropical Atlantic. Our satellite data also demonstrate that there is a large scale correlation between Atlantic dust export and Sahel drought during the previous year, which suggests that dust emissions in this semi-arid region are likely controlled by the position of the vegetated southern boundary of the Sahara. , likely decreases precipitations and transports microbes that might significantly affect human health. Former studies based on surface measurements and satellite images have shown that climate variability controls the African dust export.. This archive has recently been used to locate major dust sources and to monitor the dust optical thickness DOT over ocean. and in 1997 for TOMS/Earth-Probe. Daily METEOSAT data for the period 1995–1997 were processed with the algorithm of . The statistical relationship between METEOSAT DOT at 0.55 μm and TOMS/Earth-Probe AAI for summer April–September is DOT = 0.45 AAI − 0.01. performed between 1997 and 2000 at Cape Verde Islands ○; 160 measurements , Dakar Senegal; □; 78 measurements , and Banizoumbou Niger; ; 99 measurements . Nimbus7/TOMS DOT are compared to measurements performed during three years 1986–1988 at Gao Mali; •; 42 measurements and during spring 1986 and 1987 at M'Bour Senegal; ▪; 21 measurements . AERONET level 2.0 daily averages of optical thickness at 0.44 and 0.67 μm were interpolated to derive DOT at 0.55 μm. At Gao, daily DOT was estimated from optical thickness measurements at 0.50 μm taken at 9:00, 12:00, and 14:30 GMT. At M'Bour, daily DOT was computed from measurements made at 0.55 μm with the “Proche Infrarouge Radiometer” Sun-photometer. The linear regression between TOMS and Sun-Photometer DOT for the 400 measurements gives a slope of 1.08 ± 0.02 and a correlation coefficient of 0.82. and is maximum between 15 and 22°N. Major sources during summer are located in southwestern Sahara, mainly between 18°N and 25°N in Mauritania, Mali and southern Algeria. Further East, the Bodele depression Chad is also one of the most active African dust source. The standard deviation of DOT in Figure 2b shows the high inter-annual variability of summer dust transport over western Africa and tropical Atlantic. This large-scale inter-annual variability is what makes these aerosols so difficult to account for in climate modelling because it is controlled by multiple phenomena, from the large-scale meteorology to the local weather conditions at the source. a Map of the mean summer dust optical thickness DOT over Africa and Atlantic computed from June to August TOMS daily images for the 18 years of daily images of the TOMS/Nimbus-7 1979–1992 and TOMS/Earth Probe 1997–2000 sensors; b Map of the standard deviation of mean summer DOT over the 18 years. Inter-annual changes in dust emission over semi-arid regions can basically be due to a combination of the following three factors: a change of mean wind intensity dynamical impact , a change of the atmospheric washout of dust particles washout impact and a change in soil characteristics such as humidity or vegetation coverage drought impact . Former studies have shown that the North Atlantic Oscillation NAO , which controls the large-scale atmospheric circulation over Atlantic, western Africa and Europe, has an impact on the African dust export. It has also been suggested that Sahel drought controls the dust emissions., to address the dynamical impact, and to a Sahel Drought SD index, to evidence both rainfall and drought impacts. Our SD index is defined as the opposite of the Sahel rainfall departure index of and Sahel rainfall departure indices with the two indices that we selected because they fully cover our analysis period., and that this drought is thus responsible for most of the variability in summer dust export to the tropical North Atlantic.Map of the correlation coefficient of the year-to-year variability of the mean summer DOT with the previous-year SD index. Negative respectively positive SD values indicate wet respectively dry conditions. A correlation coefficient of 0.5 corresponds to a significance level of 95% and a correlation coefficient of 0.6 to a significance level of 99%. who found a correlation coefficient of 0.49 between summer Atlantic DOT and NAO index using 12 years 1983–1994 of daily METEOSAT DOT, whereas their NAO/DOT correlation for wintertime has been recently confirmed using TOMS data. This misinterpretation of the summertime dust export by  The correlation coefficient between Atlantic and Sahel DOT in Figure 5 is of 0.87 and is of 0.59 between previous-year SD index and Sahel DOT. These results confirm the drought control on the inter-annual variability of the summer tropical Atlantic dust export. The correlation coefficient between same-year SD index and Sahel DOT is 0.17. In contrast, this correlation coefficient remains high r = 0.40 for the year-2 SD index and drops down to a low value r = 0.16 for the year-3 SD index. Since there is a very slight correlation between SD indices of two consecutive years r = 0.26 over the 22 years shown in Figure 5 , this suggests that Sahel drought impacts dust sources for about two years., even if such an impact is still highly uncertain. Only a combination of numerical modelling with long series of satellite data and of in-situ observations will enable to separate the respective impacts of natural and anthropogenic soil degradation on Sahel dust emissions and their role in regional climate change."
251,particles ocean,"Impact of air pollution on wet deposition of mineral dust aerosols. [1] Mineral dust aerosols originating from arid regions are simulated in an atmospheric global chemical transport model. Based on model results and observations of dust concentration, we hypothesize that air pollution increases the scavenging of dust by producing high levels of readily soluble materials on the dust surface, which makes dust aerosols effective cloud condensation nuclei CCN . This implies that air pollution could have caused an increase of dust deposition to the coastal oceans of East Asia and a decrease by as much as 50% in the eastern North Pacific. . However, aged dust aerosols are often coated with soluble materials such as sulfate and nitrate resulting from heterogeneous chemical reactions. Dust aerosols are effective ice nuclei in the atmosphere. Whether they are good droplet nuclei depends on the content of ions on the particle surface and the competition of other cloud condensation nuclei such as sea-salt and sulfate aerosols. Here we present modeling results that, in combination with observations, suggest dust aerosols coated with sulfate and nitrate ions are effective droplet nuclei hydrophilic , but non-reacted ones are not hydrophobic, or droplets form but do not grow to the size threshold for onset of precipitation . was used for this study. It has equal-area horizontal grids with 265 km resolution. The model was adapted to use NCEP reanalysis winds, archived every 6 hours, on the same 28 vertical sigma levels. The NCEP winds were linearly interpolated horizontally to the center point of GCTM grid-cells. Vertical velocities are calculated from horizontal mass divergence and the surface pressure tendency.. In the surface mixed layer, K z is calculated from the surface momentum flux and vertical wind shear, both of which are derived from the NCEP reanalysis, using an approximation that momentum flux is constant with altitude. The boundary layer height is diagnosed from the gradient Richardson number Ri < 1.0 . Diffusion is enhanced for deep convection whose height is diagnosed from the moist Richardson number Ri < 0.25 . Grid-scale advection is calculated using a finite difference scheme. The advection time step is 26 minutes, and the vertical diffusion time step is 2.6 minutes. Model transport has been evaluated by comparing model results to observed SF 6 , CO 2 , and 222 Rn in the atmosphere.: where C is a scaling factor = 0.008 kg m −5 s 2 , S x, y is a function of longitude x and latitude y that specifies the spatial distribution of dust sources taken from . The original S x, y is doubled in Taklimakan and Gobi deserts to increase model dust concentrations at the Asian sites. The magnitude of u* t depends on soil moisture and surface roughness. However, we choose to use u* t = 0.35 m s −1 everywhere based on a lack of spatial data on surface roughness. We neglect the influence of soil moisture on the desert sources, where annual rainfall is low <0.2 m and surface soils are dry.. Transport of dust is simulated separately for 8 size bins 0.2–0.36, 0.36–0.6, 0.6–1.2, 1.2–2.0, 2.0–3.6, 3.6–6, 6–12, and 12–20 μm in diameter . Larger particles >20 μm settle out of the atmosphere quickly, with a lifetime less than half a day. The model size distribution is compared to measurements in Asia, North Pacific, and North Atlantic in another paper.. In-cloud scavenging is assumed to be 100 percent for hydrophilic aerosols. The wet-deposition parameterization is modified in this study for hydrophobic dust aerosols. Scavenging of hydrophobic aerosols is set to zero by droplet nucleation, and is 100 percent when ice nucleation occurs ambient temperature below 258 K in stable clouds or in a convective column. The model uses precipitation from the NCEP reanalysis, which tends to under-estimate annual precipitation by up to 20 percent in wet areas of the tropical oceans and over the storm tracks of the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres. The wet deposition has been evaluated by comparing modeled 7 Be and 210 Pb to observations.,. The neutralizing capacity of calcite forming gypsum by reaction with sulfuric acid is related to Σ. The simplified aging model is admittedly a crude representation of the processes.. It is noted that the modeled seasonal variations of dust concentration are in phase with surface observations and the total dust deposition fluxes are in agreement with oceanic measurements, which will be presented elsewhere. The observations range over 2 orders of magnitude, while uncertainties of the data are usually less than a factor of 2. The distances of transport from dust sources to measurement sites are ordered numerically 1–4 in the North Atlantic and alphabetically A–R in the North Pacific Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c . The spatial gradient from Izaña to Barbados to Bermuda and Miami in the North Atlantic is well simulated by S1, but that from coastal China to Japan to remote sites in the North Pacific is not, as indicated by increasing error with distance Figure 1a . By contrast, the agreement between observations and S2 results is good within a factor of 2 in the North Pacific, but that in the North Atlantic is degraded Figure 1b . It is noted that previous models tend to over-predict the spatial gradient in the North Atlantic as in S2 and/or under-predict that in the North Pacific as in S1 , depending on the parameterization for wet deposition of dust aerosols.Model vs. observed annual average dust concentrations for a hydrophobic, b hydrophilic, and c chemical aging simulations.

The solid line indicates a 1:1 relation; the dotted lines indicate 1:2 and 2:1 relations.. These ions would make the dust aerosols hydrophilic. Sulfate is also observed in Saharan dust aerosols. However, sulfate may be present in solid anhydrite or gypsum, which are not readily soluble.. At stations near the sources e.g., Izaña and Qingdao , the results from all three simulations are similar, reflecting the short time of transport for chemical aging and occurrence of wet deposition. At stations farther away, the S3 results are in agreement with observations at the Atlantic sites and at Pacific sites near the Asian coast. The S3 results are more than twice as high as the observations at the remote Pacific sites Figure 1c , implying perhaps more rapid chemical aging e.g., by reactions with N 2 O 5 and HNO 3 than calculated in the model. The model biases at Midway and Oahu could have resulted in part from the under-estimation of annual precipitation over the storm track in the North Pacific.. The modeled scavenging ratio in simulation S3 is indeed 5 times higher for hydrophilic dust in the North Pacific than for hydrophobic dust in the tropical North Atlantic. This is consistent with our hypothesis that Asian dust is aged chemically in air pollution plumes and is more readily removed by droplet nucleation.. It has been observed that phytoplankton growth can be limited by iron supply in high nitrate low chlorophyll regions including the Northeast Pacific. Dust storm enhancement of carbon biomass was observed in the NPO, suggesting a biotic response to natural iron fertilization by the dust. Figure 2 shows the ratios S2/S1 of dust deposition to the NPO. The ratios are calculated from dust depositions averaged over five years. Dust deposition to the coastal oceans off of East Asia is increased, but that to the northeast NPO is decreased by as much as 50% from S1 to S2. Such a decrease of dust deposition to the NPO could have occurred from pre-industrial time to the present due to the rise of air pollution in East Asia. On the other hand, soluble iron may be increased when mineral dust is coated with acidic aqueous solution of sulfate, which would increase aeolian iron supply to the surface ocean.Ratio of dust deposition dry + wet predicted for hydrophilic aerosol to that for hydrophobic aerosol in the North Pacific. Contour lines are super-imposed on the coastlines.[14]  In conclusion, chemical reactions of air pollutants on the surface of mineral dust are hypothesized to change the lifetime of dust aerosols in the atmosphere and its deposition to the oceans. Modeling of mineral dust may be improved in the future by including heterogeneous reactions, the chemical and mineralogical compositions of soils, concurrent gas phase chemistry, and more advanced physical parameterizations. This study suggests that the CCN activity of dust aerosols needs to be investigated under varying levels of air pollution. Air pollution may influence iron supply to the remote oceans, affecting diatom biomass and causing potential ecological changes in marine ecosystems."
252,climate ocean,"Bias characteristics in the AVHRR sea surface temperature. To provide possible means to improve future satellite SST retrieval algorithms and to provide data users with error information, spatiotemporal bias patterns in the 1982-2002 NOAA operational AVHRR SST were characterized. At the start of one NOAA-14 satellite mission, typical global average biases were about -0.05degreesC, and gradually increased during the satellite mission. Normally global averages rarely exceeded 0.2degreesC, due to cancellation of larger biases of opposite signs in different regions. Biases were inhomogeneous and locally exceeded 0.5degreesC even in the 21-year time mean. Large irregular biases were due to stratospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions. Seasonal biases were strongly related to local weather phenomena, such as seasonal dust aerosols and cloud covers. The findings suggest that future satellite SST retrieval algorithms should be time and space dependent.  , the Along Track Scanning Radiometer ATSR; , and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS; . Satellite SST is not directly measured, but deduced from directly measured parameters e.g., AVHRR radiances . The deductions may be based on semi-empirical formulae obtained from correlation studies. The AVHRR satellite “brightness” temperatures are usually regressed against selected in situ observations to produce “bulk” SSTs, despite that infrared AVHRR SSTs physically represent only a very thin ∼10 μm ocean skin layer due to sea water's high emissivity. Tuning to the bulk SST is done for historical reasons and for lack of skin SST measurements. Also, because the skin layer is so thin, the bulk SST representing the ocean mixed layer is more suitable for climate study than skin and diurnal SSTs. Thus we focus on the AVHRR SSTs calibrated to bulk SSTs.. Although great care was exercised in developing and calibrating the satellite SST algorithms, they were done over limited areas, under limited atmospheric conditions, and for particular conditions of satellite sensors and tracks; http://www2.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/podug/ . Thus spatiotemporal biases still existed. Adjustments to operational algorithms were delayed in time following volcanic eruptions e.g., Mt. Pinatubo erupted in June 1991 with biases appearing in July. The operational corrections were implemented from early October 1991 . Figure 1 shows the AVHRR SST biases in September 1991, with maximum biases larger than 2°C. Here the AVHRR SST biases are statistically characterized. The findings should be useful for improving satellite SST algorithms for retroactive analysis and for future satellite SST missions.September 1991 AVHRR SST biases °C following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. The biases are computed using the method described in Section 2 .. In situ SSTs have been measured by ships and drifting and moored buoys. The history of in situ SST measurements and analyses was discussed by , and described the optimum interpolation OI in details. The AVHRR SST biases are referenced to in situ SSTs. This is done by an optional Poisson procedure completed prior to the OI analysis. The Poisson step removes satellite SST biases with respect to the in situ SSTs. To extract the AVHRR SST biases, OIs with and without the bias correction bc were done. The corresponding OI SSTs are denoted as T_bc and T_no.bc . Since satellite SST observations overwhelm in situ data, the influence of in situ SSTs on the OI SSTs without the bias correction is minimal. Therefore we define the AVHRR SST bias, B , as the difference: . The analyses were done on the monthly 1° × 1° AVHRR SST biases B from January 1982 to December 2002. The EOF decomposition has the advantage of compressing data most efficiently using a few dominant spatiotemporal modes. Spatial projections of these modes reveal patterns, and temporal projections reveal sequences of events.  Figure 2b shows the temporal variation of the globally averaged biases. The biggest events in 1982/1983, 1991/1992 and 2000/2001 are due to El Chichón and Mt. Pinatubo eruptions and the deteriorating performance of the NOAA-14 satellite at the end of its mission, respectively. Although the NOAA-16 satellite was launched in September 2000, new operational SST retrieval algorithms were not available until March 2001. This underscores the importance of overlapping satellite missions. The peaks in 1992–1995 were due to a satellite calibration error discussed in Reynolds   Figure 3 shows the percent variances of the first 25 EOFs. The variance decreases rapidly with mode number. Contributions from mode 1 to 6 are 27.4%, 10.8%, 8.2%, 4.2%, 3.2% and 2.2%, respectively. All other modes account for less than 2% individually. The higher modes have smaller spatial scales, indicating they are likely associated with errors and/or localized atmospheric phenomena.Percent variances of the first 25 modes on the AVHRR SST biases with mean removed. Mode 1 describes relatively rare events which are unpredictable. Fortunately these large biases can be easily identified and may be at least partially removed by special post-event algorithm changes. However, Mt. Pinatubo biases remain even in the post-processed Pathfinder AVHRR SST, and the globally averaged Pathfinder SST biases are no less than that of the operational SST biases. In contrast to the rare events, regularly occurring biases could be removed or reduced by improvements to real time operational satellite algorithms. Examples of these biases are the mean biases described above and the seasonal biases described below.. Biases in the northern oceans are positive in July, revealing the algorithms' deficiency in these regions. These biases are co-located with the maximum and persistent cloud covers e.g., cloud climatology at the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/ , although there is no physical reason for positive biases by clouds. This is likely linked to the deficiencies of globally tuned algorithms.Same as Figure 4 but for Mode #2 a, b and #3 c, d .[13]  Over the years the operational AVHRR SST retrieval algorithms have progressed from the early multi-channel linear retrieval to the current nonlinear retrieval. However all the algorithms are spatially independent. When a new satellite is launched, a new SST retrieval algorithm is developed and calibrated for its track and onboard instruments. The algorithm is then applied globally and remains the same during the lifetime of the satellite's mission unless major biases are identified e.g., due to volcanic eruptions . In the latter cases special algorithms might be developed. We analyzed the statistical spatial and temporal patterns of the historical monthly AVHRR SST biases from January 1982 to December 2002, to assess the performance of the time- and space-independent operational AVHRR SST retrieval algorithms. Similar bias characterizations could be performed for other and recent satellite SST products.[14]  For the globally tuned algorithms, the global average biases were generally small. However, the biases were inhomogeneous and large in certain areas. Even in the 21-year climatological mean, the biases can be larger than 0.5°C. Areas with globally unrepresentative atmospheric thermal structure or aerosols showed greatest biases. Regions with atmospheric inversions and undetected warm clouds relative to the ocean surface emit more infrared radiance IR for a given SST. This results in positive AVHRR SST biases from a globally tuned algorithm. Likewise, regions or occasions with more aerosols than implicit in the global tuning emit less IR for a given SST, resulting negative biases. The spatial inhomogeneity of the biases indicates that spatially dependent satellite SST retrieval algorithms are necessary.[15]  In the time domain, Modes 2 to 4 showed strong seasonality and Mode 5 showed a trend in time not shown . Time trends lasting several years were also revealed in the time series of the global mean and Mode 1. These indicate that time-dependent satellite SST retrieval algorithms may also be needed. The fact that coherent and regularly occurring patterns exist in the dominant modes is encouraging and useful. The seasonality could be used to guide improvements of the satellite SST algorithms with simplified time-dependence. The results have their implications for future satellite SST missions. The temporal patterns also showed the importance of overlapping satellite missions.[16]  The spatiotemporal bias patterns are apparently related to seasonal weather phenomena, such as the dust aerosols from the African deserts and the seasonal clouds over the northwest basins of North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Proper parameterization of the retrieval sensitivity to these phenomena may also help to reduce the AVHRR SST biases."
253,aerosol,"Atmospheric deposition of nutrients to the Atlantic Ocean. The role of atmospheric deposition of iron, nitrogen and phosphorus in supplying nutrients to marine systems has been described, individually, in previous works. Here we examine atmospheric dry deposition of all these nutrients simultaneously, using samples collected during two meridional transects of the Atlantic Ocean. We find that, in line with previous work, desert dust supplies excess iron to the water column. However, primary production promoted by aerosol nitrogen can be sufficient to consume all of the soluble aerosol iron input in some situations. Aerosol N:P is universally very high, so that aerosol is always deficient in P relative to phytoplankton requirements. Nitrogen fixation stimulated by any excess atmospheric iron supply and phytoplankton utilisation of atmospheric nutrient inputs will therefore tend to drive the ecosystem towards P limitation. This emphasises the need to study the biogeochemical impact of atmospheric nutrient deposition in an integrated manner. , because iron's low solubility in seawater makes atmospheric transport the dominant source of Fe to the remote ocean. This may be of particular importance in High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll areas, where Fe is thought to limit primary production. Nitrogen deposition can significantly contribute to eutrophication problems in coastal areas, but there are very few studies of atmospheric phosphorus supply to the ocean. These studies have concentrated on atmospheric inputs of individual nutrients. Here however, we examine dry deposition of Fe, N and P along two meridional transects of the Atlantic Ocean because we believe that the impact of atmospheric nutrient supply is dependent on the relative rate at which nutrients are supplied with respect to plankton requirements.. Major ion collection for ANT18-1 used a single Whatman 41 paper only, while for JCR a 3-stage cascade impactor and Whatman 41 papers were used. Whatman 41 papers are known to also collect gas phase nitric acid and, since this deposits to the ocean faster than particulate nitrate, we may underestimate the atmospheric N deposition flux. However, the concentrations of nitric acid in the remote marine boundary layer are low and nitric acid deposition is suppressed in the presence of seasalt aerosol, so that the effect of this artifact is unlikely to be large. Samples were generally changed once each day, average air volume sampled ∼1400 m 3 .Aerosol sampling start positions during ANT18-1 grey circles and JCR white circles cruises. Black markers indicate end of sampling. and nitrogen species total soluble N, NO 3 − , NH 4 + analysis are described elsewhere. Soluble phosphorus was determined spectrophotometrically after extraction in ultrapure water buffered at pH 7, as preliminary experiments indicated that the fraction of phosphate extracted was pH dependent and the extraction pH varied in unbuffered samples. Aerosol Fe and P are only sparingly soluble in seawater, so that only a small fraction of their total aerosol inputs are bioavailable. Their relative solubilities estimated using the methods above will be discussed elsewhere. Our estimates of soluble and excess Fe deposition and nitrogen fixation potential below are therefore upper limits.. Deposition velocities are poorly constrained and dependent on particle diameter, so that our flux estimates have an inherent uncertainty of around a factor of 3 error bars in Figure 2 indicate analytical uncertainty for each component . In order to estimate deposition fluxes for N and P during ANT18-1 where size-segregated data were not available, the distributions of NO 3 − and PO 4 3− between the coarse and fine aerosol fractions were estimated to be 85% coarse NO 3 − and 40% coarse PO 4 3− , using our results from the JCR cruise and those of other workers. Again using our results from the JCR cruise, nitrate comprises only ∼40% of total soluble N concentrations in aerosol, but contributes ∼80% to the total dry N deposition because it occurs primarily on the coarse mode aerosol, while NH 4 + and organic N are associated with fine mode aerosol which deposits much more slowly. We have therefore assumed that NO 3 − deposition for ANT18-1 Figure 2 represents 80% of the total N deposition during that cruise and have multiplied the ANT18-1 NO 3 − data by 1.25 to calculate N:P and N:Fe Figure 3 . We have calculated the quantity of Fe removed by non-diazotrophic production stimulated by aerosol N input Fe R by: and nitrogen fixation potential N fix by: where N aero and Fe aero are the nitrogen and iron deposition fluxes and Fe/N phyto and Fe/N fixers are the cellular Fe:N ratios of non-diaztrophic phytoplankton and N fixing organisms respectively. The values selected for these ratios are discussed below.Dry deposition fluxes of soluble a Fe, b N and c P along meridional transects of the Atlantic Ocean in 2000 solid symbols and 2001 open symbols . N deposition in 2000 is shown for NO 3 − the only parameter available , for 2001 total soluble N deposition is shown. Note split scale of x-axis in a .Nutrient ratios in dry aerosol deposition; a N:Fe, b N:P and c P:Fe. Solid symbols 2000, open symbols 2001. Dashed lines indicate Redfieldian nutrient ratios.. In 2001 the soluble Fe inputs associated with the Saharan plume were much weaker than in 2000 reflecting the highly episodic nature of dust transportation events. Aerosol N deposition was generally higher in the relatively polluted northern hemisphere, with low deposition rates observed in the remote South Atlantic. In the South Atlantic, relatively high deposition rates of Fe, N NO 3 − and P were associated with air mass arrivals from southern Africa at ∼10°S. Soluble P deposition was highest in the tropics and just offshore of South America 31°–35°S . that can be directly attributed to the aerosol nutrient input and exclude new production driven exclusively by nutrients from other sources e.g., upwelling . Aerosol N inputs will be utilised by all primary producers, including N 2 fixing species, so that one effect of atmospheric N inputs may be to suppress apparent N 2 fixation rates. The amount of new production supported solely by aerosol nutrient input is dependent on the component having the lowest concentration with respect to Redfield ratios. In all cases this was P, as the aerosol input N:P was considerably higher than the Redfield value of 16 Figure 3b . Once the aerosol P input is consumed, further aerosol-stimulated primary production may occur if sufficient P is present in the water column. In most of the samples this further production would result in the complete removal of the aerosol N input, so that ultimately some fraction of the original soluble Fe input remains in excess. The extent of Fe removal will be dependent on the cellular Fe:N quota of algal growth equation 1 . This quota lies in the range 13–86 μmol mol −1 depending on the Fe status of the water column. The upper end of this range corresponds to Fe replete waters, and we have used 86 μmol mol −1 in our calculations since dissolved Fe concentrations in the water column along our transects are unlikely to limit primary production. In most cases the fraction of aerosol Fe input removed through aerosol N-stimulated growth Fe R /Fe aero was less than 20%. However in a few instances Figure 4a with low Fe inputs and relatively high N inputs, this fraction exceeded 80% and the excess atmospheric Fe input was essentially zero. It is interesting to note that although Saharan input in 2000 is the dominant feature of aerosol Fe deposition along our transects, the influence of this Saharan dust input on N:Fe ratio is rather small when compared to meridional variations in N:Fe. a Percentage of soluble aerosol Fe deposition removed by primary production stimulated by aerosol N deposition and b nitrogen fixation potential calculated from dry aerosol input of excess soluble Fe. Solid symbols 2000, open symbols 2001. Note split scale of x-axis in b .. We have calculated the maximum potential N 2 fixation N fix , equation 2 arising from the observed atmospheric deposition within the latitude range 40°N–40°S Figure 4b by assuming that all of the excess atmospheric input of soluble Fe is available to N 2 fixers and using the cellular Fe:C and C:N ratios reported for Trichodesmium sp. as an example N 2 fixing organism. The highest N fix values were obtained for the more intense Saharan dust deposition event of 2000, with values up to ∼180 μmol N m −2 d −1 - comparable to N 2 fixation rates observed in tropical waters. N fix values were much lower in the southern hemisphere <10 μmol N m −2 d −1 and were lower than the observed atmospheric N deposition fluxes Figure 2b , implying that N 2 fixation makes only a small contribution to external nitrogen supply outside of the areas affected by the Saharan dust plume. There is currently some debate about the Fe requirement of marine diazotrophs, and much lower Fe:C values have been proposed by other workers. Although use of these Fe:C values in our calculation leads to much higher values of N fix , the implied N 2 fixation rates in the southern hemisphere only become comparable to, but do not significantly exceed, the rate of N input directly from the atmosphere. While diazotrophs provide a means to overcome water column N-limitation, eventually available P will become exhausted. We note that the influence of aerosol input on water column nutrient status will be to drive the water column towards short-term P limitation because utilisation of the aerosol N and Fe components both tend to deplete water column P. These results illustrate that evaluating the impact of atmospheric deposition of Fe on marine productivity cannot be done without consideration of the relative inputs of the other key nutrients N and P."
254,particles,"The effects of non-sphericity on geostationary satellite retrievals of dust aerosols. Using data collected during the Puerto Rico Dust Experiment PRIDE , we examine the effect of non-spherical phase functions on dust aerosol retrievals from geostationary satellites. We utilize a statistical model based on Scanning Electron Micrograph SEM analysis of individual dust particles. Using T-matrix calculations and assuming that dust particles are randomly-orientated oblate spheroids we compute the dust phase function and scattering properties. Although the non-spherical function developed in this study compares well with the synthetic non-spherical phase functions [Liu et al., 2003], new retrievals using the non-spherical phase function only show slight improvement at scattering angles Theta from 110degrees similar to 150degrees, and become worse for Theta between 150degrees similar to 170degrees. However the retrievals are greatly improved at all angles when retrieval algorithms account for the combined effect of both spherical and non-spherical phase functions. . The accuracy of satellite aerosol retrievals is affected by many factors including the proper characterization of aerosol phase functions. Although most aerosol species in the atmosphere appear reasonably spherical e.g., smoke or sulfate , and their phase functions can be calculated from Lorenz-Mie theory, non-spherical dust particles pose greater challenges. For the same effective diameter, non-spherical and spherical particles have very different phase functions, especially at scattering angles Θ from 90° to 180°. With the exception of the Multi-angle Spectroradiometer MISR aerosol retrieval algorithms where dust particles are assumed to be randomly-oriented spheroids, most satellite methods use spherical phase functions, that could result in errors during the retrieval of dust aerosol optical thickness AOT, τ ., and recent retrieval techniques where the non-spherical phase function is inferred by finding the best match between calculated and measured sky radiances from the Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET observations. Several studies have showed that a general agreement between modeled and measured phase functions might be reached in some but not in all cases even when the complex refractive index, size distribution and the particle shape are properly defined. However, the samples collected in these laboratory studies were mainly from the surface of deserts and may not represent real aerosols in the atmosphere thousands of kilometers downwind of source regions. Due to lack of  The satellite aerosol retrieval process usually consists of at least two steps. The first step is to model the aerosol optical properties and the second step is to use these properties in a radiative transfer model to create LUTs where the top of atmosphere TOA reflectance is calculated as a function of Sun-satellite geometries, surface reflectance ρ sfc and AOT τ . For a cloud-free pixel, the AOT is retrieved by searching the LUT to find the best match between satellite and calculated reflectance values. . The statistical model uses a total of 6 size intervals ranging from about 0.1 μm to more than 10 μm and 15 aspect ratios from 1.2 to 10 to describe the size and shape of dust particles. For each size interval, the percentage of particles with different aspect ratios is given. To apply this morphology into T-matrix calculations, we assume that dust particles are oblate spheroids. The size distribution of particles measured from the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer APS and the Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer covers the size ranging from 0.01 ∼ 15 μm in diameter Figure 1b , inset , and represents one of the most reliable size distribution datasets in PRIDE. Using T-matrix, the scattering/absorption cross sections σ sca /σ abs and phase functions P Θ of the particles for each aspect ratio and each size bin were first calculated, and then integrated over the daily measured size distributions to calculate the daily bulk aerosol properties., indicating minor differences <3% for σ sca , σ abs and ω between T-Matrix and Mie calculated values but large differences for phase function Figure 1b at 90° < Θ < 150° non-spherical ≫ spherical and 150° < Θ < 180° spherical ≫ non-spherical . Also shown in Figure 1b is an independent synthetic phase function derived from both observations. Due to the limitations of measurement techniques, the phase function cannot be fully measured at the forward and back scattering angles. In Figure 1b , the values of the synthetic phase function between 5° ∼ 173° are laboratory-measured averaged phase function for polydisperse, randomly-oriented mineral dust aerosols, while values at other scattering angles are inferred from T-matrix calculations by forcing the normalization of measured phase function. It is interesting to find that our model-calculated phase function using SEM data during PRIDE is in general agreement with the phase functions reported by . To quantify the effect of the phase function on the systematic retrieval errors in these two angle ranges, the mean relative errors , where ε = τ GOES8 − τ SP /τ SP ; absolute errors , where ∣ε∣ = ∣τ GOES8 − τ SP ∣/τ SP ; and their ratio γ = in these two scattering ranges are listed in Table 1 . Also listed in Table 1 are the and for all angles. The ratio γ provides a simple and efficient way to evaluate the change of systematic errors in different Θ ranges. Usually, the smaller the ∣γ∣ values, the smaller are the systematic errors. When γ = 0, the errors are totally random; γ = 1 implies that the AOTs are systematically overestimated, and γ = −1 indicates AOTs are systematically underestimated. and are in percentage ratios . Several studies have also showed that the difference between spherical and non-spherical phase functions for 110° < Θ < 170° depends upon particle irregularity. In our calculations thus far, we have assumed that all aerosols are non-spherical and did not consider any spherical particles such as wet sea salt and accumulation mode of sulfate particles that were actually included in the size distribution measurements and contribute to the column AOTs in the real atmosphere. To examine the combined effect of spherical and non-spherical particles, the ratio of number concentration between spherical and non-spherical particles must be known a priori that is difficult to obtain. Satellite retrievals have noted that spherical phase function is suitable for background dust-free aerosol retrievals over oceans. Therefore, the AERONET AOT in dust-free and dusty conditions provides a useful reference to estimate the optical contributions from spherical and non-spherical particles. The AOT is about 0.1 in dust-free conditions and increases to about 0.3 in dusty conditions. The ω, σ sca and σ abs have little difference between spherical and non-spherical particles. Therefore, we generate the new non-spherical phase function by compositing the spherical and non-spherical phase functions in a ratio of 1:2 i.e., P Θ composite = 1/3 P Θ spherical + 2/3 × P Θ non-spherical . Compared to retrievals using only spherical Figure 1a or non-spherical phase functions Figure 1b , Figure 1d shows that the composite phase function produces much less systematic errors ∣γ∣ decreases about 50% compared to Figure 1a for 110° < Θ < 150° and 150° < Θ < 170° and overall improvement for all angles Table 1 , decreases from 18% in Figure 1a to 14% in Figure 1d , and no distinct error pattern as a function of Θ .. For instance, the TOA reflectance errors due to sensor calibration and surface reflectance uncertainties could have the same sign and magnitude thus reducing the retrieval errors or act in opposite direction thereby magnifying the errors. Usually, for a specific pixel, it is hard to separate the retrieval errors due to sensor calibrations and the errors due to surface reflectance uncertainties. However, sensitivity studies showed that on the average, those uncertainties are about 10 ∼ 15% with possible maximum of up to 20% i.e., ∣Δτ∣ < 0.07 for mean τ SP of 0.33 . This is smaller in magnitude when compared to the effect of using appropriate phase functions for dust aerosol retrievals. Since the real atmosphere has both spherical and non-spherical particles, using composite phase functions is more reasonable, and produces the best retrievals with the least systematic errors as a function of Θ as shown in this study. Since dust aerosols are larger when compared to sulfate and smoke aerosols, the ratio of the effective radius between fine and coarse mode or the Ångström exponent can provide some information on the relative abundance of spherical and non-spherical particles. However, it is difficult to distinguish spherical and non-spherical particles with similar sizes such as dust non-spherical and wet spherical sea salt particle over most of the globe. From this perspective, this study underscores the difficulties in using a simple and reliable method to perform necessary corrections for the retrievals of the non-spherical particles in current satellite retrieval algorithms.. needs to be further explored. Further studies using Meteosat Second Generation MSG satellite and calculation of the phase function of sharp-edge particles are ongoing. and to apply them in satellite retrievals."
255,aerosol,"Sources of Asian dust and role of climate change versus desertification in Asian dust emission. Simulations of Asian dust emissions over the past 43 years are presented based on a size-dependent soil dust emission and transport model NARCM along with supporting data from a network of surface stations. The deserts in Mongolia and in western and northern China mainly the Taklimakan and Badain Juran, respectively contribute similar to70% of the total dust emissions; non-Chinese sources account for similar to40% of this. Several areas, especially the Onqin Daga sandy land, Horqin sandy land, and Mu Us Desert, have increased in dust emissions over the past 20 years, but efforts to reduce desertification in these areas may have little effect on Asian dust emission amount because these are not key sources. The model simulations indicate that meteorology and climate have had a greater influence on the Asian dust emissions and associated Asian dust storm occurrences than desertification. , possibly even influencing the global carbon cycle, and having a significant effects on regional radiative balances. A geochemically significant quantity of Asian dust, estimated to be 400–500 Tg, is deposited in the North Pacific each year. Approximately 240 Tg of the dust is re-deposited in Chinese deserts each year, 140 Tg falls out over other parts of China, and the dust can also transport from Gobi desert as far as Europe, showing the global nature of these effects. to un-significant values. Soil dust from Asia is at times a major component of the tropospheric aerosol in mid-latitude regions, and while the expansion of deserts caused by human activities can increase dust fluxes Figure 1 , the magnitude of this effect is not well constrained.Chinese desert distributions during 1960s to 70s and desert plus desertification areas during 1980s and 90s.. The visibility-based approach is only semi-quantitative indicator, however, because the frequencies of dust storms do not necessarily capture the strength of dust storms. That is, beyond the threshold criteria for reporting an event, the quantities of dust raised vary from storm-to-storm, and a region with less frequent but more severe dust storms may be a stronger source than areas with more frequent but weaker ones. Observer bias is an intrinsic limitation of the visibility approach. Furthermore, there is not necessarily a direct correspondence between dust storm frequencies and dust sources because dust transported into the region-as opposed to newly raised dust-also can reduce visibility.. These numerical methods are crucially dependent on parameterizations of dust deflation, and as such require accurate information on the geographical distributions of the deserts, their surface roughness elements, grain size, soil moisture, etc.. Validation of model simulations is a key issue in these studies.. The model was driven by the NCEP re-analyzed meteorology, and was run on a polar stereographic projection with a horizontal resolution of 100 × 100 km and 22 vertical levels on a Gal-Chen terrain-following coordinate system from the ground to 30 km. The model is restricted to the suspension of particles <40 μm because they are most readily transported by turbulent eddies and advection. Twelve dust particle-size classes from diameters of 0.01 to 41 μm were used to represent the size distribution of soil dust. The dust fluxes and concentrations were calculated for each size bin. The model domain covered East Asia, the North Pacific and western North America.. Surface observations of the size-distribution of dust aerosol during local dust storm conditions at nine Chinese desert regions were used to constrain the size distribution of vertical dust flux. Information taken from Chinese desert maps from 1960s to 70s was used to generate the distribution of deserts, gobi, sandy lands, loess and other land types prior to 1980. This information was mainly obtained from the aviation images and surveys conducted from the 1950s to the 70s. In contrast, the maps of desert and expanded deserts and sand areas for the 1980s to 1990s, were mainly based on surveys and satellite images see Figure 1 . Dust from S1 including deserts and sands in Kazakhstan , S5 containing the desert in Tsaidam Basin and the Kumutage Desert , S7 mainly composing Mu Us Desert and Hobq Desert , Onqin Daga sandy land S8 and Horqin sandy land S9 , each contribute 4% to 7% of the total emission Figure 2 . Minor contributions can also be found from S3 including Gurbantunggut Desert, 0.5% and source areas in south of the Tibetan Plateau S10, 2% . The historical dust depositional areas D1 and D2 and some sandy coastal areas also eject small amounts of the dust. After a trend of increasing Asian dust emissions from 1961 to 1963, followed by a low emission period from 1964 to 1967, the model simulations indicate that amount of dust produced generally decreased after 1969. Note that the simulated dust fluxes often switch from high to low emission after intervals of 3 to 4 yr Figure 3a . It is also noteworthy that no abrupt change in the pattern of emissions was observed in 1979 to 1981 which is when the data inputs to the model changed. The most recent simulations showed dust emission began a two-year rise from 2000 to 2001, reaching the highest of the 43-yrs in 2001 then dropped again in 2002. The average springtime dust emission for particles less than 40 μm diameter from 1960 to 1979 ∼1.2 × 10 11 kg was ∼24% higher than during 1980 to 1999 ∼0.97 × 10 11 kg . According to our model simulations, the dominant meteorological factors that control the dust emission flux are surface wind speed and precipitation. The later controls the soil moisture contents. to 7% in average Figure 1 , and if desertification were the predominant influence on dust production, the emissions and dust storm reports would have followed an increasing trend, and the averaged emission during 1980 to 1999 would have had a higher value than that during 1960 to 1979. The large increase in dust and sand storms over the past three years Figure 3 is more logically explained by changes in weather and climate than desertification because the land area affected by desertification changes relatively little over a few years time. Thus two lines of evidence indicate that meteorological factors and climate change have been more important than desertification with respect to a decreasing occurrence of the Asian dust storms. On the basis of the NARCM model simulations the sources in Mongolia S2 , Taklimakan S4 and Badain Jaran S6 produce 29%, 21% and 22% of the Asian dust, respectively. Five sources, including those in Kazakhstan S1 , the desert in the Qaidam Basin and Kumutage Desert S5 , Mu Us Desert S7 , Onqin Daga sandy land S8 , and the Horqin sandy land S9 each produce few percent of the dust. The regions south of Tibet S10 and the Gurbantunggut Desert S3 are minor sources, combining for less than 3% of the dust production.[15]  Changes in the amounts of Asian dust and associated dust storm occurrences over the past few decades apparently are driven mainly by weather and climate, but the simulations do show some impact of dust originating from some desertified areas. Therefore there is the potential for ecological measures and changes in land use practices to reduce dust emissions and the occurrence of dust storms. Unfortunately, the “anthropogenic sources” including those mainly from the Onqin Daga sandy land S8 , Horqin sandy land S9 , Mu Us Desert S7 , even the deserts in the Qaidam basin and the Kumutage Desert S5 , which have been the targets of dust control measures, are not major dust producers. Nevertheless, it is also possible that some desertified regions, in particular areas with 200–400 mm of annual precipitation, could resume their original appearance as arid steppes. As for the possible transport influence of dust on China's big cities after, a detailed study is under way to include the development of measures to rehabilitate of some desertified lands.[16]  Numerous questions remain concerning dust fluxes that can be evaluated using approaches similar to those used here; these questions include: What's the critical climatic index for dust emission? What's kind of mechanism of climate impact on the dust emission and transport? What changes in climate, especially in 1970s and 1990s and in the last three years were responsible for the changes in dust emissions? All these topics should be addressed in future studies."
256,dust clouds ocean,"Longwave radiative forcing of Saharan dust aerosols estimated from MODIS, MISR, and CERES observations on Terra. Using observations from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer MISR , the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS , and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System CERES instruments onboard the Terra satellite; we present a new technique for studying longwave LW radiative forcing of dust aerosols over the Saharan desert for cloud-free conditions. The monthly-mean LW forcing for September 2000 is 7 Wm -2 and the LW forcing efficiency LWeff is 15 Wm -2 per unit aerosol optical depth. Using radiative transfer calculations, we show that simultaneous measurements of the vertical distribution of aerosols, surface temperature and water vapor are critical to the understanding of dust LW aerosol forcing, and must come from other sources. Using well calibrated, spatially and temporally collocated data sets, we have combined the strengths of three sensors from the same satellite to quantify the LW forcing, and show that dust aerosols have a ""warming'' effect over the Saharan desert that will counteract the shortwave ""cooling effect'' of other aerosols. . Widely prevalent in the tropics, dust aerosols are effective in reflecting solar energy back to space thereby “cooling” the earth's surface. Besides their radiative impact in the shortwave portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum, dust aerosols also have an important radiative effect in the longwave LW . Having mean particle sizes on the order of several micrometers, dust aerosols can effectively reduce the earth's LW emission by re-emitting at a colder temperature when compared to the surface and thereby “warming” the earth. However, numerical simulations of dust LW forcing remain a challenging task because of the high spatio-temporal variation of dust properties.. Since the ERBE instruments were not designed to detect aerosols, narrowband satellite observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer AVHRR and the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer TOMS were used to identify the presence of dust plumes within the large ERBE scanner footprints. Although the AVHRR and the ERBE scanner were on the same satellite e.g., NOAA-9 , accurate detection of dust aerosols over bright targets such as the Saharan desert was not possible due to the limitations of the AVHRR. The TOMS aerosol index which is the difference in aerosol absorptivity between two UV channels has been used to detect dust aerosols over bright targets such as deserts, but the technique is insensitive to dust layers at low altitudes and since the TOMS and ERBE instruments were not on the same satellite, precise temporal collocation was not possible.. One of the primary roles of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS and the Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer MISR is to detect aerosols and retrieve their properties. The MODIS with 36 channels has improved spectral, spatial and radiometric resolutions when compared with previous imagers and has been used to retrieve aerosol properties over the global oceans and over land areas with low surface reflectances. The MISR with multi-angle measurements and four spectral channels has also been used to identify aerosols and retrieve aerosol properties over the global oceans and land including bright targets such as deserts. In this study, we combine the strengths of three instruments on the Terra satellite to examine cloud-free longwave dust aerosol forcing. We use the MODIS to identify clouds because of its multi-spectral capabilities and higher spatial resolution when compared to MISR and CERES. Although the MODIS provides aerosol properties over the global oceans, aerosol retrievals over highly-reflective surfaces such as deserts are not available. Therefore we use the multi-angle capabilities of the MISR instrument to obtain aerosol optical depth. Finally we use the CERES to obtain broadband TOA longwave fluxes.; the 5 km MODIS Level 2 daily MOD06 cloud product and the 30 km nadir view pixel level CERES data. The MISR aerosol product contains aerosol optical thickness and other related properties at 0.558 μm. The expected uncertainties in MISR aerosol retrievals are ±0.05 for aerosol optical thickness τ 0.55 less than 0.5, and ±10% for τ 0.55 greater that 0.5. Recently, . Spatial collocation is performed using point spread functions of the CERES scanner.. To eliminate these cloud effects, the MOD06 cloud product is collocated with the CERES data and only those CERES pixels that are at least 99.9% cloud free as identified by the MOD06 data were used. Although the MOD06 cloud fraction is aggregated from the 1 km cloud-screening data product using a total of 19 visible and infrared channels, it is possible that thick dust plumes could be misclassified as clouds. For these cloud-free CERES pixels, the best-fit aerosol optical thickness τ 0.55 from the MISR data is obtained. As noted in  In this paper, we have demonstrated a new technique for estimating the dust aerosol LW direct forcing over the Saharan desert. Through the synergistic use of MODIS, MISR and CERES instruments onboard the same satellite, our study clearly shows that there is a strong dust warming effect of 7 Wm −2 over the cloud free Sahara desert regions for September 2000 that can offset the shortwave cooling effect of other aerosols. The regional mean dust LW direct forcing efficiency is 15 Wm −2 per τ 0.55 . However, since water vapor dominates the radiative processes in the longwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum, simultaneous measurements of both aerosol height and column water vapor are needed to reduce the uncertainties in the longwave radiative forcing calculations of dust aerosols."
257,dust,"Elemental composition determined by PIXE analysis of the insoluble aerosol particles in EPICA-Dome C ice core samples representing the last 27000 years. 107 samples from the first 581 m of the EPICA ice core, Dome C, East Antarctica, representing a 27000 year record, were analysed by the PIXE technique. The concentrations of several elements Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe were determined in the insoluble particles, collected by filtration from the melted ice samples. The average elemental ratios for Holocene and LGM are in agreement with continental crust values. The element depositional fluxes, evaluated from PIXE concentration data by means of the EPICA ice accumulation rate, are smaller in the Holocene than during Glacial times, confirming the differences in dust loads in the atmosphere during the contrasting climatic conditions. In Holocene, the fraction of the insoluble particle mass estimated as the sum of the measured element oxides agrees well with the total dust mass as determined from Coulter Counter measurements, but during the LGM the particle counting shows a larger dust mass.  for successive analyses by Particle Induced X-Ray Emission PIXE .. were performed at the National Laboratories of Legnaro Padua, Italy , using a proton beam accelerated to 1.8 MeV by the AN 2000 Van de Graaff accelerator, with experimental set up and measurement conditions described by , with measurement errors from 5% to 10%, depending on the element. The error is higher when the mass of material is close to the detection limit and therefore the concentrations of P, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Br and Zn, determined at trace level, are not presented. The insoluble particle number concentration Figure 1f and the particle mass records used in this work were determined from the Coulter Counter Multisizer IIe particle volume record. The instrument was set for measurements of particles with diameters from 0.7 to 20 μm.Profiles of element concentrations ng cm −3 , or ppb a–e , of deuterium δD ‰ f and of particle number concentration N cm −3 plotted versus age years before present . The chronology of the core was established by  The trends of the measured element concentrations ng cm −3 versus time are shown in Figures 1a–1e . The K concentrations Figure 1b are in agreement with the data given by Hinkley and Matsumoto . The difference between total and fine Vostok concentration profiles provides an estimation of the concentration profiles in coarse i.e., >0.4 μm particles. These indirectly-evaluated Vostok concentration profiles may be compared with the concentrations of insoluble particles >0.4 μm reported in the present work section 2 . For Al and K our concentration values are similar to those of the Vostok data, and our Mg concentrations, whose average value in LGM is less than 4 ppb, are of the same order of magnitude as the Vostok core. The comparison is less reliable for Ca, which is enriched in the soluble fraction. Nevertheless, in the Vostok core the mass ratio of the fine <0.4 μm to the total Ca varies from 0.7 and 0.9, and the Ca PIXE data particles >0.4 μm are comparable to the 10–20 percent of the total Ca from the Vostok core.. The comparison clearly indicates large differences in absolute concentration: EPICA nss-Ca 2+ , taken as a proxy for continental dust, ranges from ∼50 ppb during the glacial age to ∼2 ppb during the Holocene, whereas our values range from ∼3 ppb to ∼0.1 ppb respectively. Nevertheless, the agreement between the LGM/Holocene concentration ratio ∼25 from nss-Ca 2+ data and from our data ∼30 is good. Fine particle weathering or dissolution may cause the estimation of Ca concentrations from PIXE analysis to be too low. However, the large difference between the Ca concentrations in the insoluble particles, measured directly by PIXE, and the values calculated from nss-Ca 2+ , indicates that a large fraction of the Ca in continental dust is soluble. This is not surprising, and is in agreement with other studies about the GRIP ice core., and the concentrations of soluble and insoluble S are not correlated. Insoluble S probably represents atmospheric sulphur of terrestrial origin. Our average insoluble S concentration is 0.2 ppb in Holocene and 0.3 ppb in LGM, being more abundant during cold periods when accumulation rates are low. Similarly, average insoluble Cl concentrations are 0.1 ppb and 0.3 ppb in the Holocene and LGM, respectively. The occurrence in the continental surface of possible sources of insoluble Cl mainly apatite is very low. Our estimation of Cl is probably too high respect to the insoluble Cl provided from these sources. On the other hand, at under-ppb concentration level the PIXE measurement error may be higher.. Our S/Cl values are close to crustal values. For Al, Fe, Si, Ti and K, relevant constituents of the crustal minerals which are more abundant in insoluble particulate aerosol than in marine materials, the agreement with continental crust ratios is not surprising. Nevertheless, the uncertainties associated to our elemental ratios are high.Wedepohl  We also evaluate the correlation matrix of the following three parameters: element concentrations, deuterium, and insoluble particle number N cm −3 . Deuterium is highly anti-correlated with the particle number corr. coeff. −0.86 Figure 1f , and with Si −0.76 , K −0.77 and Fe − 0.77 profiles.. The snow accumulation rate in the LGM 1.5 g cm −2 y −1 is two times that of the Holocene value 2.7 g cm −2 y −1 . Our sampling time frequency along the EPICA core is variable, with mean values of 227 years for Holocene and 299 for LGM.Average values of zero result from element concentrations close to the detection limits. from the Law Dome East Antarctica coastal site ice core ∼6–19 . It is interesting to note that the ratios of Ca fluxes of the LGM and the Holocene, whether evaluated by means of nss-Ca 2+ or by the method of the present study are about the same ∼12 and ∼12.9, respectively , assuming snow accumulation rate during the glacial period of about the half that of Holocene. from the insoluble particle volume, assuming an average particle density of 2.5 g cm −3 , was compared for the 107 samples examined in this work with the concentrations of the particle mass fraction M ox , calculated as the sum of the masses of the oxides of the insoluble elements Na 2 O, MgO, Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , SO 2 , K 2 O, CaO, TiO, MnO, Fe 2 O 3 detected by PIXE per cm 3 of melted sample. These oxides are the major constituents of the continental crust. Most carbonate and sulphate-containing particles are very soluble, so we did not take them into account. in the Holocene is 15 ±7 ng cm −3 and does not differ strongly from the M ox mean value of 16 ± 11 ng cm −3 . In the Glacial period, the average values are 790 ±290 ng cm −3 for M d and 368 ±204 ng cm −3 for M ox . M d was obtained from particle counting measuring all particles larger than 0.7 μm see section 2 . , whereas M ox was calculated from PIXE analysis summed oxides of the particles larger than 0.4 μm. The implication may be that during glacial time the large dust mass M d is due to the presence of abundant particles larger than 0.7 μm whose constituents are not detected by PIXE, such as carbonaceous particles. It may suggest different sources for the atmospheric dust in the glacial period respect to Holocene.[31]  An indication of the presence of insoluble constituents in the core, not detectable by PIXE, may be provided from SEM-EDAX analysis of EPICA samples: four Holocene and four LGM samples were analysed by SEM-EDAX. Given the very low number of particles in the samples mainly in the Holocene ones , any quantitative estimation results are not significant. The investigation would require the availability of more numerous and larger volume samples.[32]  Given the numerous sources of uncertainties, the difference between M d and M ox might be partly expected. Nevertheless, this difference is not yet fully understood: adequate SEM-EDAX analyses would allow us to investigate the hypothesis of different dust sources for Holocene and LGM.[33]  The examination of 107 samples from the EPICA ice core, covering the last 27000 years, provides the concentration profiles for a group of elements detected by PIXE in the insoluble particles.[34]  The element concentrations agree satisfactorily with literature data. Correlations and average element ratios indicate the dominantly crustal origin of the elements measured Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe . Different source areas and differences in uptake and transport efficiency of different particles of differing mineral identity, size, density, and habit may explain the variability in elemental proportions and abundances through the core profile.[35]  Fluxes are greater in the Glacial time than in the Holocene, confirming long-held assumptions of dust enrichment in atmosphere in the last Glacial period, related to the higher continental aridity. Elemental analysis by PIXE and particle counting by Coulter Counter both confirm this relation.[36]  For the Holocene, sums of elemental oxides from PIXE analysis of particles filtered from ice agree well with the dust mass concentration record obtained from particle counting measurements. In contrast, the agreement is less good for the time of the Last Glacial Maximum. In future work, SEM-EDAX analyses must be coupled to PIXE to perform a complete study of the dust mineralogy, in order to investigate the differences of the atmospheric dust composition in the Holocene and the LGM.[37]  Finally, PIXE technique is a promising tool for measuring element concentrations in insoluble atmospheric particles. PIXE provides direct measurements of element concentrations in dust particles, with high sensitivity. Furthermore, the multi-element capability of PIXE analysis allows the simultaneous and rapid determination of multiple elements in a single analytical run. The possibility of measuring the concentration of Si, a crustal reference element not determined by others in the insoluble dust particles from the EPICA ice core, represents a further advantage of the present application of PIXE technique."
258,dust climate aerosol ocean,"An ice core indicator of Antarctic sea ice production?. [1] The sea ice surface, not open water, is the dominant source of sea salt to aerosol and ice cores in coastal Antarctica. Here, we show that it may also form the dominant source for central Antarctica. We can then explain higher concentrations in the winter and last glacial maximum LGM as being due to increased sea ice production. This suggests that ice core sea salt can indicate at least the timing of changes in Antarctic sea ice production. The pattern of sea salt in ice cores is consistent with marine evidence about sea ice changes in the Holocene and LGM. Sea salt shows no change at the initial CO2 increase out of the last glacial, making it unlikely this was primarily due to changing sea ice cover. The sea salt record should not be treated as an indicator of meridional transport. . Sea ice production leads to Antarctic bottom water formation; some authors believe that this effect is a dominant influence on the strength of glacial thermohaline circulation. To understand and model Quaternary climate we must therefore obtain good records of changes in sea ice production and extent.. From a network of sites, a picture of past sea ice extent may be established. The most promising proxy for sea ice from ice cores has been methanesulfonic acid MSA , derived from marine biogenic emissions. It has been suggested that the concentration of MSA in coastal ice cores depends on the sea ice extent of the previous winter, and can be used as a record of sea ice extent over recent decades. However, a good indicator of sea ice conditions over longer time periods is still needed., and were considerably higher in the LGM.. However, the spatial distribution of sea salt in snow when going inland from the coast, or across a flat ice shelf, suggest that the depletion in sea salt load across 1000 km of source-free sea ice typical for winter Figure 1 would be a factor 20.Map of Antarctica showing sites mentioned in the text, and the present-day sea ice extent February and August averages for 1978–1997 .. Meridional transport to central Antarctica from mid-latitudes is strongest in winter, but the seasonality is already very modest for tracers from Patagonian latitudes; from the sea ice zone, the seasonality should be even smaller. In summary, there is little evidence that these factors can overcome the large reduction due to the increased distance to open water.Monthly mean wind speeds for Signy Island 60°43′S, 45°36′W , averaged over 1956–1995 data from http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/data.html .. Newly formed sea ice is covered in a highly saline brine and, in many cases, by fragile and equally salty frost flower crystals. These form a very effective source of sea salt in winter. Because mirabilite sodium sulfate decahydrate starts to precipitate below -8°C, the aerosol formed from them is strongly depleted in sulfate, which explains the frequent observations at near-coastal sites of negative non-sea-salt nss SO 4 2- in both aerosol and snow confirm that air masses coming from fresh sea ice covered in frost flowers have high salt concentrations and negative nss SO 4 2- . These episodes dominate the sea salt budget in coastal regions. Strong negative nss SO 4 2- , diagnostic of an important sea ice surface source, has been observed in ice cores at sites some distance inland on the Ronne Ice Shelf, at Berkner Island, and at Siple Dome.. A likely explanation is that the sea salt aerosol is depleted in nss SO 4 2- at source. Analysis of one major salt event supports this; the weight ratio in the increase of SO 4 2- to that of Na is 0.11, similar to that in frost flowers, rather than 0.25 as in sea water. 2 . It is difficult to explain why a sea ice source is important for near-coast sites but that a lower latitude open water source is more important inland. 3 . The winter peak argues against an open water source, but is consistent with a sea ice source. 4 . Similarly it seems unlikely that the open water source would be enhanced under glacial conditions. Measurements of the size distribution of dust in Antarctic snow suggest that the meridional transport to Antarctica was not significantly greater at the LGM than the present, a view confirmed by aerosol transport models. In one recent experiment, the modelled LGM concentration of sea salt at Vostok from an open water source alone was half that of the present-day. This implies flux reduced by a factor 4, compared to an observed doubling. suggests that this effect is small, both between winter and summer, and between present and LGM; 4 . the amount that is lost by deposition during transport. Further work is needed to establish the importance of these factors, but at least for the Holocene, we expect them to be secondary to changes in the amount of sea ice production. Because of the very episodic nature of transport from a brine production area to an ice core site, it is unlikely that the proxy will work on an annual basis, but it should give an indication of sea ice production when averaged over decades or centuries., there may have been a significant increase in multi-year ice, loosening the link between production and extent. The extension of the large ice shelves over the continental shelf will have altered the location of some sea ice production. Because sea salt reaches central Antarctica in discrete episodes, with trajectory times from the coast that are only 1–2 days, changes in the overall hydrological cycle should not affect the residence time significantly, but changes in the strength, frequency or location of these episodes could be important. As a result, sea salt in ice cores cannot yet be used quantitatively to indicate sea ice production in the glacial period, but nonetheless any major change in sea ice production should be seen as a simultaneous change in ice core sea salt flux.. Because the snow accumulation rate based on the glaciological and accumulation models used to date the ice core is so low, dry deposition dominates the flux to the snow surface, and it is therefore appropriate to use the Na flux, rather than concentration, as the indicator for sea ice production at these sites.Deuterium content top and Na flux 100-year averages at Dome C, Antarctica for the last 45 kyr. The CO 2 content of the atmosphere across the glacial-Holocene transition line with circles is also shown.. Our new interpretation is that winter sea ice production and probably extent has increased in both the Ross Sea and the wider region that feeds Dome C. Diatom assemblages in the Ross Sea independently suggest that sea ice cover has increased over the last 6 kyr. Na data from Dome Fuji, in the Atlantic sector, suggest a Holocene increase there also. Again, marine evidence already suggests that sea ice in the Weddell Sea expanded around 5 kyr B.P. The ice core and marine evidence strongly suggest that sea ice production and extent have increased widely around Antarctica over the later half of the Holocene., and a similar estimate can be made for Dome Fuji. Previously this was interpreted as being due to a greatly increased meridional transport, offsetting an assumed increase in sea ice extent. Although changes in transport play a role, we conclude instead that the main reason for increased sea salt in the ice cores is that winter sea ice production on both the Indian and Atlantic sides of Antarctica was significantly increased in the LGM. Diatom reconstructions suggest that maximum sea ice extent was between 5 and 10 degrees further north at the LGM than the present, giving approximately double the areal coverage. With this new interpretation, taken together with evidence that increased dust at the LGM was due to changes in South American climate, there is no longer any ice core evidence to support the often cited view that meridional transport to Antarctica was greatly increased at the LGM compared to the present. Model studies have found only limited or no increases in such transport, so our conclusion removes a perceived discrepancy between modelling and observations.. Assuming that a decrease in extent was caused mainly by decreased annual production, we would expect to see a significant change in sea salt. From the detailed CO 2 record Figure 3 of the transition, much of the CO 2 increase was complete before there was any significant change in Na flux, implying that sea ice changes are very unlikely to be responsible for the initial rise from 185 to 240 ppmv, although they could play some role for the final increase to 270 ppmv.[16]  The previous paradigm, that sea salt in Antarctic snow derives from open water, is at odds with the evidence. The sea ice surface provides a plausible alternative source, although it remains difficult to find definitive proof at inland sites. Further high-resolution aerosol analyses of Na and SO 4 2- at inland sites are certainly needed. Process studies in the sea ice zone could establish how we should interpret a sea ice indicator for periods with different climate.[17]  Similar estimates to those we have presented should now be made for cores facing each sector of Antarctica, so that a picture of sea ice production around Antarctica can be built up, with coastal cores providing a more regional view. These should be combined with the site-specific data available from marine cores to provide an integrated picture of sea ice extent at different time periods. Finally, the implications for Greenland sea salt records should also be considered."
259,particles aerosol,"Iron mobilization in mineral dust: Can anthropogenic SO2 emissions affect ocean productivity?. For Fe contained in long-range transported aeolian dust to act as a micronutrient for oceanic phytoplankton it must be first dissolved or mobilized. We propose that Fe-mobilization can occur in mineral dust from East Asia by the incorporation of SO2 into the advecting dust plumes and subsequent acidification of the dust through heterogeneous SO2 oxidation. To test this hypothesis, we consider a dust plume that originated from the gobi-deserts and advected over the Pacific Ocean. Data collected over the Yellow Sea confirm that this plume contained high concentrations of dust and SO2. Significant gaseous HNO3 concentrations indicate that the dust particles were acidified i.e., pH < 2 . At these pH's, 1-2% of the Fe contained in a deliquescent mineral dust particle would be mobilized within 3-5 days. These results suggest a possible link between the rate of C-fixation in so-called High-Nitrate-Low-Chlorophyll regions of the Pacific Ocean and SO2 emissions from East Asia. . One of the major uncertainties in modeling Fe input to the ocean relates to mobilization or dissolution of the Fe contained in mineral dust. While only soluble Fe is bioavailable virtually all the Fe found in sands from arid and semi-arid regions is in a crystalline Fe-III form. This form of Fe is insoluble in high pH solutions such as seawater; thus for phytoplankton to utilize the Fe deposited in mineral dust, some fraction of the Fe must be mobilized during transport in the atmosphere. The magnitude of the dissolved iron fraction DIF in mineral dust is uncertain. Previous estimates of DIF generally range from less than 1% to more than 10% c.f., , 2000 ; , 2003 ]. vol for highlighted portion of Flight 13. and T averaged 288 K. Adopting these values, along with the appropriate temperature dependence for , we get K ∼ 0.15 mole/kg.vol calculated from Equation 6 is plotted as a function of pH. Also shown are the results of a more complete calculation using the thermodynamic model ISORROPIA which accounts for solution non-idealities. While the two calculations differ somewhat, both calculations indicate that a pH of ∼1 is needed to support the observed vol as a function of pH.[15]  Finally, we note that we found several other TRACE-P flight segments DC-8 flights 9 and 16 that are characterized by high dust and SO 2 content. During each of these segments, high values of [NO 3 − ] vol were also inferred, suggesting that the dust was highly acidified in these cases as well.[16]  Analysis of data collected on board the NASA DC-8 aircraft during TRACE-P suggests that anthropogenic SO 2 emissions from China can promote the acid-mobilization of Fe in mineral dust plumes from East Asia. If this limited analysis is generally applicable to dust plumes from East Asia, it would imply that SO 2 emissions from urban and industrial centers of China can lead to the mobilization of Fe in mineral dust. To the extent that this mobilized Fe is then acting as a limiting micronutrient in oceanic ecosystems, air pollution from China would be responsible for enhancing the productivity of these waters. By extension, air pollution controls in China which lowered SO 2 emissions might actually depress C-uptake in these same waters. Further investigations, involving more detailed observations and modeling studies of the interactions between airborne dust and air pollutants are needed to test this hypothesis and determine extent to which the data from TRACE-P are typical of dust plumes emitted from East Asia."
260,aerosol,"A consolidated technique for enhancing desert dust storms with MODIS. A new satellite-based multispectral passive radiometer technique for daytime enhancement of airborne dust over water and land has been developed. The algorithm, which combines color information from multiple visible channels with near and far infrared measurements, provides an improved ability to distinguish areas of dust from water/ice clouds and bright desert backgrounds in enhanced false-color imagery. While generally applicable to any sensor possessing the requisite spectral information, the method is demonstrated here using high spatial and spectral resolution digital data from the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS instruments carried aboard Earth Observing System EOS Terra and Aqua polar orbiter platforms.  Multi-spectral dust enhancement techniques using satellite radiometer measurements in visible/reflective infrared 0.4–1.6 μm , shortwave/near-infrared 2–5 μm , and infrared 8–12 μm channels dominate the subject literature. Other methods exploit spatial contrast reduction effects, which may be limited over spatially invariant desert backgrounds. Still others invoke a general approach based on empirical orthogonal functions from an arbitrarily large collection of spectral measurements in formulating an optimal observation set that ultimately is linked to the underlying physics. These techniques share the common principle of contrasting spectral, spatial, or in the case of geostationary applications, temporal as a basis for distinguishing dust from other constituents of the scene. In spite of this extensive research, relatively little has been attempted in terms of merging techniques and advancing the visualization of the products derived., providing a reduced-ambiguity dust detection capability. Though generally applicable, the method is presented here in the context of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS; e.g., demonstrate methods for enhancing dust using single channel visible over water and infrared imagery over land . The infrared-window roughly 8–12 μm contains additional dust information as examined by technique to over-land applications by combining dust coloration properties with additional infrared techniques as suggested by previous researchers. One of the primary innovations of the current enhancement is its ability to distinguish between dust and most cloud cover through use of multiple visible and reflective infrared channels available from MODIS. Over dark backgrounds such as water apart from areas of sun glint, shallow, or sediment/organic-laden waters , dust is generally easier to detect during the daytime owing to its high reflectivity, and the technique described by  In a second example Figure 2 , collected during the active military phase of OIF, waves of post-frontal dust surge through the Southwest Asia domain. This event was part of a series of major dust impulses associated with the passage of a strong baroclinic system, resulting in a substantial downtime with reduced air support for infantry on the ground in southern Iraq. Improvements to detail and distribution of significant dust areas in comparison to the visible imagery are readily apparent. The dust front crossing Kuwait and entering the Northern Arabian Gulf maintains a similar appearance across the land/sea algorithmic boundary. A field of cumulus clouds on the Iraqi/Saudi border and a band of cirrus over southern Qatar both appear cyan. The lighter cyan of cirrus west of Qatar arises from the over-water algorithm not incorporating the MODIS 1.38 μm channel screen.Dust over Southwest Asia during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Visible channel imagery top fails to unambiguously resolve significant details of dust plumes captured by the enhancement bottom . Ongoing efforts to mitigate some of these limiting factors include geometry-dependent scaling and spectral information, updates to ancillary datasets, and incorporation of numerical weather prediction model fields e.g., for dynamic glint zone specification based on surface winds . The enhancement was produced in near real-time during the OIF conflict and used by DoD and coalition forces for tactical forecast support and munitions selection guidance. It is also being used to identify dust source regions for aerosol model initialization, model validation of dust outbreaks and coverage, and in support of an operational daily dust analysis produced by the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center FNMOC in Monterey, CA.[19]  A new method for identifying dust over water and land backgrounds has been developed for applications to multispectral satellite imagery. Previous methods are combined with new spectral capabilities available from the MODIS sensors aboard EOS Terra and Aqua to enhance dust as shades of pink while clouds/land appear cyan/green. The method is composed of two algorithms over land and water tuned to maintain a similar enhancement of dust crossing coastlines. With minor refinements to digitally mask those areas of enhanced dust based on thresholds within the three-dimensional color space , the technique would appear to be well-suited as a starting point for over-land dust property analyses."
261,dust aerosol,"Factors controlling atmospheric fluxes of Be-7 and Pb-210 in northern Taiwan. [1] Fluxes of Be-7 and Pb-210 were continuously monitored at two sites in northern Taiwan during 1996 - 2001. The time series of both nuclides show seasonality and dependence on precipitation, annual monsoon cycle and episodic events typhoons and Asian dust storms . Besides, anomalously high Be-7 and Pb-210 fluxes occurred in 1998, which are most likely caused by enhanced atmospheric convection in the north Pacific resulting from significantly increased SST in the western Pacific warm pool. . Activities of 7 Be in the atmosphere increase sharply with altitude and have been reported to range from 0.06 to 1.2 dpm m −3 in the troposphere and 10 to 35 dpm m −3 in the stratosphere. The amount of 7 Be that reaches the surface of the earth is controlled by factors or processes including cosmic-ray intensity, wet and dry deposition, vertical transport in the troposphere and horizontal transport from the subtropics and mid-latitudes into the tropics and polar regions. The atmospheric flux of 7 Be observed worldwide in previous studies ranged from ∼6 to ∼40 dpm cm −2 yr −1 .. Therefore, spatial variation of atmospheric 210 Pb concentration or flux is to a large extent controlled by land-sea distribution. . Although such studies are fairly common, the data are still lacking in key areas such as Taiwan and its vicinity. It is important to fill the data gaps to establish a globally comprehensive database. Gamma counting was performed using a well-type HPGe detector EG&G ORTEC GWL-100230 interfaced with a digital γ-ray spectrometer EG&G ORTEC DSPec™ for the determination of 210 Pb and 7 Be. Efficiencies of the detector as functions of sample volume and γ-ray energy have been carefully calibrated using 7 Be BNL S/M 054911 and Harwell uraninite standard solutions. For 1-ml samples, the absolute counting efficiency is 78% for 210 Pb at 46.52 keV and 19% for 7 Be at 477.56 keV . The data reported here have been decay-corrected to the mid-point of sample collection. Fluxes of 7 Be and 210 Pb show strong seasonality, with peaks in the winter and low values in the summer. There are also inter-annual and inter-site variations. For the entire multi-year time series, the mean fluxes of 7 Be and 210 Pb are 6.7 and 1.1 dpm cm −2 yr −1 , respectively, at PCY and are substantially higher at NK 11.0 and 1.9 dpm cm −2 yr −1 for 7 Be and 210 Pb, respectively . There exists a strong correlation between long-term nuclide fluxes and average rainfall at these two sites. More details of the time series are discussed below. Regardless of the distinct difference in source terms of 7 Be and 210 Pb, their fluxes as shown in Figures 2b and 2c correlate well with each other r = 0.89, n = 113, P < 0.001 and fluctuate with wet precipitation. In fact, this is also a common phenomenon elsewhere and suggests that both nuclides are removed from the atmosphere mainly by rainfall. Dust storms can affect the relative flux of 7 Be and 210 Pb in a different way. The primary source regions of Asian dust storms are the Taklimakan desert, the Gobi desert and the Loess Plateau in China. Every spring, dust storms formed in conjunction with the expansion of high-pressure systems over these regions can reach Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The invasion of dust storms into Taiwan each year is clearly reflected in the PM 10 data from Taiwan-EPA's air quality monitoring station at Yang-Ming Shan, which usually happens around March and April Figure 3 . Unlike typhoons, which cause high 7 Be/ 210 Pb ratios in precipitation, dust storms usually result in low 7 Be/ 210 Pb ratios due to their association with 210 Pb-laden continental air masses.. Although our time series is not adequate to address the effect of solar activity on 7 Be, it covers the period i.e., 1997–1998 when the most intense ENSO in the 20th century occurred. This gives us an opportunity to evaluate the effect of ENSO on the flux of fallout nuclides, although it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between ENSO and quasi-biennial oscillation.. This large increase in SST caused large-scale warming and enhanced mixing in the troposphere, and thus more frequent typhoons and higher amounts of precipitation. As discussed earlier, typhoons are responsible for the introduction of relatively higher 7 Be flux and higher 7 Be/ 210 Pb ratio.13-month moving average derived for the attributes in Figure 2 to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight inter-annual oscillations. In conclusion, Taiwan is situated in a sensitive location where the interplay of various meteorological factors and processes could be deciphered using 7 Be and 210 Pb as aerosol tracers. In this study, we have shown that the time series of 7 Be and 210 Pb fluxes and their relative magnitudes at two contrasting sites can be interpreted by atmospheric transport and precipitation associated with monsoons, typhoons and dust storms for intra-annual variability and by that associated with ENSO or SST anomaly for long-term oscillations. If used in combination with other tracers of natural or anthropogenic origin, these fallout nuclides could find more practical applications such as the study of volcanic eruptions, air pollution and global change issues."
213,climate aerosol,"A less dusty future?. [1] Atmospheric desert dust is potentially highly sensitive to changes in climate, carbon dioxide and human land use. In this study we use 6 different scenarios of the processes responsible for changes in source areas and explore changes in desert dust loading in pre-industrial and future climates, although all the scenario results are likely to be sensitive to the climate model simulations used for this study. Simulations suggest that future dust may be 20 to 60% lower than current dust loadings. The anthropogenic portion of the current dust loading may be as large as 60%, or humans may have caused a 24% decrease in desert dust, depending on the relative importance of land use, carbon dioxide and human induced climate change. These results suggest there may be a high sensitivity of 'natural aerosols' to human intervention, which has enormous implications for climate and biogeochemistry in the future.  or through their interactions with liquid and ice clouds, modulate ocean and terrestrial biogeochemistry, and impact atmospheric photochemistry, thus future predictions of climate must include the impacts of mineral aerosols. Atmospheric mineral aerosols are observed to vary 2–4-fold with glacial cycles as well as within the past 40 years, suggesting that mineral aerosols are sensitive to climate change. Causes of past fluctuations in mineral aerosols and the role of humans in modulating mineral aerosols are not well understood. Explanations for the large changes observed between glacial and interglacial time periods include changes in transport, surface winds, precipitation, and carbon dioxide. Because higher carbon dioxide levels may reduce stomatal conductance leading to increased water use efficiency and increased photosynthesis by C3 plants in general, arid regions may be more productive at higher carbon dioxide levels and thus, unvegetated regions may be reduced under higher carbon dioxide conditions carbon dioxide fertilization . Human disturbance of vegetation and soils has been shown to increase easily erodible soils substantially in in situ studies, but the potential magnitude of this impact is not well established globally. Recent studies argue that satellite retrievals of the absorbing aerosol index from the TOMS suggest that natural low-lying regions are the current optimal sources of mineral aerosols. These regions are thought to contain soil particles in the optimal size distribution due to water based erosion currently or during previous wetter time periods. However, model studies have suggested that atmospheric aerosol distributions are likely to be similar between ‘natural’ source of mineral aerosols and a combination of 50% natural and ‘disturbed’ sources. This is because low-lying regions can have not only easily erodible soils but sometimes more fertile soils than surrounding highland regions e.g., Niger River basin in Africa . Thus, the relative role of humans in disturbing soils and causing desert dust sources is not currently well constrained. for 1880–1889 preindustrial , 1990–1999 current and 2090–2099 future , to make a range of predictions about future mineral aerosol sources, distributions and deposition. For future predictions, the model simulations follow the A1 scenario including sulfate aerosols and green house gases. Meterological fields are archived from CSM1.0 simulations and the offline dust model MATCH/DEAD is used to simulate dust under different climate regimes following the methodology similar to previous studies. Wet and dry deposition are simulated as the loss mechanisms for four different size bins of aerosols transported in the model. Simulations are conducted for the first scenario for 10 years, but comparisons between the 10 year mean and first 3 years suggest that a 3-year simulation is sufficient for this study, and only 3 years are simulated for the other scenarios. Note that predictions of changes in temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, cloudiness, surface winds, as well as transport characteristics are likely to be very sensitive to the climate model simulation used, adding uncertainty to our dust results. continue to be active sources TIMIND or time independent . The second scenario BASE allows the vegetation to shift following temperature, precipitation and cloudiness using the BIOME3 equilibrium vegetation model and output from the CSM1.0 similar to . The third scenario is similar to the BASE scenario, but also allows carbon dioxide fertilization to modulate desert regions BASE-CO2 . In addition, we have three additional scenarios, using the first three scenarios with land use source that accounts for 50% of the entrained dust globally for desert dust CULT + TIMIND, CULT + BASE, CULT + BASE-CO2 . Estimates of future cultivation are highly uncertain. We assume that land use in arid regions in 2090 will be in approximately the same places as today and assume that land use in arid regions is zero in the 1880s which is similar to one prediction http://www.ciesin.org/datasets/rivm/image2.0-home.html , , 1994 , and for both the current and future cultivation in desert use a land use estimate that appears to match available desert dust data for the current climate. The similarity in the spatial distribution of the sources from the TIMIND and CULT sources have been previously published. Note that because we tune the source magnitude in the current climate, in the pre-industrial simulations, the CULT sources will have 50% of the source magnitude of the non-CULT scenario e.g., the magnitude of the TIMIND source in the pre-industrial simulation is twice that of the preindustrial simulation of the TIMIND-CULT scenario .. Once the impacts of carbon dioxide fertilization are included in the vegetation model, the deserts in 1880s expand 14% due to lower carbon dioxide, while in the 2090s decrease in size by 40% Table 1 .. In the case of no change in source areas TIMIND , the model suggests an 11% increase in desert dust in the past and a 20% decrease in desert dust in the future due to changes in soil moisture and surface winds. Including the changes in source areas from Table 1 decreases of 20–60% are predicted in the dust sources in the future Table 2 . In the pre-industrial climate, dust entrainment into the atmosphere may increase by 26% or be smaller by 58%, depending on the scenario. Notice that changes in the scenario such as between vegetation changes, carbon dioxide fertilization or cultivation in deserts appear to produce larger changes than merely a change in meteorology as predicted by the climate model seen in the TIMIND scenario . Simulations in the current climate have been unable to determine the relative roles of the different processes responsible for the forming and modifying the sources i.e., sedimentation from water erosion, land use or carbon dioxide fertilization . However, the large changes in preindustrial desert dust predicted using different scenarios may allow us to distinguish between these scenarios using available data from preindustrial times. The best source of data for the 1880s relative to today are several high resolution ice cores. Unfortunately, ice cores tend to be located in regions far from desert regions and thus may not reflect changes in desert dust sources or distributions in larger regions. Here we present the ratio of pre-industrial to current climate mineral aerosol mass or number concentration in the ice cores mass concentrations are more consistent with the model and we prefer those when available . For the observations we use average of 1950–1990 or the extent of the data for the current climate, and 1850–1899 for the preindustrial climate., while Penny Ice Cap data suggest a 15% decrease. In Asia, Dasuopu data suggest a 35% decrease. In the Andes, Huascaran records suggest a 45% decrease, while Quelccaya data suggests a 15% increase. In the African tropics, Kilimanjaro records suggest a decrease by 25%. In the southern high latitudes, records at Newall Glacier suggest a 20% increase, while Siple Station data suggest a 50% decrease. Thus, ice cores close to each other often suggest different trends, making interpretation of the ice cores more difficult. If we ignore the spatial distribution of the ice cores, the ice cores suggest a mean decrease in deposition of 17% in preindustrial times relative to the current climate but with a standard deviation of ∼25% , similar to the global model estimates for the BASE case Table 2 . Comparisons between observed and modeled ratios are shown in Figure 2 for each ice core. As seen in Figure 2 , no one model scenario can capture the fluctuations at all the ice cores well, perhaps due to local and mesoscale effects or errors in the model. Figure 3 shows a box-plot of each model scenario and the errors at the 8 ice core sites. The BASE scenario has a median or mean value closest to the ice core data, however the spread in errors is quite large. The next best scenario in terms of smallest bias is the CULT + BASECO2 scenario, however, again, the variance is quite large. If we instead evaluated the scenarios based on root mean squared difference between observations and model, we would obtain the result that the TIMIND and CULT + BASECO2 were the closest to the observations. None of the scenarios is clearly much better or much worse, and we are unable to use the limited ice core data to determine which scenario is most likely.Preindustrial/Current climate ratio: Ice core data vs. model results. Ice core data represents mass or number concentrations indicated by an * ratios between pre-industrial and current climate, while model values are mass concentration ratios between pre-industrial and current climate. Locations of the ice cores are as follows: 1 Dasuopu 28°N, 85°E , 2 GISP 72°N, 38°W , 3 Kilimanjaro 3°S, 37°E , 4 Huascaran 9°S, 77°W , 5 Newall Glacier 77°S, 162°E , 6 Penny Ice Cap 67°N, 66°W , 7 Quelccaya 13°S, 70°W , 8 Siple Station 76°S, 84°W .Model minus the observations for the ice core data for each scenario. The maximum and minimum errors are shown as the extent of the vertical line, while the box represents the 1st through 3rd quartiles in errors. The median value is a line through the middle of the box., as well as in ice core data presented here, it is not possible to determine conclusively which of these scenarios is most probable. Our model does not allow interactive vegetation or dust interactions with radiation or clouds and the subsequent impact on vegetation, which would improve the realism of our simulations. Some of the results of these simulations will be sensitive to the particular model and realization used for the dust simulation, although the variability between the scenarios is likely to be similar in different models., causing a positive feedback in carbon dioxide. Additionally, reductions in mineral aerosols may increase surface temperatures and modify clouds, terrestrial biogeochemistry and atmospheric photochemistry near arid regions. These results suggest that the magnitude and uncertainties in aerosol direct and indirect forcing in the current climate may be underestimated in the latest IPCC and highlights the importance of understanding how human activity can impact ‘natural’ aerosols. Our goal in presenting these results is to inspire more detailed studies of both source processes in the current climate as well as feedbacks of mineral aerosols on climate and biogeochemistry in the future."
263,climate aerosol,"Remote sensing of vertical distributions of smoke aerosol off the coast of Africa. In 2004 NASA plans to launch the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations-CALIPSO mission, with a two-wavelength lidar aboard. CALIPSO will fly in formation with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer MODIS on the Aqua satellite. Here we present inversions of combined aircraft lidar and MODIS data to study the properties of smoke off the southwest coast of Southern Africa. The inversion derives profiles of the aerosol extinction due to fine and coarse particles. Comparisons with three sets of airborne in situ measurements show excellent agreement of the aerosol extinction profiles; however the inversion derives smaller spectral dependence of the extinction than the in situ measurements. The inversion is sensitive to the aerosol backscattering-to-extinction ratio BER . Due to nonsphericity of the coarse aerosols, the range of BERs of the smoke aerosol is 0.014 to 0.021 sr -1 for the fine and coarse particles at 0.53 and 1.06 mum wavelengths, which do not differ much from the value for dust 0.016 sr -1 at these wavelengths. . Measurements of the vertical distributions of smoke and pollution aerosols, which carry with them black carbon, are needed to study the effects of aerosol heating of the atmosphere, cooling the Earth's surface and modification to precipitation patterns. to resolve profiles of the extinction coefficient of fine and coarse particles. Here we apply this technique to data collected on Sept. 11, 2000 by MODIS and an airborne lidar off the west coast of Africa during the SAFARI 2000 field experiment, and we compare the results with in situ airborne measurements. The main aerosol in the atmosphere was smoke advected from Africa. provided backscattering attenuated coefficients at wavelengths of 0.53 and 1.06 μm along the track of the aircraft. Results collected during the MODIS pass at 0945 UTC Figure 1 are shown in Figure 2 . The solar zenith angle during the MODIS pass of 34° and nadir view corresponds to glint angle of 34°, lower than the threshold of 40° in the MODIS operational aerosol algorithm. Both the high resolution data altitude resolution of 15 m and the averaged data averaged over 0.3 km altitude intervals for aircraft altitude <7 km and over 0.9 km intervals for altitude >7 km are shown. Both data sets were also averaged over 9 km distance along the aircraft track.MODIS image of the area of the investigation from Sept. 11, 2000. The black line is the path of the ER-2 aircraft with the lidar aboard. The green, blue and red stars show the area of operation of the C-130 and the CV-580 aircraft, corresponding to the data in Figures 3 and 4 .Five profiles of the lidar backscattering coefficients at 0.53 μm and 1.06 μm. Small dots 15 m vertical resolution, large symbols averaged on 300 m layers below 7 km altitude and 900 m layers above. The lidar was calibrated against molecular scattering in the upper part of the atmosphere. The signal to noise ratio at 1.06 μm is 16 times smaller than at 0.53 μm and the quantum efficiency is ∼10 times lower resulting in higher calibration uncertainty. and the University of Washington's CV-580 at 1030–1100 UTC and 23.1°S, 12.4°E. The spectral scattering coefficients were measured with nephelometers and corrected using the procedures described by . It starts from the top aerosol layer, correcting the attenuated backscattering coefficients for scattering above the given layer. The value of η f is derived from the spectral ratio of the measured backscattering coefficients at 0.53 μm β m5 and 1.06 μm β m1 corrected for attenuation: The ratio β m1 /β m5 can be expressed by the ratio of the backscattering to extinction ratios: b 5f , b 5C b 1f and b 1C for each mode at 0.53 and 1.06 μm respectively. Therefore, for a layer at altitude z: The extinction profile is derived from: R eff is the effective aerosol particle radius and BER = ω o P 180 / 4π is the backscattering-to-extinction ratio for spherical Mie particles. The single scattering albedo was taken as ω o 0.53 = 0.90 and ω o 1.06 = 0.85 − and extrapolated linearly for other MODIS wavelengths. that the coarse mode of the smoke is non-spherical. The single scattering albedo, ω o , and phase function of the fine aerosol was adjusted for the higher absorption of smoke aerosol ω o 0.53 = 0.90 and ω o 1.06 = 0.85 − showed that the value of the spheroids phase function in the back scattering direction is half of the values for spheres for radius of 2 μm, making it closer to the value of the phase function for fine aerosols. For comparison, the BER values computed from Table 2 of . The in situ measurements clearly show the presence of the smoke layer between 2 and 5 km, and a boundary layer humid aerosol in the lowest 600 m, similar to the lidar and MODIS inversion Figure 4 . The geometric thickness of the smoke layer varies with time, with a better fit to the inverted data of in situ measurements at 12:52.Extinction profiles derived from the lidar & MODIS data black , in situ nephelometer measurements from the CV-580 blue and the C-130 light and dark green corrected for aerosol absorption using ω o 0.53 = 0.90, and for the difference between the ambient and the nephelometer relative humidity within the boundary layer assuming that the aerosol is sea-salt,. The AATS-14 sunphotometer measured extinction profile red for wavelength of 0.55 μm.. The inversion of active and passive remote sensing data of aerosol was found to agree well with in situ measured profiles of the extinction coefficient, but resulted in a smaller wavelength dependence than measured. This is a typical problem with MODIS, unrelated to the MODIS-lidar retrievals. MODIS derives correctly the aerosol effective radius but underestimates the Ångström exponent for fine aerosol. In the inversion, the BER values of the coarse aerosol and the lidar calibration had to be adjusted. This can be a source of instability in global applications. Table 3 summarizes the sensitivity of the inversion to these parameters. Note that the MODIS calibration accuracy, and the wide spread of the model parameters in Table 1 , calls for a fit with an error of <3% to the MODIS data in most cases. However, the large errors of 9–27% obtained without adjusting either the lidar calibration or the aerosol nonsphericity, is excessively large. Lidar calibration is performed by recording the lidar return from high aerosol-free layers. However, noise in the data, especially at 1.06 μm, can result in errors in calibration for these low signals. Therefore, it is recommended that for significant aerosol concentration e.g., optical thickness >0.2 , the lidar calibration be adjusted to minimize the error in fitting the MODIS data."
102,dust,"African dust aerosols as atmospheric ice nuclei. [1] Measurements of the ice nucleating ability of aerosol particles in air masses over Florida having sources from North Africa support the potential importance of dust aerosols for indirectly affecting cloud properties and climate. The concentrations of ice nuclei within dust layers at particle sizes below 1 mum exceeded 1 cm -3 ; the highest ever reported with our device at temperatures warmer than homogeneous freezing conditions. These measurements add to previous direct and indirect evidence of the ice nucleation efficiency of desert dust aerosols, but also confirm their contribution to ice nuclei populations at great distances from source regions. . Dusts are important atmospheric aerosols for direct climate forcing due to their effect on scattering and absorption of solar radiation. Evidence is mounting for the indirect effects of dust aerosols on clouds. have confirmed relative increases in ice nuclei concentrations during dust storm periods in Israel, and . Linear depolarization ratios δ, the ratio of the returned laser powers in the planes of polarization orthogonal and parallel to that transmitted are presented here from the 0.532 μm channel. Relatively large, non-spherical dust particles can be detected by their strong depolarization.. A representative isentropic backward air trajectory terminating in the project area, determined using the NOAA HYSPLIT model HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model, 1997, http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ready/hysplit4.html is shown in Figure 1 . This indicates a likely source of air from Africa about 1 week prior to aircraft measurements. High aerosol optical depths derived from the MODIS Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument on the Terra satellite, also shown in Figure 1 , document the dust transport during 20–27 July, consistent with trajectories.Ten-day HYSPLIT back trajectory green for the 3 km flight level over Key West at 19Z on 29 July overlain on color-coded MODIS aerosol mean optical depth data for the 8 day period starting on 20 July 2002. Plus marks are days in the trajectory. Latitude and longitude are shown., but the amount of aerosol depolarization may be similar considering the added molecular scattering at sea level. No depolarization is expected for sulfate/organic aerosols.Ice nuclei IN concentration 5 s running mean , aerosol concentration, lidar linear depolarization ratio δ and relative returned power P , and water vapor mixing ratio w and potential temperature θ as a function of altitude on 28 July. IN, FSSP >3.6 μm and thermodynamic data were collected from the Citation aircraft at ∼2200 UTC. CFDC processing conditions for ice nuclei were approximately −37°C and 86% 123% relative humidity with respect to water ice . The dashed curve segment in the IN panel indicates the action of filtering sample air. Aerosol measurements in 0.5 to 1 and 1 to 10 μm size ranges are from the CAS instrument on the WB-57 aircraft at ∼2330 UTC. Lidar data are averages from 1953 to 1958 UTC. Low-altitude lidar signals cannot be used to calculate δ-values because of strong, off-scale signals. on the WB-57 support the presence of a dust layer at 1 to 4 km. Total particle condensation nuclei, not shown numbers were not higher in this layer compared to other levels. The altitude of the dust layer is consistent with the location of Saharan aerosol layers. The vertical profiles of aerosol data and nearly constant water vapor mixing ratio and potential temperature through the dust layer are similar to those obtained by . Median ice nuclei concentrations are typically below 0.01 cm −3 . Elevated ice nuclei concentrations for the same processing conditions were also noted in coincidence with a dust layer on 29 July 2002. , Angström exponent values for aerosols inferred from AERONET Aerosol Robotic NETwork sun photometer measurements near Miami exceeded 1.3 at the time of the Citation flight. This indicates a predominance of aerosols aloft that were smaller than on 28–29 July when Angström exponents ranged from 0.3 to 0.5. Additionally, only weak transport of Saharan dust was evident from MODIS retrieved aerosol optical depth during the period around 18 July. We therefore consider this day to represent “non-dust” conditions for July in Florida., but are at least 20 times lower than peak concentrations noted in the dust layer on 28–29 July. These lower IN concentrations on 18 July, consistent with the absence of strong desert dust loading above the marine boundary layer, emphasize the unusual nature of the IN measurements within dust layers.Mixing ratio, potential temperature, and IN and FSSP concentrations for the 18 July 2002 “no dust” case. IN processing conditions were approximately constant at −24°C and 104% 134% relative humidity with respect to water ice . IN measurements were within a cirrus anvil above 6.4 km. There were no IN measurements below 1.8 km. High concentrations of dust particles acting as ice nuclei in clouds could lead to changes in cloud microphysical and radiative properties, latent heating and precipitation compared to more pristine conditions. While detailed numerical modeling studies to elucidate such effects are outside of the scope of this paper, simple considerations based on previous model sensitivity studies are instructive. For example, if IN concentrations of 1 cm −3 reach the upper troposphere, heterogeneous ice nucleation could dominate the formation of ambient cirrus in preference to homogeneous freezing of more abundant haze e.g., sulfate particles and thereby alter cloud forcing and upper tropospheric relative humidity. The simple exercise not detailed here of increasing IN concentrations by 100 times to noted levels in a microphysical model of adiabatic cumulus cloud parcels suggests that ice formation could deplete cloud water and prevent homogeneous freezing in maritime clouds with updrafts as large as 12 m s −1 . Investigations are underway to compare cumuli and anvil cirrus properties on dusty versus less dusty days during CRYSTAL-FACE. and Asian sources can dominate fine aerosol mass at times in spring through summer. The annual dust minimum occurs during winter, with potential implications for the natural efficiency of winter precipitation and the formation of supercooled drizzle, an aircraft icing hazard. It is therefore important to further quantify the annual dust cycle, how it may be altered and the indirect effects of dust on ice phase clouds and precipitation."
266,dust atmosphere aerosol climate,"Observations of large aerosol infrared forcing at the surface. Studies of aerosol effects on the Earth's energy budget usually consider only the cooling effects at short solar wavelengths, but we demonstrate that they also have important warming effects at thermal infrared IR wavelengths that have rarely been observed and are commonly ignored in climate models. We use high-resolution spectra to obtain the IR radiative forcing at the surface for aerosols encountered in the outflow from northeastern Asia. The spectra were measured by the Marine-Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer M-AERI from the NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown during the Aerosol Characterization Experiment-Asia ACE-Asia . We show that the daytime surface IR forcing are often a few Wm -2 and can reach almost 10 Wm -2 for large aerosol loadings. Thus, even the smaller aerosol IR forcing observed here are comparable to or greater than the 1 to 2 Wm -2 IR surface enhancement from increases in greenhouse gases. These results highlight the importance of aerosol IR forcing which should be included in climate model simulations. . For example, mineral aerosols have complex, highly varied optical properties that, for equal loadings, can cause differences in the surface IR flux between 7 and 25 Wm −2 . Consequently, only a few large-scale climate models currently consider aerosol IR effects despite their potentially large forcing. For instance, calculations by , in the atmosphere, or at the top of the atmosphere. Thus, our understanding of IR aerosol forcing is largely model-based with the unknowns therein with few direct observations available for validation. We address this issue using a survey of data obtained from the NOAA Ship, 2003 ... It measured IR sky radiance spectra from 520 to 3020 cm −1 about 18 to 3 μm at ∼0.5 cm −1 resolution, with a narrow field-of-view 45 mrad, full angle at 0° overhead and 55° to zenith. Each cloud-free spectrum contains the combined downward emissions by aerosols and greenhouse gases e.g., H 2 O, CO 2 . Direct observational determinations of aerosol IR forcing are scarce because of the difficulty in isolating the aerosol signal from the background gaseous emissions. Here we make use of several M-AERI features that make this determination possible: 1 it has two on-board black body references, which produce a real-time calibration that is accurate to better than 1% of the ambient radiance; 2 it has a fast measurement frequency, providing a spectrum every 10 min; and 3 its high spectral resolution enables isolating the atmospheric windows, where gaseous emission is weak enough for aerosol IR forcing to be significant outside the windows the aerosol emission is swamped by strong gaseous emissions . In addition, the M-AERI radiance spectra can be inverted to retrieve the water vapor and temperature profiles for the lowest 3 km of the atmosphere. These retrievals are important for separating the IR signatures of the lower atmospheric aerosols from the variations in the atmospheric background caused by fluctuations in the temperature and water vapor profiles. The iterative retrieval process requires an initial guess of the temperature and moisture profiles, which is obtained from radiosondes that were launched from the ship two to five times a day., i.e., This aerosol radiance effect is converted to an aerosol IR radiative forcing flux using a radiance-to-flux conversion. We focus on the 10-μm atmospheric window, where most about 87% of the aerosol forcing occurs. Note that the aerosol IR forcing thus obtained is a bulk, energetic quantity that implicitly includes the net surface radiative effects of aerosol amount, composition, size, height and temperature. This is different from aerosol retrievals, where the effects of the intermediate atmosphere would be removed. An advantage of using IR forcing is that it directly conveys the net IR effect of aerosol as seen in the surface energy balance.. LBLRTM has been validated and improved using AERI data. We use a recent release of LBLRTM v6.01 with v2.4.1 of the CKD water vapor continuum with the HITRAN database that provides the spectroscopic line parameters HITRAN-2000 v11, updated through 4/2001 . Our line-by-line model spectra are made comparable to the observed spectra by applying a sinc scanning function using the M-AERI maximum optical path difference length of an equivalent interferometer of ±1.037 cm −1 .. The boundary layer profile of the nearest ozonesonde is scaled to match the concentration of the lowest level to the surface ozone measurement, and the upper atmospheric ozone concentrations are scaled to match the total column measured by the Microtops. Uncertainties in the ozone profile can lead to conspicuous spectral features e.g., a sharp ‘trough’ or ‘finger’ appearing in the radiance residuals of the 1000–1050 cm −1 ozone band. The radiative flux within such a feature is small, usually <0.5 Wm −2 , and the ozone profile is tuned to remove it.. When the two view angles are used, the regression coefficients are independent of the aerosol type and amount, and of the boundary layer water vapor amount. The flux conversions are accurate to within 0.1 Wm −2 for most cases and 0.25 Wm −2 for all cases., we find that the sondes and M-AERI retrievals usually agree to within 2% to −5% of the boundary layer water vapor column. However, larger deviations are accompanied by a ‘spike’ in the radiance residual near 800 cm −1 . The occurrence of this spectral feature in the analysis suggests that the M-AERI retrieval is suspect and the case is rejected., which was calibrated via Langley regressions performed at the Mauna Loa Observatory. The optical depths increased dramatically as the ship approached Japan and, particularly, when it entered the Sea of Japan Figure 1 . Many of the aerosol optical depths are greater than 0.4, and a few even reach about 1.0.Observationally determined aerosol IR forcing for the cruise. Left axis gives the daytime aerosol IR surface forcing ♦ ; right axis gives the aerosol optical depth at 500 nm □ . Shading indicates days for which the aerosol IR forcing is evaluated, which is where optical depths are greater than about 0.3 and a converged M-AERI retrieval exists. Error bars for the aerosol IR forcing are based on the analysis described in the text. Uncertainties in the optical depths are about 0.01 not plotted . Cruise transit locations given above the plot. Hachijo Island is off the southeast coast of Japan; the Port of Yokosuka is located at the entrance to Tokyo Bay. The Ronald H. Brown airmass classification indicates signs of continental aerosols at the surface beginning YD 84.. Because infrared fluxes do not have the same kind of pronounced diurnal cycle as shortwave fluxes, these instantaneous IR aerosol forcing serve as estimates of the longer-term average of the IR forcing. Our analysis is restricted to daytime values because we use visible data for cloud screening. Nighttime values could be different because of thermal effects resulting from aerosol solar heating during the daytime, and nighttime relative humidity effects on aerosol size that might enhance the aerosol emission, contingent on factors such as aerosol advection and height changes., and the boundary layer for YD 102 contained large concentrations of dust that changed throughout the day. Thus, accurately modeling the aerosol IR forcing requires an adequate specification of the variations of these aerosol properties within the atmospheric column. Details of how factors such as aerosol height, size, and water vapor amount affect the IR forcing are diagnosed in a separate modeling study. Further, within that study, these observed IR forcing have been modeled with good agreement using independent measurements of the aerosol chemical and optical properties made during the cruise. This supports the veracity of the methodology used to extract the aerosol IR forcing from the observed spectra. because the climate response depends not only on the energy balance at the TOA, but also on the heating at the surface and its atmospheric profile. The magnitude of these daytime observed IR surface forcing are significant. The largest IR forcings represent an increase of about 20 to 40% depending on the column water vapor amount of the aerosol-free flux in the central portion of the window 800–1250 cm −1 . Furthermore, the forcing observed here are comparable to or larger than the 1 to 2 Wm −2 change in the globally averaged surface IR forcing caused by greenhouse gas increases since pre-industrial times. This surface greenhouse enhancement should not be confused with the value at the tropopause that is commonly used in climate studies. Of course the episodic nature of the aerosol forcing do not have the constancy of greenhouse gas forcing but, during this period, such episodes were prevalent within northeastern Asia. Thus, aerosol IR forcing of the magnitudes observed here modify the surface energy balance by a magnitude that may be important for the climate. Note that by comparing the surface forcing by aerosol to that by greenhouse gases, we do not intend to imply that they share the same degree of anthropogenic origin. Only that, without including aerosol IR forcing, models used for climate and climate change studies may be missing an important forcing, regardless of whether the aerosol source is natural or anthropogenic.. Unravelling climate interactions, especially over for long-term climate trends, requires ascertaining and treating all of the radiatively important components of the climate system. Consistent with prior modeling studies our observational analysis indicates that aerosol IR forcing can be significant and, thus, should be included in climate model simulations."
267,aerosol,"Record heavy Asian dust in Beijing in 2002: Observations and model analysis of recent events. [1] A record heavy Yellow Sand event was observed on 20 March in Beijing. This event was unusual because the wind speed was low and the dust concentration was extremely high at the dust front. Observations with a polarization lidar, an optical particle counter, and a high-volume sampler were performed throughout the event in Beijing. The visibility derived from the lidar data was 650 m, and the total suspended particle concentration was 11 mg/m3 at the peak. Chemical transport model analysis revealed that the main part of the dust originated in the Mongolian border area near Ejinaqi. This dust event severely affected Korea and northern Japan. Continuous lidar observations in Beijing, Nagasaki and Tsukuba revealed that the frequency of dust events in 2001 and 2002 was similar in Beijing but much higher in 2002 in Nagasaki and Tsukuba. The model showed dust was transported to the east more frequently in 2002 and the difference is probably related to the smaller perturbation of the westerly jet. This indicates that a slight change in climate can cause a large difference in dust phenomena in the northwestern Pacific region. . Mineral dust has various effects on the atmospheric environment, including chemical and radiative effects, and also on the oceanic environment. Effects of heavy dust events on human health have also become a concern recently. Some statistics indicate that the number of dust events has been increasing in recent years. However, observations for quantitatively estimating the amount of dust generated and transported are lacking. To study dust phenomena quantitatively, we started observations in 2001 with a sampling network in northeastern China and continuously operated polarization lidars in Beijing and two locations in Japan Nagasaki and Tsukuba . Polarization lidars are effective tools for monitoring Asian dust sensitively. We also employ a chemical transport model Chemical Weather Forecast System CFORS to analyze dust phenomena. Our goal is to achieve quantitative understanding by improving the model with observations.., after applying a geometrical-form-factor correction. We used single-component Klett's method instead of two-component Fernald's method because the scattering of dust aerosols was much higher than molecular scattering. We set a boundary condition at the height where the attenuated signal intensity is 50 times of theoretical Rayleigh scattering signal intensity from the atmospheric molecules. We then increased the boundary value and confirmed the convergence of the inversion result.. We estimated the rate of contribution of dust in extinction coefficient R with the following equations assuming external mixing of dust and spherical aerosols. R = { δ − δ 2 1 + δ 1 /{ 1 + δ δ 1 − δ 2 }, where δ 1 and δ 2 are ADRs of dust and air-pollution aerosols. δ is the observed ADR. Values of δ 1 and δ 2 were determined empirically. Observed ADR in Beijing was about 0.05 in the clear cases and 0.35 in heavy dust cases. We consequently used δ 1 = 0.35 and δ 2 = 0.05.. The simulation domain adopted is centered at 25°N, 115°E. The horizontal grid consists of 100 by 90 grid points, with a resolution of 80 km. In the vertical dimension, the domain is divided into 23 layers. The present CFORS system includes the following chemical transport species: SO 2 /Sulfate, DMS, volcano tracer, megacity urban plume, black carbon, organic carbon, sea salt, CO, hydrocarbons, and Radon and mineral dust 12 bins, ranging from 0.1 to 20 μm in radius . Mineral dust emissions are calculated on-line using a vertical dust deflatation scheme as a power law function of surface friction velocity u * . Dust emission areas are defined as desert and semi-desert areas in the US Geological Survey vegetation database based on NOAA/AVHRR data obtained in 1992/93 . Snow cover data is used to mask emission areas.  Figure 3 indicates the number of particles observed with an OPC with 10 diameter discrimination levels, wind speed observed at the meteorological observatory in Beijing, and the TSP observed at SJCEP. Wind speed and dust density calculated by CFORS are also indicated. The OPC data revealed that the increase of large particles was steep in the 20 March case. It was more gradual in the 6 April case, and a drastic decrease of small particles is seen during the increase of large particles. The wind speed plot shows that in both case the wind increased to about 10 m/s when the dust front arrived. After the passage of the dust front, the wind subsided in the 20 March case and increased in the 6 April case. In the latter case, the density of small aerosols air pollution aerosols was extremely high before the dust event, and the particles were blown away by the wind with the dust storm. Similar situations are often observed in the beginning of dust events in Beijing. The TSP observed at SJFCEP reached 11 mg/m 3 at the peak on 20 March. This was extremely high and is consistent with the lidar-obtained extinction coefficient of 6 km −1 when we apply a mass/extinction conversion factor of 1.78 mg/m 3 /km −1 , which we determined for dust in Beijing from the TSP and lidar data of 2001. It must be noted, however, that the mass/extinction conversion factor depends on particle size distribution. This value can be applied only to typical dust in Beijing. The conversion factor is generally smaller for smaller particles. The CFORS results explained the features of the observed time variations of dust concentration and wind speed in both cases. In the dust season of 2002, dust was transported to Japan more frequently than in 2001, and several severe dust phenomena were reported in Korea. The continuous lidar data show that, from March to May, a dust layer depolarization ratio >10% was observed at heights of 0 to 6 km for 63 67 days in Beijing, for 27 25 days in Nagasaki, and for 11 24 days in Tsukuba in 2001 2002 . The result indicates that the number of days was similar in Beijing and Nagasaki for 2001 and 2002 but doubled in Tsukuba. This suggests that the emission of dust was similar but the transport pattern was different. CFORS also shows the difference in transport patterns not shown . Major dust events observed in Beijing usually originate in Inner Mongolia and/or Mongolia and are transported rapidly to Beijing by strong westerlies with the storm. The main part of dust stream is usually transported north before reaching Korea. However, in 2002, heavy dust streams reached Korea several times. This was probably related to the fact that the perturbations in the westerly jet was smaller in 2002. In the current calculation with CFORS, the same surface conditions were used for both years. To understand these dust phenomena more quantitatively, we must further investigate surface conditions. The change of dust emission due to the change in surface conditions probably has significant effects in a longer time scale. The present study indicated that a change in transport pattern due to a slight change in climate can also cause a large difference in dust phenomena in the northwestern Pacific region."
269,climate aerosol,"Radiative absorption capability of Asian dust with black carbon contamination. Radiative forcing by mineral dust is one of the major uncertainties in assessing the impact of aerosols on the climate. Coagulation and condensation of pollutants on dust particles can further complicate the problem by altering their optical properties. During four Asian dust events in the spring 2002, concentration and size distribution of aerosols were measured in Taipei, Taiwan. Black carbon BC , organic carbon OC and optical properties of the dust aerosols were measured. We found that both the mass specific absorption efficiency and imaginary refractive index of the aerosols decreased significantly during the dust events because of reduced black carbon concentrations. In addition the black carbon in aerosols was found to have significantly higher absorption efficiency than that adopted in current climate models. We suggest that the higher absorption efficiency is due to the formation of an internal mixture of BC and other particulate matter. . The dust particles are usually transported by westerlies to eastern China, Korea, Japan, and sometimes across thousands of miles to north Pacific and even the American Continent. During dust storms, extremely high concentrations of aerosols were frequently observed over East Asia. Even in North America, significant amounts of dust were occasionally found to raise environmental concerns. One of the major issues of the dust particles is their radiative forcing of climate change. Important implications of tropospheric aerosols to climate change have been proposed for a long time. However, accurate estimate of the radiative forcing of tropospheric aerosols is still difficult to reach. Previous studies of the climate forcing of sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols indicated that the radiative forcing of green house gases could be offset partially by Mie scattering effect of aerosols. During the past decade, the direct radiative forcing by dust also attracted significant attention. However, there has been relatively little discussion about the radiative forcing of dust particles mixed with anthropogenic pollutants until recently.. The apparent transmission T a of a 632.8 nm laser beam through the quartz filter is given by: where I pf and I f are the light intensities passing through the sampling filter and a blank filter, respectively In practice, an average I f of ten blank filters was used in this work to account for the differences in filters . We assume that the attenuation of the laser beam follows the Beer-Lambert law: where X is the optical path length, which is determined from the volume of sampled air and the effective cross-section area of the filter. We can then define the apparent attenuation A a caused by the particulate matter on the filter and measure it as the negative logarithm of T a , i.e., A a = −ln T a . Finally, the value of σ a is obtained from equation 2 with the knowledge of A a and X .. For externally-mixed aerosols and light-loading filter samples, the bias might be further increased to some degree.. Because the definition of “EC” in the IMPROVE protocol is actually based upon the light reflectance of the filter sample at 632.8nm, it is reasonable to assume to be equivalent to “BC”. While the size distribution of PM10 shifted toward larger particles during a dust event that of BC particles shifted even more. Figure 3 shows the evolution of the mass median aerodynamic diameter MMAD of PM10, OC, and BC during a typical dust event March 5–10, 2002 . Because it is quite unlikely that BC particles can grow up to 1.5 μm by themselves, coagulation with dust particles during transport is the most reasonable explanation for the “growth” of BC particles. This finding of size distribution shift of BC is consistent with the modeled results of ,.Aerosol absorption coefficient as a function of the black carbon concentration. A linear regression line solid line of data from this work solid square gives an average value of 23.7 m 2 /g for the mass specific absorption efficiency of black carbon α BC in the aerosols. Data of ACE-Asia open circle and dash line are plotted for comparison.. Our values are about a factor of 2 larger than theirs 11 ± 5 m 2 /g . However, it should be noted that the values of α BC in the data set of ACE-Asia scatter over a factor of eight 5–40 m 2 /g . A major uncertainty in determining α BC may be due to imprecise measurement of aerosol absorption coefficient as described in section 2 . Because similar measurement techniques were used in the two studies, similar uncertainties were expected. The detection limit of the carbon analysis system in this work is 0.2 μgC/cm 2 in terms of filter loading, which is about 4–17% of the field levels of BC concentration during our observation. However, it can contribute significantly to the airborne measurements where concentrations are relatively small. This could be one of the reasons that contributes to the large scattering of the airborne data.. This also agrees with the observations by . However, this work was conducted at a single station over a short period, it may not be representative of the value for the dust/BC mixture in this region. Finally, this study shows that our quantitative knowledge of optical property of dust/BC aerosols is rather limited and uncertain. Given the large area affected by the Asian dust, more comprehensive investigations of the radiative property of BC/dust mixture are imperative."
270,climate aerosol ocean,"Atmospheric iron delivery and surface ocean biological activity in the Southern Ocean and Patagonian region. [1] Iron is a limiting nutrient for biologic activity in much of the world ocean. We present a method to quantitatively address the response of surface ocean biology to inputs of atmospheric Fe associated with atmospheric dust. We merge two enabling technologies, global models of Earth system processes and satellite derived chlorophyll concentrations to assess the importance of Fe in oceanic biogeochemistry. We present an objective correlation analysis to elucidate the spatial response of chlorophyll to iron flux considering the ocean surface meridional center of mass in areas with high correlation. Several regions between 40 degreesS and 60 degreesS show correlations from 0.6 to 0.95, significant at the 0.05 level, particularly the Patagonian region. Surface chlorophyll and iron flux follow similar patterns, however chlorophyll may be displaced to different latitudes than where Fe input occurs due to meridional ocean transport. . Since much of the global ocean is far removed from significant oceanic sources of iron, such as rivers, upwelling and shallow water sediments, the flux of dust iron transported by the atmosphere may play a significant role in biological activity. We perform an empirical analysis between ocean surface monthly averages of simulated atmospheric dust-iron deposition Φ fe and remotely sensed chlorophyll Chl . The premise that we are testing involves the idea that atmospheric iron deposition could be correlated with surface ocean remotely sensed chlorophyll. The correlations are expected to be the highest where iron is an important limiting nutrient, however we focus on regions where high correlations in the Southern hemisphere are observed. The first part of our analysis is to identify, with 2.0° × 2.5° latitude-longitude spatial resolution, regions of the world ocean where Chl is correlated in time with Φ fe. We study the correlation of the monthly anomalies, computed by subtracting the mean of the time series from each monthly value, to assess the response of Chl departures to those of Φ fe . It is important to note that high correlations do not imply a tight coupling between Φ fe and Chl. We carry out an objective analysis by computing their meridional band ‘Center of Mass’ in the regions where we find high correlations. This allows us to estimate the loci of higher Chl and Φ fe every month and to determine if there is a relationship when the two fields are collocated. Finally, we augment this computation with an interpretation of the time mean surface ocean transport to elucidate the latitude deviations between Chl and Φ fe center of masses. These results may be useful in understanding the biogeochemical cycles in these regions and highlight specific regions of the ocean where observational studies could be focused to assess the importance of atmospheric Fe deposition on ocean biology.. The model is driven by assimilated meteorological fields from the Goddard Earth Observatory Data Assimilation System GEOS DAS . The Fe deposition data sets have been simulated since 1981 and we have sub-sampled the global Fe deposition field for the Southern hemisphere and the years 2000–2001.. Figure 1 shows the anomaly correlation fields for the 2000–2001 iron deposition flux estimates and simultaneous SeaWiFS data. There are large regions of the Southern Ocean where the correlations are greater than 0.8, like the South Atlantic east of Argentina, a region highly influenced by aeolian iron flux from the Patagonian Desert. This region is influenced by intense western boundary currents, Brazil and West wind drift part of the nutrient rich Antartic Circumpolar Current and its domain includes the large continental shelf of Falkland Island. South of Australia, a HNLC region, a moderate correlation is found ranging from 0.6–0.8. Although the Patagonian region is affected by several biophysical forcings that can affect Fe concentrations, we consistently found a high correlation here using other periods and satellite observations. Because of this we center our attention to explore direct response between the two fields in this region. Figure 2 shows the zonal means for the region 0°–60°W of the anomaly correlation, indicating a strong relationship between atmospheric Fe flux to the surface ocean and biological activity from 40°–60°S. An important point to note is that these are maps of anomaly correlation coefficients and the high values indicate those regions where Fe deposition and biological activity are strongly coupled via the biogeochemistry of a limiting nutrient, Fe. These regions are, in fact, regions of relatively low absolute atmospheric Fe flux compared to many Northern hemisphere oceanic regions downwind from large desert areas. This indicates that regions that may be Fe limited are very efficient at using even small amounts of Fe very quickly.Atmospheric dust Fe flux and SeaWiFS chlorophyll Chl anomaly correlation maps for the Southern Hemisphere. Large regions east of Patagonia show a strong correlation between Chl and atmospheric supply of dust-Fe. These data are from 2000–2001 monthly averages of Fe deposition and SeaWiFS Chl .Zonal mean of the anomaly correlations in Figure 1 for the region O-60W. and the latitudinal variation of the coriolis parameter f to compute the meridional Sverdrup transport My . Here curl z τ h represents the vertical component of the curl of wind stress. Around 50°S–45°S the region experiences a southerly transport of about 0.5 Sv that moves the water mass with significant atmospheric Fe input a bit to the south, resulting in a movement south of the chlorophyll CM's. This may in some cases explain the lack of direct correlation between the mean and/or anomaly fields of dust deposition and chlorophyll.The ‘Center of Mass calculation’ for SeaWiFS ocean color and Fe deposition for the region 40°S–65°S, 40°W–70°W. The circles indicate chlorophyll and the stars indicate dust Fe flux. The main point is that the Center of Mass CM of the Fe flux and the chlorophyll are for the most part co-located for most of the analyses in the region of high anomaly correlation. Surface currents may advect the Chl signal away from the region of highest Fe input. Based on independent analyses of the correlation of iron deposition and remotely sensed chlorophyll, there are high correlations in several regions of the mid-high latitude Southern hemisphere. This is consistent with presently held tenets where Fe may be a limiting micronutrient. We note that the regions of highest correlations are not the regions of highest dust flux. This analyses points out those regions where ocean biology is possibly tightly coupled with atmospheric Fe deposition. An additional conclusion is that there are many areas that have relatively high Fe deposition but little or no correlation with Chl .. and space based remotely sensed satellite data. Such calculations may provide guidance and input for the planning of field experiments and will become increasingly more valuable as more satellite data becomes available and numerical simulations of global biogeochemical cycles are included explicitly in Earth system models."
271,aerosol,"North American, Asian, and Indian haze: Similar regional impacts on climate?. [1] Pollution plumes recur seasonally downwind of the Indian subcontinent and Asian continent due to industrial and vehicular emissions, biomass burning, and wind-blown dust. These plumes have been well documented by field campaigns and satellite observations and the environmental implications of the ""Asian Brown Cloud'' have been widely publicized in a recently released UNEP report [UNEP and C 4, 2002]. Recent field experiments, however, demonstrate that the U. S. pollution plume can be as intense in terms of aerosol mass concentration, aerosol optical depth, and ozone mixing ratio as those downwind of India and Asia affecting regional climate along the U. S. East Coast. The use of identical sampling protocols in these experiments has been key in eliminating sampling biases and making the data directly comparable. . In March through May a plume extends from Asia eastward across the North Pacific Ocean. During the winter monsoon period December through April , a plume is located off the southwest coast of India over the Indian Ocean. In the summer months of June through August an aerosol plume originates from the mid-Atlantic states of the United States and extends across the North Atlantic Ocean. Although satellite observations show the seasonal regularity and relative magnitude of these plumes in terms of backscattered radiation they do not provide information about the aerosol chemical composition, optical properties, or mass loading in the boundary layer. Such information can be obtained from in situ measurements and is required to fully understand the regional climate effects of the haze. In situ measurements made during recent intensive field campaigns have characterized boundary layer aerosol properties in plumes emanating from the Indian subcontinent INDOEX , Asia ACE Asia , and the eastern U.S. NEAQS .. All in situ aerosol measurements were made at a constant RH of 55 ± 5% to maintain constant instrumental size cuts despite variations in ambient RH. The ambient RH encountered over all experiments ranged from 35 to nearly 100%. Here, submicron refers to all particles with aerodynamic diameters ≤1.1 um at 55% RH. We focus on submicron particulates as they are of the size range most likely to be transported over long distances and have the greatest radiative impact on climate in the visible wavelengths.. TARFOX was an aircraft study; we include only data collected at altitudes less than or equal to 300 m. The aerosol properties and ozone mixing ratios that are reported here for all experiments represent regional values since the platforms were moving within the study region rather than located at a fixed site.. ACE Asia samples were divided into three categories: Marine, Polluted, and Polluted with Dust. “Marine” encompasses the ship's transit from Hawaii to Japan when sampled air masses had not been in contact with land for 3 or more days prior to being sampled. It is included as a background reference. “Polluted” includes time periods when air masses had passed over Japan, Korea, and/or China less than 2 days before reaching the ship and had not passed over dust source regions. “Polluted with Dust” is similar to “Polluted” but has the additional constraint that the sampled air masses had passed over dust source regions in northern China and/or Mongolia prior to reaching the ship. The ship did not encounter pure dust during ACE Asia. Using the same strategy, INDOEX sampling periods were categorized as “Arabia” or “India.” Only one category is included for NEAQS; it includes time periods when trajectories indicated offshore flow from the region between New York and New Hampshire to the Atlantic. The TARFOX data are from periods of offshore flow as indicated by calculated air mass trajectories.. Seasonally January to March and spatially 0° to 30°N averaged AOD for these five years varied by less than 10% of the 1999 values. Similarly, the summer mean values of AOD measured at Greenbelt, MD, a site in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., varied by less than 15% between 1993 and 1996 indicating that the 1996 TARFOX values were representative of other years. In addition, the regional mean AOD measured during NEAQS was within 18% of regional mean summer values derived from 5 Aeronet sites along the mid-Atlantic coast in 1993 and 1996. Dust storms from northern China and Mongolia have increased noticeably in frequency and intensity during the past three years http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/estnews051702.htm . The dust storm sampled aboard the Ronald H. Brown during ACE Asia was a major event that extended across the Pacific, North America, and the Atlantic. Hence, the ACE Asia time period may represent an upper bound in dust emissions.. During INDOEX, the aerosol lifetime was estimated to be 7 to 8 days due to a lack of wet deposition. Similary dry conditions during NEAQS and ACE Asia are expected to have led to equivalent lifetimes. Given short transport times relative to the aerosol lifetime and assuming minimal dilution of the air from mixing across the marine boundary layer inversion, the concentration of particulates in the plume should remain fairly constant 100 to 1400 km from shore. The uniformity of the aerosol concentration downwind of India is confirmed by satellite-derived average AOD for a two week period during INDOEX. Values ranged from 0.35 to 0.4 for the region extending westward from the coast of India to 68°E longitude. This region encompassed the cruise track of Ronald H. Brown. Mean submicron aerosol mass concentrations were highest for the ACE Asia Polluted with Dust case Figure 1a where dust made up 22% of the fine mass Figure 2 . The NEAQS mean submicron mass concentration was about 40% higher than the ACE Asia Polluted and the INDOEX India cases. Fine particulate mass was not directly measured during TARFOX.Average submicron mass fractions MF of the aerosol chemical species for ACE Asia, INDOEX, and NEAQS. MF are based on the gravimetrically-determined aerosol mass and concentrations of the chemical species. The MF of H 2 O is that calculated to be associated with the ionic chemical species at 55% RH. POM is estimated by multiplying the measured concentration of OC by a factor of 1.6 to 2.1 to account for associated H and O. Even more striking differences are seen in the organic aerosol data. The TARFOX mean organic carbon OC concentration reported as μg C m −3 was 1 to 7 times that measured in ACE Asia and INDOEX Figure 1c and the NEAQS mean concentration was 1.5 to 6 times higher. Particulate organic matter POM made up a larger fraction of the submicron aerosol mass during NEAQS mean and 1σ standard deviation of 51 ± 19%; range of 18 to 80% than during INDOEX 6 to 15% or ACE Asia 18 to 24% Figure 2 . POM was estimated to make up, on average, 50% of the dry aerosol mass during TARFOX. Ozone concentrations are compared for the 1100 to 1700 local time period when concentrations are expected to be highest Figure 1f . Mean ozone concentrations were within 10% for TARFOX, NEAQS, and both ACE Asia Polluted cases. However, TARFOX and NEAQS concentrations extended to values that are a factor of 2 to 1.5 higher, respectively, than the ACE Asia Polluted cases. Low ozone concentrations off the Indian coast have been attributed to a high initial VOC/NO x ratio and/or the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by absorbing aerosol. As for the Asian and Indian subcontinent plumes, the aerosol plume emanating from the eastern U.S. has regional climate implications. Aerosol single scattering albedo SSA is the ratio of scattering by the aerosol to extinction where extinction is a sum of the scattering and absorption by the aerosol and thus indicates the absorptivity of the aerosol. SSA was derived from aerosol scattering and absorption coefficients measured at 55% RH. Using the simultaneously measured response of scattering by the aerosol to changes in relative humidity or f RH , the SSA was adjusted to ambient RH. SSA is shown for all experimental categories in Figure 3 . The mean SSA and range of values observed during TARFOX, NEAQS, and ACE Asia were similar ≈0.94 ± 0.03 . These values are higher than the INDOEX India case 0.88 ± 0.02 due to the higher mass fraction of BC in the INDOEX aerosol Figure 2 . Depending on the vertical distribution of SSA the values in Figure 3 only apply to the lowest 300 m , the cloud fraction, and the surface albedo, this difference may lead to regional differences in the sign of the top of the atmosphere TOA forcing. It has been estimated that aerosols have a net negative cooling versus positive warming TOA forcing for SSA greater than 0.95 and less than 0.85, respectively. , the Indian subcontinent −20 ± 4 W m 2 , and Asia −20 to −25 W m 2 . These large negative surface forcings indicate a loss of shortwave radiation within the plume and a cooling of the underlying surface. Hence, the direct clear sky radiative effect of aerosols appears to be as large for the eastern U.S. plume as for plumes emanating from Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The mechanism of the forcing may not be the same in all regions, however, due to different SSA. To aid policy actions, year-round measurements of ozone and aerosol properties close to the coast of New England and the mid-Atlantic states both at the surface and aloft are needed to assess the variability and long term trends of the pollution haze. Shorter-term intensive field experiments are needed to link the emissions of precursor species with the transport, transformation, and fate of ozone and aerosols and thereby improve our capabilities to forecast atmospheric species concentrations under different emission scenarios.. As a result, regional air quality and climate issues become hemispheric or, in some cases, global issues. International cooperation is thus critical to understanding and mitigating these environmental issues."
272,dust,"Mineral aerosol and cloud interactions. [1] Interactions between aerosols and clouds are the subject of considerable scientific research, due to the importance of clouds in controlling climate. Here we consider the relationship between mineral aerosols and cloud properties over North Africa and the North Atlantic using monthly mean observations of mineral aerosols and clouds over 16 years. The results of this study are consistent with mineral aerosols suppressing precipitation in thin low altitude clouds and changing cloud amounts in ice phase clouds. Because we cannot eliminate either spurious correlations, or that the cloud and dust changes are both driven by the same meteorological conditions, we cannot provide definitive conclusions. However, these results suggest complicated and tantalizing feedbacks between mineral aerosols and climate. This question becomes crucial as we note that mineral aerosols from North Africa have increased substantially since the 1960s for reasons which are poorly understood but that may be linked to human activity. . Previous studies have suggested from in situ and event-based studies that mineral aerosols interact with liquid clouds by suppressing precipitation. In addition, there is some evidence that mineral aerosols can act as effective ice formation nuclei. In this study, we consider whether existing large-scale, long term datasets are consistent with the hypothesis that mineral aerosols interact with both liquid water and ice clouds.. Uncertainties in this dataset come from the misidentification of clouds and inaccurate retrieval algorithms and are thought to be <10%. Observational data suggests that the ISCCP D2 dataset does not clearly identify thin cirrus clouds, particularly in the morning hours, perhaps because of the presence of low-level clouds beneath the cirrus clouds. ISCCP data separates clouds by height of the top of the cloud and optical depth into low, medium and high clouds, as well as thin, medium and thick clouds and liquid water or ice clouds. Definitions of thin, medium and thick depend on the retrieved optical thickness of the cloud, while high clouds include all clouds which extend above 440mb, whatever level they entrain at.. The large aerosol plume located over North Africa is mostly due to desert dust, although biomass burning aerosols increase in relative importance closer to the equator. We use two methods to estimate dusty versus non-dusty months. The first method uses the Barbados in situ surface concentration dataset for the same years and in the second method we used an area average of TOMS AI. While the Barbados surface concentration dataset represents mineral aerosols at a point at the western edge of the tropical North Atlantic, model studies see see . The correlation between the monthly averages in dust at Barbados and in TOMS AI in this region is 0.78 with the seasonal cycle and 0.58 with the seasonal cycle removed, indicating a general consistency in defining anomalous dusty periods in the North Atlantic. Model estimates of correlations between the dust index derived from TOMS AI and column desert dust suggest that the dust index is also representative of a large region of desert dust Figure 2b . The Barbados dataset has the advantage that data is available daily and represents mineral aerosol unambiguously, although it represents small spatial extent. The satellite data covers a larger spatial domain, but includes the impacts of all aerosols as well as interference from clouds and aerosol height. We will show results from the Barbados in situ surface concentration dataset, but the results do not change qualitatively if we showed the results using the regionally averaged TOMS AI instead.Mineral aerosol distribution. TOMS Absorbing Aerosol Index annual mean, showing the maximum plume over North Africa and the North Atlantic. Note that south of 15N contributions from biomass burning aerosols may be significant.‘Representativeness’ of dust indices.

The location of Barbados B and the averaging region box are shown on each plot. The positive correlation between cloud amount and mineral aerosols at the coast of North Africa in the low altitude liquid water clouds is consistent with the hypothesis that dust acts as a CCN and is acting to suppress precipitation in thin clouds. Because there are already sufficient CCN in the atmosphere, increasing the number of CCN, as occurs during desert dust outbreaks, will decrease the size of each individual cloud droplet, decreasing the chance of precipitation, thereby increasing the length of time a cloud persists and increasing the observed cloud amount. Note that these correlations are unfortunately also consistent with the misidentification of desert dust events as low altitude thin clouds. In addition, dust as represented by Barbados surface concentrations or TOMS AI may underestimate low level dust close to North Africa, and lead to errors in our correlations. As shown in Figure 4a , the region centered around 17N just off the west coast of North Africa has substantial amounts of low liquid clouds, and thus this is the area where we would expect to see the largest signal if mineral aerosols and water clouds were interacting.Cloud distributions. Annual mean ISCCP retrieved cloud amount for low thin clouds a and thin high cirrus clouds b .. In addition, there are positive anomalies in the Western North Atlantic between desert dust and ice phase clouds. These appear to be associated with a negative anomaly not statistically significant in these plots, but seen in Figure 3a suggesting that there is a shift in the location of ice phase clouds, although there may be a net increase in ice phase clouds.. The net effect of the addition of effective ice nuclei on cloud amount is not well understood. While the large-scale, long-term results presented here can only be tentative in their conclusions, in combination with available process based studies, they suggest that interactions between mineral aerosols and clouds may be climatically significant and should be further studied. The suppression of precipitation in low clouds close to the source areas also suggests that mineral aerosols may play a role in intensifying droughts such as observed over the Sahel since the 1960s. Potential feedbacks between mineral aerosols and clouds are especially important in the context of the observed 2–4-fold increase in mineral aerosols in the North Atlantic since the 1960s, which occurred for reasons which are poorly understood but may be related to human activities."
273,particles aerosol ocean,"Atmospheric input of mineral dust to the western North Pacific region based on direct measurements and a regional chemical transport model. [1] The spatial and temporal variation of the mineral aerosol concentration and its total deposition flux over the western North Pacific region were analyzed with a regional chemical transport model AQPMS for the period March 1994 through May 1995. Dry deposition accounted for more than 60% of the total deposition of Asian mineral dust throughout the period. The annual deposition flux was found to decrease rapidly from the coastal area 21 g m -2 yr -1 to the open ocean 0.8 g m -2 yr -1 over the study region. Sporadic dust deposition events over the HNLC region may increase the dissolved iron concentration in seawater and hence stimulate marine biological activity. The main eastward flow of mineral dust is located in the free troposphere between 30 and 40degreesN, above the layer of maximum concentration. These results support the intercontinental transport of Asian mineral dust across the North Pacific as background aerosol. . These natural and anthropogenic materials in the atmosphere can influence regional and global climates by altering the Earth's radiative balance. There are still large uncertainties in estimates of the emission flux, the distribution, and the radiative forcing of Asian mineral dust. The atmospheric deposition of aerosols containing iron and other essential trace elements may cause changes in the primary productivity of phytoplanktons, food web structure and the chemical composition of the marine atmosphere over the oceans. The estimated atmospheric input of mineral matter to the North Pacific 480 × 10 12 g yr −1 is much higher than that to the North Atlantic 220 × 10 12 g yr −1 . However, the most prominent large-scale region of elevated aerosol radiances derived from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner CZCS was observed off the coast of northwest Africa. According to a previously published map, marine biological activity is expected to be affected most greatly by atmospheric dust input in High-Nutrient Low-Chlorophyll HNLC regions, particularly in the northern North Pacific rather than other HNLC regions with less dust such as the equatorial Pacific and Southern Ocean. Here we attempt to estimate the atmospheric transport and input of mineral dust from the Asian continent to the western North Pacific with a regional chemical transport model based on measurements of the mineral aerosol concentration and total dust deposition on the Japanese islands... The local emissions of mineral dust from Japan were not taken into account in the simulation. Therefore, the simulated values show only the contribution of mineral dust from the Asian continent. A size-segregated particle dry deposition scheme and below-cloud scavenging scheme are used to treat aerosol removal by dry deposition and wet deposition. In this application, the model domain ranged from 75°E to 165°E and from 5°N to 60°N with horizontal 1-degree resolution. The vertical grid consists of 18 irregular levels from the surface to an altitude of 12 km. All meteorological data sets were obtained from NCEP. The boundary and initial conditions are the same as those used by . Pronounced spring peaks of the Al concentration were observed at these sites, although there were substantial background concentrations during the summer time. In the winter, the Al concentrations were low at both Sapporo and Niigata because the local soil contribution was minimum due to snow-covered ground and there was little dust transport by westerly winds from the Asian continent where mineral dust source regions were also frozen or snow covered. Anthropogenic Al e.g., fly ash may contribute to the samples. The annual dust deposition observed was 5.2 g m −2 yr −1 at the Sapporo site. The total deposition velocity was calculated to be 0.5 cm s −1 based on the annual deposition flux and the annual mean atmospheric dust concentration of 30 μg m −3 obtained by assuming 8% of mineral dust is Al. The atmospheric dust deposition fluxes observed in and around the Japan Sea and the North Pacific are summarized in Table 1 . The direct measurements of the annual dust fluxes in this study are in good agreement with the accumulated fluxes measured from records of fallen snow and oceanic sediments, which are slightly closer to the Asian mineral dust source regions than the Sapporo site. Sporadic dust events causing high dust concentrations and large dust depositions have been observed at several places over the Japan islands, but may occur on a smaller regional scale. From long term atmospheric measurements, the mean mineral dust concentration shows a clear spatial trend, with high concentrations at sites closer to source regions in the Asian continent decreasing exponentially to sites in the central North Pacific with a halving distance of 500–600 km.Unit is g m −2 yr −1 . Our regional model suggests that more than 60% of mineral dust was removed in this oceanic region by dry deposition throughout the year. For long-range transport, the air masses containing mineral dust are typically dry and are transported a great distance from the Asian continent by strong westerly winds above the marine boundary layer. In contrast, mineral dust events observed at ground level around the eastern coastal regions of Asia do not last long because there are greater chances of them being subjected to particle removal processes within the boundary layer, such as mixing and dilution with other air mass, interaction with marine aerosols, or collision with the earth's surface.. Vertical profiles of mineral dust layers have been measured by lidar and profiles of back scatter and depolarization ratio sometimes indicate dense layers of mineral dust particles. The altitudinal range of mineral dust transport over Japan has been observed to be from 2 to 6 km in most cases. However, the main horizontal flux of mineral dust associated with the peak concentration and wind speed may not be at the same altitude as the maximum concentrations obtained by lidar or by back trajectories based on mineral dust events at ground sites. The main eastward flow of mineral dust in the western North Pacific is located in the mid troposphere between 30 and 40°N, above the layer with the peak concentration. The region with a horizontal mineral dust flux of 70 μg m −2 s −1 is located between ground level and an altitude of 6.5 km at 120°E, 2.5–7 km at 150°E, and 4– 5 km at 165°E. These altitudinal changes of the main flow result from the gravitational settling of mineral dust particles from the dusty air masses. Numerical simulation using by AQPMS successfully reproduced the variation of the mineral aerosol concentration and its total deposition flux over Japan during the period from March 1994 to February 1995, particularly in the spring. Dry deposition is the dominant process removing the mineral dust particles over the western North Pacific region because there is little precipitation in the spring. The mean annual deposition flux of mineral dust originating from the Asian continent was calculated to be 2.7 g m −2 yr −1 . The total atmospheric input of mineral dust was estimated be 64 × 10 12 g yr −1 for the western North Pacific an area of 23.5 × 10 12 m 2 , covering 25% of the entire North Pacific Ocean.[17]  Several sporadic deposition events of mineral dust over the HNLC region during the spring 10–20 g m −2 period −1 will increase the dissolved iron concentration in surface seawater e.g., 0.3–0.6 nM increase in the 50 m-deep mixed layer during an event with 10% dissolution of iron in mineral particle , and this, in turn, stimulates the marine biological activity in the northwestern North Pacific.[18]  The main eastward flow of mineral dust in the western North Pacific is located in the mid troposphere between 30 and 40°N and above the layer of maximum concentration. Our results support the intercontinental transport of Asian mineral dust across the North Pacific and the North American continent. Therefore, Asian mineral dust particles are probably an important source as background aerosol of the free troposphere."
274,climate aerosol,"A study of the effect of non-spherical dust particles on the AVHRR aerosol optical thickness retrievals. Non-spherical assumption of particle shape has been used to replace the spherical assumption in the AVHRR aerosol optical thickness tau retrievals for dust particles. Retrieved tau with both spherical and non-spherical assumptions have been compared to the surface AERONET observations at two desert dust sites to evaluate and quantify the effect of non-spherical dust particles on the satellite aerosol retrievals. The errors especially the random error in the satellite retrieved t have been reduced as a result of adopting the non-spherical assumption in the NOAA/NESDIS AVHRR aerosol retrieval algorithm. This result suggests the importance of taking into account the effects of non-sphericity in the retrieval of dust particles from AVHRR measurements. . Compared to the climate effects of greenhouse gases, aerosol climate effects are more complex and with large uncertainties. This is because, unlike the long-lived greenhouse gases which are distributed uniformly over the globe , aerosols display substantial and temporal variations due to their short lifetimes a week or less and various natural and anthropogenic emission sources such as blowing dust, urban/industrial pollution, biomass burning, etc. . Satellite measurements supply a unique tool for observing the global aerosol distribution. However, the accuracy of satellite aerosol remote sensing is limited by the variable characteristics of aerosol particles in the atmosphere.. This is because most satellite aerosol retrieval algorithms including such advanced satellite imager instruments as MODIS and MISR are still based on the Mie theory for spherical particles. However, there are sufficient experimental and theoretical computational evidence that the non-sphericity of desert dust particles can produce scattering properties that are significantly different from those of spherical particles.. Also, some remote-sensing observations of dust-like aerosols seem to indicate lower importance of non-spherical scattering. Thus, it is worth to do more investigation on the non-sphericity issue of dust-like particles in satellite aerosol remote sensing. This issue is probably even more serious for the AVHRR type instruments with limited retrieval channels since a globally fixed aerosol model was normally assumed in most of the AVHRR aerosol optical thickness τ retrieval algorithms. This paper concentrates on studying the effect of non-spherical dust particles on the NOAA/NESDIS AVHRR aerosol retrieval algorithm through the validation against the surface AERONET observations.. Second, aerosol parameters optical thickness, size distributions, refractive indexes, and phase functions derived for the non-spherical dust particles from the Sun/sky radiance measurement are also available for us to use. Due to the well known AVHRR channel 2 0.83 μm defect of wide spectral band for the aerosol retrieval, we will concentrate our study on the AVHRR channel 1 0.63 μm retrieval. This decision is to avoid the retrieval error associated with the abnormal water vapor contamination on the AVHRR channel 2. The AVHRR τ retrievals with the spherical assumption have been optimized through the adjustment of the parameters including size distribution, refractive index, and surface reflectance in the retrieval algorithm. This optimization is to minimize the retrieval errors associated with aerosol size and types and the variability of ocean surface reflectance in the retrieval algorithm. Thus, the remaining effect on the retrieval from the aerosol shape should become prominent. by only adjusting the aerosol absorbing properties, surface reflectance, and calibration in the retrieval algorithm without considering the particle shape. We found out the improvement was almost impossible see more explanation below . One may notice the improvement at Cape Verde is more than at Bahrain. This is probably because using the typical phase function of dust particles in our retrieval algorithm will more representative at Cape Verde than at Bahrain since more pure dusts are over Cape Verde while the dust over Bahrain are often mixed with urban pollution.Scatter plots of match-up data at two AERONET desert dust sites Cape Verde and Bahrain for the aerosol optical thickness retrieved from the AVHRR 0.63 μm channel radiances with both spherical and non-spherical assumptions. Linear regression lines have also be displayed along with the regression parameters.−1 ω and P are aerosol single scattering albedo and phase function , the match-up points of the AVHRR retrievals displayed in Figure 1 should fall in the range of 90° < Θ < 150° in order to explain systematically lower τ values when non-spherical particles are assumed in the retrieval algorithm. a The typical phase functions of non-spherical particles derived from the AERONET measurement interpolated to the satellite retrieval channel and their counterparts of the spherical particles calculated from Mie theory at two AERONET desert dust sites of Cape Verde and Bahrain. For adequate display, we have multiplied the values at Bahrain by 10. b The difference ΔP Θ = P Θ non-sphere - P Θ sphere of the phase functions between spherical and non-spherical assumptions at the two sites for backward scattering directions scattering angle Θ > 100° .  . This is also explain why we almost cannot improve the random errors in our early validation works by only adjusting the aerosol absorbing properties, surface reflectance, and calibration in the retrieval algorithm without considering the particle shape. The non-spherical effect of dust particles is difficult to detect when the satellite observations fall in the range of scattering angles where the phase function difference between spherical and non-spherical particles is small.[13]  Non-spherical assumption has been used to replace spherical assumption in the AVHRR aerosol optical thickness retrievals for dust particles. Aerosol optical thickness τ retrieved with the assumptions of spherical and non-spherical particles have been validated against the surface AERONET observations at two desert dust sites to evaluate and quantify the effect of non-spherical dust particles on the AVHRR τ retrievals. Both the systematic error and random error the latter one is very difficult to reduce in the spherical assumption of the satellite τ retrievals have been reduced after the non-spherical assumption is adopted in the retrieval algorithm. The improvement is mainly due to the usage of proper phase function associated with non-spherical particles. This improvement in the validation results of dust particles indicates the importance of taking into account the effects of non-sphericity in the AVHRR aerosol retrieval algorithm."
275,aerosol,"Mineral dust sources in the surroundings of the north Indian Ocean. [ 1] We have used one year 1999 of Meteosat observations to monitor the dust activity in the arid and semi-arid areas surrounding the North Indian Ocean. The method is based on the IDDI product derived from the infrared channel of the satellite. Dust sources are located according to a threshold on the IDDI and another on the surface wind speed. The global features of the dust activity in this area are in a good agreement with previous studies. Main dust sources are located in the Nubian desert, the Arabian peninsula, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and North West India. It is found that Somalia is also an area of dust emission with a maximum of activity from May to October. , tropospheric chemical composition and also maritime biological processes as they provide ocean with trace metals such as iron. The assessment of the contribution of mineral dust to the aerosol burden requires an accurate knowledge of source location and intensity as well as transport and removal processes. derived from the infrared channel of the meteorological Meteosat has proven its ability to monitor the presence of mineral dust over continental areas.. A significant contribution of mineral dust originating from the surrounding deserts has been observed during the winter period. Thanks to the shift of Meteosat-5 from its original location to 63°E, we have obtained a one-year monitoring of dust sources from approximatively 35°N to the Equator and 30°E to 90°E. In this paper, we present an IDDI-based monitoring of the locations and seasonal variations of dust source activity in the arid and semi-arid areas surrounding the NIO. Because most dust updrafts occur during daytime, the IDDI is suitable for the monitoring of dust source areas. The observation corresponds actually to both recent dust updrafts and large scale transport of particles. However, due to the dilution of the dust plume in the atmosphere and the removal of particles during the transport, the highest dust content is generally observed close to its source region. In turn, the highest IDDI counts are close to source regions. IDDI above 25 counts corresponds to a reduction of the visibility to less than 1 km or to a dust optical thickness above 1 in the visible spectrum. Such conditions are typical of a fresh dust outbreak. In the following, we consider that pixels with IDDI value above 25 are located over an active source area. With such an assumption, the threshold method will miss local emission with low intensity. To prevent confusion with transport of high dust load, we have applied an extra threshold on the surface wind speed. The lowest wind velocity able to generate a dust event is 4 ms −1 . For a given IDDI daily image, a pixel is identified as a dust updraft pixel if its IDDI value is above 25 counts and the corresponding surface wind speed exceeds 4 ms −1 . The surface wind velocity is supplied by the European Center for Medium range Weather Forecast ECMWF analyses at 6:00 UT with a spatial resolution 1.125° × 1.125°. Each ECMWF surface wind velocity map is interpolated to match the IDDI map spatial resolution. The resolution of the ECMWF data lower than the IDDI data, will result in the omission of high wind speed events that are smoothed out in the climatological data. However, the threshold on the surface wind speed prevents to take into account high IDDI value which can be due to cloud contamination or to a decrease in the surface temperature resulting from heavy load of other type of aerosols as it is the case over populated areas. The global features of Figures 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d point out five majors dust emission areas: the Nubian desert in northeastern Africa, the Arabian peninsula, the west coast of Somalia, Iran and its eastern border with Afghanistan and Pakistan and northwestern India. In the following sections, we have used geographical information from the An intense area of dust activity is located along the border between Pakistan and India. During summer and autumn periods, a well-defined spot is centered over the Thar desert, in agreement with the results of Middleton  We can only monitor the eastern part of the Nubian desert from 30°E to the western shore of the Red Sea. The dust source spreads between 10° and 25°N and has a maximum activity during spring time. The activity is weaker in summer than in spring, and vanishingly weak during autumn and winter..Seasonal trend of the blacks bars number of dusty days and solid line windy days over South of Somalia. The gray bars correspond to the monthly rainfall.[16]  The North Indian Ocean is surrounded by several arid and semi-arid areas which are sources of atmospheric dust. The largest one is the Rub Al Khali desert in central Saudi Arabia. Several other sources are located in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and north-west India. Maximum of dust frequency occurs in the spring and summer months for most of the areas. Dust activity is also observed in many places over Somalia from May to October corresponding to the drying of shallow watercourses. The area located east of the Lake Rudolf is also a major dust source. The climate of Somalia is well known to have a high inter-annual variability leading to severe droughts or devastating floods. Further details concerning dust activity in Somalia will require long term monitoring of dust emission as well as ground truths which are particulary laking in this area."
276,dust aerosol,"Case study of a Chinese dust plume reaching the French Alps. [1] By combining reconstruction of airmass back-trajectories from dust deposition sites in Europe and measurements of the Nd isotopic composition of deposited dust particles, potential sources of different Saharan dust events can be identified. The study of ""red dust'' events collected in France allowed us to identify distinct North African source areas e.g. Lybia vs. Mauritania . Surprisingly, the airmass trajectory of one dust event March 6, 1990 was distinct from the others, and revealed a Chinese origin. The Nd isotopic composition of this dust was consistent with the range of isotopic compositions of Chinese loess. Moreover, an atmospheric global model simulation reveals that a dust plume left China before February 25, 1990, flew over North America around the February/March transition and reached the French Alps by March 6, 1990, revealing that intercontinental dust and pollutant transport may occur across the Pacific Ocean and the North Atlantic at the Westerlies latitudes. , sometimes reaching France and even southern England. These dusts can be easily sampled a few times a year in the French mountains – mostly in the Alps and the Pyrénées–where they suddenly cover snow surfaces with thin, red-to-brown blankets.. By comparison to the composition of samples from the potential source areas loess, sand dunes, etc , the location of a given dust source can be identified. Then, using archived meteorological data, it is possible, for a given fallout period, to reconstruct over a few days, the airmass backward trajectories responsible for the transport of these dusts, and then back to their source regions. This approach can be corroborated by satellite imagery e.g. TOMS for cloud-free areas. Finally, a global transport model driven by assimilated meteorology can be used to simulate dust deflation and long-range transport: it provides an independent constraint on the reconstruction of dust plume pathways. In this study, we have combined these three independent approaches for addressing the problem of the origin of the dusts collected in southern France.. We thus have a suite of tracers which are characteristic of the source area. It has been demonstrated that combining airmass trajectory reconstructions and geochemical studies, permits pinpointing quite precisely the source regions of different dust fallouts.. For each of those, the Nd isotopic composition of their carbonate-free fraction has been analyzed. The isotopic composition of Nd is usually defined by the 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratio, which, for convenience, is normalized and reported as follows: E Nd o = 143 Nd/ 144 Nd/0.512636 − 1 .10 4 . Precision of the E Nd o measurements is ≤ ± 0.2. In northern Africa, E Nd o ranges from radiogenic values E Nd o ≈ 0 in young volcanic areas to unradiogenic values E Nd o ≈ −20 such as those observed in the Mauritania Archean provinces. When comparing the data obtained on the particles sampled in Alpine and Pyrenean snows, to those of the isotopic composition of the different dust fields of North Africa, it appears that the dusts reveal generally a North African origin. Here we present two examples of dusts collected in southern France and clearly derived from North African sources Figure 1a . The following interpretations are based on both the dust isotopic composition and the reconstruction of airmass backward trajectories. We show two back-trajectories reaching the French Alps and Pyrénées from North Africa Figure 1a and another from East Asia Figure 1B . The Nd isotopic signature of the March 8, 1990, dust event reveals an unradiogenic composition E Nd o = −16.7 . Looking along its airmass pathway, it appears that such a negative value can only be found in the Mauritanian region. Now, if we consider the evolution of that airmass Figure 1a , dust deflation must have occurred from northern Mauritania 2-to-4 days prior to its arrival in France. On the same figure, the Nd isotopic signature of the March 25, 1991 dust event to the northeast reveals a slightly more radiogenic composition E Nd o = −14.7 . Considering the more easterly trajectory of its related airmass, this dust plume can only be linked to a Lybian source with similar negative values. a Back trajectories reconstructed using the NOAA ARL Website www.arl.noaa.gov/ready/ , CDC1 meteorological data. 1 trajectory ending at 06:00 UTC, on March 8, 1990  The Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation Transport GOCART model has been used to simulate dust distribution over the two last decades. Dust distribution is calculated by solving the continuity equation with four particle-size bins, from 0.1 to 6 μm. Dust is uplifted by winds from preferential sources which are associated with topographic lows. The model has a horizontal resolution of 2° latitude and 2.5° longitude and 20 vertical sigma layers from the surface to 1 mb ∼50 km above ground . All processes are driven by assimilated meteorological fields by the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System GEOS DAS . Figure 2 shows the dust concentration around 3 km altitude above sea-level from February 25 to March 7, every other day. Around February 20, the model indicates that a dust plume was emitted from the Takla-Makan desert >100 μg/m 3 . The plume was then transported eastward over the Pacific to North America. By the end of February, it reached the west coast of Canada, and had spread to the east coast by March 1. Subsequently it moved across the North Atlantic to reach England on March 5. On that day, the trailing edge of the Asian plume ≈10 μg/m 3 was connected with a Saharan dust plume such that the Asian plume preceded the Saharan plume over the Alps on the 7th. Over-plotted on the dust concentration in Figure 2 are the back-trajectories calculated from the shown day to March 6 using NOAA NCEP re-analysis. The airmass movement derived from the NOAA NCEP re-analysis is much faster than that of dust transported with GEOS DAS re-analysis used by GOCART. The difference starts to be obvious the days before March 1 and may be due to several factors: 1 poorly reliable back-trajectories for periods longer than 5 days, 2 the NCEP and GEOS DAS assimilation systems produce significantly different re-analyzed wind fields, or 3 the dust plume is transported at lower altitude, with slower winds, due to the gravitational settling. Despite this difference, they both show that the dust plume came from western China and crossed North America along or north of the US-Canada border. It is known that these dust events are associated with pollution heavy metal fallout. even as far as Greenland. In the same way, trans-Atlantic air pollution originating from Asia could also affect Europe. and that recent Chinese dust is deposited in northern Greenland. But, the fact that dust coming from Asia could reach Europe, has not previously been reported. Such intercontinental and transcontinental transport and the precise distinctions between source areas is important from the viewpoint of understanding the dust itself, but also from that of the heavy metal, fungal, bacterial and viral pollution that may be associated with it."
277,dust,"The transformation of solid atmospheric particles into liquid droplets through heterogeneous chemistry: Laboratory insights into the processing of calcium containing mineral dust aerosol in the troposphere. [1] Individual calcium carbonate particles reacted with gas-phase nitric acid at 293 K have been followed using Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM and Energy Dispersive X-Ray EDX analysis as a function of time and relative humidity RH . The rate of calcium carbonate to calcium nitrate conversion is significantly enhanced in the presence of water vapor. The SEM images clearly show that solid CaCO3 particles are converted to spherical droplets as the reaction proceeds. The process occurs through a two-step mechanism involving the conversion of calcium carbonate into calcium nitrate followed by the deliquescence of the calcium nitrate product. The change in phase of the particles and the significant reactivity of nitric acid and CaCO3 at low RH are a direct result of the deliquescence of the product at low RH. This is the first laboratory study to show the phase transformation of solid particles into liquid droplets through heterogeneous chemistry. . In the coming years, this value is predicted to increase because of the global expansion of arid regions. Fine mineral dust can be transported long distances in the atmosphere and thus have the potential to undergo a variety of heterogeneous reactions with atmospheric gases. In principle, it is possible that heterogeneous chemistry of atmospheric aerosol can change both the gas-phase chemical balance of the atmosphere and the physicochemical properties of individual particles. Changes in the properties of individual particles, such as size, shape, composition and hygroscopicity, will alter aerosol optical properties and thus may have an impact on the Earth's climate. The ways in which mineral dust aerosol impact atmospheric processes such as climate forcing, heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry and phase transitions of ammonium salts containing dust inclusions are just beginning to be understood.. In the study described here, the heterogeneous chemistry of individual calcium carbonate particles with nitric acid, a pervasive gas-phase species, to form calcium nitrate according to reaction R1 , is examined. The data show that the reactivity of nitric acid is significantly enhanced in the presence of water vapor. The data also show that solid particles of calcium carbonate are transformed into aqueous calcium nitrate droplets as the particles react. This process occurs in a two-step mechanism. The first step is shown in reaction R1 and the second step, which involves the deliquescence of the calcium nitrate product, is shown in reaction R2 , The conversion of solid particles into liquid droplets through heterogeneous chemistry has important atmospheric implications in terms of the continued reactivity of the aerosol and the impact of the reacted aerosol on climate. As shown here, single particle analysis can be used to determine changes in particle morphology, relative reaction rates and the extent of reaction of individual particles as a function of particle size.. The conclusion from this first set of experiments is that calcium carbonate particles exposed to nitric acid at low RH 17 ± 1% show a change in particle morphology as they react with nitric acid. For the smaller particles <∼1 μm , it appears that the particles are converted into aqueous droplets as the particles convert from calcium carbonate to calcium nitrate. The larger calcium carbonate particles show only slight morphology changes upon exposure to nitric acid. The change in morphology of the particles imaged in both sets of experiments is consistent with the conversion of solid calcium carbonate to aqueous calcium nitrate via the two-step mechanism reactions R1 and R2 discussed in the Introduction. The increase in particle size is consistent with the uptake of water by the particle to form an aqueous phase droplet. Our results agree well with levitation experiments done by [1999] estimate that, in areas of high relative humidity, hygroscopic particles will reflect light by a factor of 2.5 to 3 greater than dry particles. In polluted areas this substantial increase in the albedo can have significant impacts on local climate and on environmental incentives. Because the particles reflect the incident light, they have a net cooling effect, which in some locations can counteract global warming due to greenhouse gases. As shown here, dust particles consisting of calcium carbonate can react with nitric acid to form calcium nitrate, a highly hygroscopic salt. Thus reacted mineral dust that contains calcium carbonate can be expected to reflect light more than unreacted mineral. In addition, these reacted particles will be more effective cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere."
279,aerosol,"Combined use of satellite and surface observations to infer the imaginary part of refractive index of Saharan dust. We present a method for the retrieval of the imaginary part of refractive index of desert dust aerosol at near UV wavelengths. The method uses observations of radiances at 331 and 360 nm by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, and aerosol optical depth measurements by the Aerosol Robotic Network. The derived values of imaginary part of refractive index of Saharan dust aerosol at 360 nm are significantly lower than previously reported values. The average retrieved values vary between 0.0054 and 0.0066 for different geographical locations. The results reported in this work are in good agreement with the results of several recent investigations. . The correct modeling of dust radiative forcing as well as the development of aerosol remote sensing techniques require precise knowledge of the optical properties of mineral dust in a wide spectral range.. Recent remote sensing observations conclude that mineral dust is much less absorbing in the visible part of spectrum than previously assumed.  The issue of imaginary part of dust refractive index in the near UV has recently been addressed.

The method was applied to the combination of TOMS and AERONET measurements over four AERONET sites, which are dust-dominated locations. The retrieved values of imaginary part of refractive index of dust aerosols are found to be lower than the value reported by [1977] ."
280,aerosol,"The spectral radiative signature of wind-blown mineral dust: Implications for remote sensing in the thermal IR region. [1] This study investigates how the loading and composition of atmospheric dust affect IR radiances observed by satellite narrowband and high-resolution sensors. To compute monochromatic radiances accounting for multiple scattering and absorption by aerosols and atmospheric gases, we employed a new radiative transfer code which combines the line-by-line algorithm and discrete ordinate technique. New dust optical models required for such computations were developed for the representative mineral mixtures. We demonstrate that dust decreases the brightness temperature observed by satellite sensors depending mainly on the dust burden and composition, though the sensitivity to the composition differs between the satellite sensors. We found that mineral dust has a unique radiative signature termed here a ""negative slope'' which separates the effect of dust from that of clouds and gases. We conclude that dust must be accounted for in atmospheric correction algorithms if the retrievals of the sea surface temperature and atmospheric gaseous species from the thermal IR radiances are to be of high accuracy. . For instance, Ackerman . The DISORT code is used to solve the radiative transfer equation with multiple scattering. HITRAN-96 database was used to provide the line parameter input for line-by-line calculations. The HITRAN database consists of about million lines of 36 atmospheric gaseous species, which all were included in our calculations. The vertical profile of gaseous species and structure of the atmosphere temperature, pressure, density as a function of altitude were taken from the standard atmospheric models. In particular, we considered several atmospheric models e.g., Tropic and U.S. 1976 to cover the range of atmospheric conditions in the regions frequently affected by dust transport. Calculations of monochromatic radiances require high spectral resolution aerosol models in the IR region. Although basic physics of absorption and scattering by particulate matter is well understood, the quantitative prediction of aerosol effects in the IR remains an unresolved issue. In particular, we are not aware of any aerosol model specifically designed for high spectral resolution remote sensing.. Since atmospheric dust is a mixture of various mineral species, it is critical to account for its composition. Following the approach described by Sokolik and Toon . These compositional mixtures result in distinct spectral optical characteristics in the IR spectral region. The presence of dust decreases the brightness temperature in all narrowband channels. This decrease is largely controlled by the dust loading. However, some channels are more sensitive to the dust composition than the others. In particular, the MODIS 8.4–8.7 μm channel is extremely sensitive to dust composition because this range of wavelengths partly covers the main absorbing bands of clays and quartz. The magnitude of the negative slope is not too sensitive to dust composition and thus can be used to retrieve the dust optical depth in this spectral region. In contrast, the region about 1099–1220 cm −1 8.2–9.1 μm is very sensitive to dust composition and can provide important constrains on dust mixtures. Thus, the high spectral resolution remote sensing provides the unique capability in characterizing the properties of wind-blown atmospheric dust. In this paper we estimated the effect of atmospheric mineral dust on the IR radiances observed by the narrowband and high-resolution sensors. We demonstrated that the presence of dust decreases the brightness temperature depending mainly on the dust loading, though the composition becomes important as the loading increases. The moderate dust loading can result in a decrease of brightness temperature by 5–10 K in the IR window over the oceans. Given the SST desirable accuracy of about 0.2 K, even the light dust loading can causes non negligible errors..[19]  We conclude that narrowband satellite sensors are capable of detecting dust but the quantitative characterization of dust properties requires a higher spectral resolution. The potential of high spectral resolution remote sensing in providing compositional information is especially important since no other means of remote sensing from space are capable of providing such data.[20]  In turn, dust must be included in atmospheric correction algorithms if the retrievals of the sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor and trace gases from the thermal and near IR radiances are to be of high accuracy.[21]  An additional analysis will be required to demonstrate whether a dust spectral signal can be uniquely identified from the measurements over the land, because the spectral emissivity of various surfaces can mask the dust effect on the TOA radiances."
283,aerosol ocean,"Nitrate anomaly in the upper nutricline in the northern South China Sea - Evidence for nitrogen fixation. [1] Up to 2 muM of nitrate anomaly, N*, were found in the upper nutricline at the South East Asia Time-series Study SEATS site in the northern South China Sea SCS . These concentrations were among the higher values reported in the Pacific and indicate the significant contribution of the remineralization of nitrogen-rich organic matter formed by nitrogen fixation to the nutrient dynamics of the area. The concentrations were systematically higher, by up to 2.5 muM, in the Fall through the early Spring, during the northeast monsoon, than in the Summer, suggesting that the impact of nitrogen fixation was higher during the former time period. This pattern is in phase with that of the atmospheric deposition of Asian dust to the northern SCS. The coherence is consistent with a coupling between nitrogen fixation and the availability of atmospherically derived iron. . Nitrogen fixation has long been proposed as a dominant allochthonous source of combined nitrogen to the ocean. Yet it is still not well understood or quantified as its episodic nature poses severe constraints on direct observations. The environmental conditions that are conducive to the occurrence of nitrogen fixation are: a water temperature exceeding 20°C, the absence of inorganic combined nitrogen, a stratified water column and the availability of iron. All four conditions are met in the northern South China Sea SCS so that it should be a preferred site for nitrogen fixation. Indeed, among the small number of measurements of the rates of nitrogen fixation in the world oceans, the rates found in the SCS were among the higher values reported. Nonetheless, while the first three conditions are met year-round, the input of iron, through the atmospheric deposition of dust, to the SCS is not uniform through the year although the annual flux is among the highest to oligotrophic waters. The depositions occur primarily from the Fall through the early Spring during the northeast monsoon and are sparse during the southwest monsoon in the Summer. Thus, if the availability of iron is the controlling factor for nitrogen fixation in the northern SCS, the intensity of the process may vary temporally.. Its subsequent remineralization in the nutricline results in a nitrate anomaly which integrates the effect of nitrogen fixation over time, averages out the episodic signal and can then be used as an indicator of this process. The South East Asia Time-series Study SEATS in the northern SCS was initiated by the National Center for Ocean Research of Taiwan in September 1998 and the station has been maintained since September 1999. Here, we report evidence for nitrogen fixation at the SEATS site from the nitrate anomaly in its upper nutricline.. Phosphate was determined manually with the standard molybdenum blue method. The precisions for the determinations of nitrite, N + N and phosphate were ±0.03, ±0.3 and ±0.01 μM, respectively.The location of the South East Asia Time-series Study SEATS station S1. B - Bashi Channel; L - Luzon Strait; T - Taiwan. The relationships between potential temperature and salinity Figure 2a were typical of those observed previously in the northern SCS. The Tropical Water and the Intermediate Water were represented as a salinity maximum S > 34.6; σ θ ≈ 25.2 at around 150 m and a salinity minimum S ≈ 34.4; σ θ ≈ 26.8 at around 500 m. Below 15°C, which corresponded to a depth of about 200 m, the relationships were indistinguishable from each other through the year, indicating that seasonal effects on the hydrography were confined to the top 200 m of the water column. The profiles of potential temperature in the top 300 m Figure 3b indicated the expected seasonal pattern of Summer heating and Winter cooling in the surface waters. The surface temperature was at a maximum of 28°C in July and it dropped systematically to a minimum of 24°C in January before it rebounded in March. The mixed layer was about 30 m thick in July. It thickened progressively to 100 m in January before it thinned again. a The relationship between potential temperature Pot. Temp. and salinity at the SEATS site, and b the vertical distributions of potential temperature in the top 300 m. :: - 9/1999; long dash - 11/1999; medium dash - 1/2000; short dash - 3/2000; … - 5/2000; :_.:_ - 7/2000.The vertical distributions of N + N :: and phosphate --- in September, 1999, and N* • - 9/1999; ○ - 11/1999; ▴ - 3/2000; ▵ - 5/2000; ▪ - 7/2000 . In the normal biological pump, remineralization leads to the release of N + N and phosphate to the water column in a molar ratio of 16:1. The remineralization of nitrogen-rich organic matter formed by nitrogen fixation elevates while denitrification reduces this ratio. Nitrate anomaly, N*, is defined as: where N and P are the concentrations of N + N and phosphate. Aside from the effects of mixing, N* represents the deviation from the normal biological pump as a result of the sum of the effects of denitrification and nitrogen fixation. The constant of 2.90 μM is the global average deficit of nitrate resulted from denitrification. Thus, the global average N* is assumed to be 0 and N* is a relative value, with a more positive value indicating a more dominant effect of nitrogen fixation over denitrification. Concentrations of N* at St. S1 were computed in samples where the concentrations of N + N and phosphate exceeded 1 and 0.1 μM respectively. At lower concentrations, the estimated values of N* were too uncertain to be meaningful. Based on the analytical uncertainties in the determinations of N + N and phosphate, the uncertainty of N* was estimated to be ±0.5 μM. Another indication of the uncertainty is the variations in N* in the deep waters where it should have remained constant. Below 2000 m, the average concentration of N* during the sampling period was −3.4 ± 0.4 μM. Thus, both approaches estimated similar uncertainty. Nonetheless, the data from September and November were consistently higher than those from March, May and July Figure 3 . The average difference between these two subsets of data was about 0.7 μM. The variations in N* at a given depth in the deep water was caused primarily by this systematic offset. Within each subset, the data were highly coherent and the average deviation from the mean was ±0.2 μM. Thus, concentration differences exceeding 0.2 μM within each subset and exceeding 0.7 μM between the two subsets would indicate real temporal changes.. These elevated concentrations of N* were found in close proximity to the primary nitrite maximum, which associates with nitrification, and the δ 15 N minimum, which is indicative of the remineralization of 15 N-poor organic matter formed by nitrogen fixation, observed at about the same location in April, 1997 Figure 4 . Linear regression analyses of the relationships between N + N and phosphate for all data points below 150 m yielded N:P molar ratios of 13.4–14.7 average = 14.0 ± 0.6 . However, when the data points in the upper nutricline 150 to 500 m and below 500 m were treated separately, the ratios were invariably higher in the former 13.5–15.8; average = 14.5±0.8 than in the latter 11.2–13.5; average = 12.2±0.7 in each cruise. The elevated N:P ratio in the upper nutricline is also consistent with the suggestion that the remineralization of nitrogen-rich organic matter formed by nitrogen fixation is an important contributor to the nutrient dynamics of the northern SCS. Any preferential regeneration of nutrients during the early stage of remineralization would favor phosphate over nitrate and lead to low rather than high N* in the upper nutricline. Below the upper nutricline, N* decreased rapidly with depth to −3 μM at 1000 m at the bottom of the nutricline, and then more gradually to −3.5 μM at 2500 m. Both the shape of the profiles and the concentrations found were similar to those reported in the northwestern Subtropical Pacific.. While the database is limited, the distributions of N* reported by . The concentration of mineral dusts over the SCS is also lower in the Summer and higher between the Fall and the early Spring. The coherence between these two patterns supports the hypothesis that nitrogen fixation in the northern SCS is triggered by the availability of iron that originates from the atmospheric deposition of Asian dust.The relationship between N* and potential density. Symbols - same as in Figure 3 . could result in lower N* and contribute to this higher variability. In the deeper zone between the Tropical Water and the Intermediate Water 25.2 < σ θ < 26.8; 150 to 500 m , the release of phosphate and nitrate should be more tightly coupled and the concentrations were indeed less variable."
284,dust impact climate aerosol,"Dust deposition and provenance at the Last Glacial Maximum and present day. Ice and ocean core data suggest an increase in atmospheric dust loading at the Last Glacial Maximum, 21,000 years ago, relative to the present day. We present results from a new dust model; in contrast to previous modelling studies, we correctly simulate the observed provenance data in both Antarctica and Greenland, and obtain reasonable agreement with the dust deposition data. The observed increases are attributable to decreases in vegetation, increased surface wind strength, and increased particle lifetime due to the drier LGM climate . The Patagonian provenance of Antarctic LGM dust is linked to a decrease in soil moisture and an extension in area of the source region, and a high transport efficiency between the two regions. The results show a high degree of interannual variability, which must be taken into account when interpreting previous modelling results. , but many uncertainties remain, due mainly to poorly observed optical properties and dust distributions. The IPCC estimates the net forcing at the top of the atmosphere, due to mineral dust, to be in the range −0.6Wm −2 to +0.4Wm −2 . Indirect effects, such as the influence of dust on marine productivity in iron-deficient oceans and the effects of dust particles on clouds, are even less well understood, but are possibly significant. and vegetation cover. Similarly, changes in the atmospheric circulation and deposition processes both wet and dry may also play an important role in determining dust concentrations and deposition. and ocean-core data. In particular, the records point to a global increase in dust deposition at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum LGM , 21,000 years ago, relative to the present day. failed to simulate correctly the large increases seen in the Antarctic ice-core record, and were also in disagreement with mineralogical analysis, which points to a Patagonian provenance origin of Antarctic dust, and an Asian provenance of Greenland dust. More recently, sea surface temperatures which are known to be in error, especially in the tropics  In order to investigate these issues further, we have developed a new dust model, forced by a GCM coupled to a slab ocean, which we use to produce climatologies based on a 10 year average of dust concentration and deposition, for snapshot climate simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum and present day. We analyse the results in terms of the provenance as well as the amount of deposition, and emphasise the reasons for the differences between the two integrations., which includes parameterisation of sub-gridscale transport by turbulence and convection. For the work presented here, the present day and LGM fields which force the dust model are output from the Hadley Centre slab ocean General Circulation Model GCM , HadSM3, at a temporal resolution of 6 hours. The boundary conditions which constrain the present day and LGM GCM simulations conform to the PMIP standard. The spatial resolution of both the GCM and dust model is 3.75° in longitude, 2.5° in latitude, and 19 vertical levels. The present day, atmosphere-only version of the GCM has been extensively tested, and the model climatology agrees well with observations. A brief resumé of the dust model's source and sink parameterisations is presented here. A more detailed description can be found in . The high Patagonian contribution over Antarctica at the LGM can be attributed to a number of factors. Compared to the present day, the soil is less moist, and coupled with this, there is an increase in source area. These emissions are still less than those from Australia, but the dust transport to Antarctica is more efficient from Patagonia than from Australia. This is in agreement with trajectory analysis of continental transport towards Antarctica. Sensitivity studies show that the Patagonian source strength is very sensitive to the way in which the effects of soil moisture are parameterised. Using a different soil moisture parameterisation, the simulated emissions from Patagonia are greatly decreased, and dust from this region no longer dominates over Antarctica.Modelled percentage of deposited LGM dust which originates from either Patagonian or Asian deserts.[18]  In conclusion, the dust model simulates an increase in atmospheric dust loading at the LGM of 45% of the present day value. Globally, this increase is attributable to decreased vegetation, increased winds, and a decrease in precipitation, leading to a longer lifetime of dust; however, reasons for the changes are different in different regions.[19]  Compared to data from DIRTMAP, the model performs reasonably well, but somewhat underestimates the large increases in dust deposition over Antarctica. Compared to mineralogical observations, the model performs very well, supporting the evidence for a Patagonian origin of Antarctic dust, and an Asian origin of Greenland dust. The Patagonian origin of Antarctic dust can be attributed to a high transport efficiency between the two regions, and a relatively dry LGM soil."
285,particles aerosol clouds impact,"Treating clouds with a grain of salt. [1] High concentrations of small atmospheric aerosols are known to reduce the size of cloud droplets, increase cloud albedo and suppress precipitation formation. In contrast, cloud simulations suggest that even low concentrations of large soluble aerosols should promote droplets' growth and rainfall. Until now, though, no observational evidence of such microphysical effects in natural circumstance over land has been presented. By using NOAA-AVHRR retrievals on cases where salt-dust from the Aral Sea interacts with clouds we show that large salt-containing dust particles increase cloud drops to sizes that promote precipitation. These findings are in line with the findings of the microphysical models and recent results from hygroscopic cloud seeding experiments for rain enhancement. , increase cloud albedo and suppress precipitation. Cloud microphysical simulations, however, suggest that the presence of large soluble aerosols should induce opposite effects on clouds, namely increase droplets growth and promote precipitation formation. These models conclude that while drizzle production decreases with increasing cloud condensation nuclei CCN concentration, the relative impact of giant CCN GCCN increases with increasing CCN concentration, implying that the strongest effects of introducing giant CCN occur when the background concentration of small nuclei is high, as that in continental clouds. and advertent hygroscopic cloud seeding. Most observations until now showed that continental aerosols largely suppress cloud droplets' growth. Salt-dust storms from the dry seabed of the desiccated Aral Sea provide the opportunity to show that natural salt-containing aerosols increase cloud drop sizes and enhance precipitation-forming processes on large continental scale. This has been recently observed also over land when sea salt aerosols interact with polluted air from continental origin.. As a result, the fragile and mobile surface at the central eastern shores of the dried sea became an active source for massive salt-containing dust storms reaching the height of 1200-m above ground. The salt content of the dust is 30–40% in summer and close to 90% in winter. The dust also interacts with rain-producing systems, and the rainwater salinity in the region increased from 50 ± 20 mg/l measured in the 1960's up to 180 mg/l in the mid 1990's.NOAA -AVHRR satellite image 11 May 1998 09:32 UT showing clouds forming in salt-dust plumes off the eastern shores of the Aral Sea frames 2 and 3 . Clouds outside the dust storm are shown in frames 1 and 4. The visible channel modulates the red, the 3.7 μm reflectance component modulates the green, and the temperature modulates the blue. Therefore, clouds with large droplet sizes appear in red while yellow clouds have smaller droplet sizes. The dust is the intense yellow blur. The warm and dark surface background appears in blue. In addition to showing the microphysical effects of salt dust on clouds, the figure exemplifies the extent of the Aral Sea shrinking The black outline of the coastline is from 1980, and the actual 1998 coastline .. The soil of the desiccated sea bottom is dominated by silt 2–50 μm diameter and fine sand 50–200 μm diameter , with a very low organic carbon content, less than 10% CaCO 3 and between 50 to 65% soluble salts. Chlorine and sulfate are the dominant anions of these soluble salts, with 5–10 μm crystallites. The size distribution of the dry salt-dust by % volume of the dust sample has a maximum at 3.8–6 μm, depending on the amount of salt in the soil and is shown in Figure 2 . The distribution extends down to 0.05 μm and up to 30 μm in particle diameter. The PM 10 and PM 2.5 yield of the samples are ∼70% and ∼35%, respectively.Size distributions of dust generated from two dry soil samples with different salt content collected from the dried seabed of the Aral Sea. The values on the ordinate are the percent of the original sample.. The results are presented quantitatively in T-r e graphs in which satellite-retrieved effective radii r e of the cloud droplets are shown as a function of the cloud top temperature, which serves as a surrogate for cloud top height. The interaction between the clouds and the salt-dust in Figure 1 is clearly observed, and the effect is very conspicuous. The impact of 24 to 36 hours long-range transport of the salt-dust on developing clouds is still apparent, but to a lesser extent, in a different case shown in Figure 4 . According to low-altitude <1000 meters back-trajectory calculations using the NOAA-HYSPLIT4 model, HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model, 1997. Web address: http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ready/hysplit4.html , NOAA/ARL, Silver Spring, MD. , the sub-cloud air flows from the central and northern shores of the Aral Sea to areas 3, 4, and 10–11 in Figure 4 . The clouds in areas 1,2,5–8,14 and 15 formed in dust-free air according to the back trajectories. The clouds in areas 9, 12 and 13 are partially affected by the dust. The clouds in these areas have small r e near their base, which increases steeply with cloud depth the T-r e plots are shown in Figure 5 , but not as steeply as the clouds that feed directly from the heavily concentrated dust shown in Figure 1 . The inferred dust is present at concentrations too low to be visibly observed. Back trajectory simulations for these clouds show that the air mass originated in the central eastern shores of the Aral Sea about 24 hours earlier Figure 4 , yellow lines , coinciding with a large dust storm that is clearly observed by satellite a day earlier. Ground observations from meteorological stations in Chimbay, Uzbekistan 42.57°N, 59.47°E , situated south of the Aral Sea, also reported several intense dust storms on both July 4 and 5, 1997, overlapping in time with the back trajectories These observations provide insight to the effect of the salt-dust on cloud microphysics. Here we encounter a case where visibly high concentrations of large and soluble particles >0.3 μm diameter with high salt content are present. Figure 3 shows that under conditions of heavy salt-dust loading areas 2 and 3 r e is small near cloud base r e < 8 μm, T = 0–2°C . However, r e grows rapidly with height to more than 14-μm, the precipitation threshold, at the −10°C isotherm level. Clouds that develop far downwind of the salt source apparently ingest cleaner air containing less salt-dust, but still show the same increase of r e with depth lines 3, 4, and 9–13 in Figure 4 compared to the background clouds. The near-cloud-base r e is larger than that of the background clouds, in contrast to the clouds in the concentrated salt dust.. The numerous ∼0.5-μm salt particles can nucleate cloud drops already at supersaturation <0.05%, yielding large concentrations of cloud drops at near-cloud base, in spite of the presence of the very large salt particles that reduce the supersaturation. Cloud microphysical modeling studies already noted that the presence of a few large and giant CCN can promote raindrops formation, and that the effect is larger for continental clouds. The giant and ultra giant CCN are activated at much lower supersaturation than the smaller particles and they grow more efficiently at the expense of the smaller droplets by diffusion and by efficient collision-coalescence well above cloud base. Subsequently r e exceed the 14-μm precipitation threshold and rain drops can form Figure 1 , areas 2,3 .. This leads to lower concentrations and larger sizes of cloud base droplets, followed by enhanced coalescence at warm temperatures, as evident in areas 3,4 and 9–13 in Figure 4 and 5 . Rain will develop through broadening of the droplet spectrum into drizzle, as opposed to the formation of rain drops on ultra-giant CCN without the general broadening of the droplet spectrum. and other aerosols but rather promote their growth. In the Saharan dust case studies, the ambient aerosol contained only small amounts of soluble material and most of the aerosols were in the submicron size range. In the case of the Aral dust storms, the opposite observed effect is attributed to the presence of large and highly soluble aerosols. apparently replicate what nature already does on its own on a large scale."
288,ocean,"Impact of high Saharan dust inputs on dissolved iron concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea. [1] During the PROSOPE cruise Sept. 1999 in the Mediterranean Sea, dissolved iron concentrations in seawater and iron and aluminium concentrations in aerosols collected on board were investigated. Concentrations in aerosols were about two times higher in the Tyrrhenian Sea than in the west Alboran Sea . This was in good agreement with the observed increase in dissolved iron concentrations in the surface waters from West to East. Depth profiles were characterised by a maximum in the surface mixed layer. Using an in vitro experiment, iron released from Saharan dust during the season characterized by a stratified water column and a low primary productivity was estimated: it resulted in an accumulation of 0.5-0.8 nM dissolved iron, in good agreement with the observed iron enrichment in the surface water 0.8 nM . This study confirms the significance of atmospheric input of Saharan origin on the iron cycle in the Mediterranean Sea.  and is a major source of elements of biogeochemical importance such as iron Fe . Indeed in the Western Mediterranean, Fe associated with Saharan dust represents 96% of the total atmospheric flux of Fe and Saharan dust is the main source of dissolved iron. During the period of water column stratification in this area June–October , the strong stratification and the low surface production may allow atmospheric iron to accumulate in the surface mixed layer. In contrast, after the spring bloom of phytoplankton, and in the absence of any Saharan dust input, the surface mixed layer can become Fe-depleted, with concentrations lower than 0.1 nM. Aerosol sampling was performed while the ship was underway while exhaust fumes were not blowing across the sampler to avoid any contamination. A small volume pump Reciprotor AB, Sweden was connected to a polycarbonate filter holder Sartorius installed at the front of the ship fourteen meters above sea level. Nuclepore filters 0.4-μm pore diameter, 47 mm were installed removed on from the filter holder inside the clean container. Collected air volume varying between 14 and 25 m 3 .. Calibration curves were performed using known iron additions in oceanic samples with low iron concentrations that were below the detection limit . The detection limit 3 standard deviations of 10 replicates of blank was 0.14 nM. Accuracy of the method was assessed using the international reference material: NASS-5 North Atlantic Surface Seawater, National Research Council of Canada : 3.69 ± 0.62 nM certified value, 3.60 ± 0.04 nM determined.. Various amounts of Saharan soil were introduced into ultra-pure water in order to mimic dissolution processes occurring during a Saharan dust event. The experiment is fully described in ,. The strong stratification and the low surface production should allow the atmospheric input of dissolved iron to accumulate in the mixed layer. while a total dust flux of 5.9 t km −2 was recorded in Corsica Loÿe-Pilot, pers. com . Considering that the Saharan dust is characterised by a total iron concentration of 4.5%, the Saharan source represented, from June to end of September, a total iron flux of 193 × 10 4 − 475 × 10 4 nmol.m −2 . During the considered period, all dust deposition came with wet deposition with a high proportion of events with no measurable rainfall. The calculated from the dissolution law dissolution percentage in rains with measurable rainfall ranged from 0.05% to 0.3%. The total amount of dissolved iron released was then calculated by summing the estimated amounts of dissolved iron carried by individual events. For the events with no measurable rainfall, the dissolution in rainwater can be considered as negligible and the main dissolution process will occur in seawater. Because more than 60 to ∼90% of these particles have a median diameter below 1 μm, the residence time, of these particles, in the surface layer is long. Based on Stokes law, the sedimentation rate of the mineral particles in seawater can be computed as a function of particle size: a size-fraction lower than 1 μm settle at rates ≤5 cm day −1 . Consequently, these fine particles will accumulate in the surface layer during the entire stratified period while dissolution processes occur. The dust flux mg m −2 actually measured for each of these events has been assumed to disperse over the upper 15–20 m surface layer; from the corresponding particle concentration in seawater in mg l −1 , the percentage of dissolution was deduced from the logarithmic law section 3.2 . The obtained dissolution percentage ranged from 0.4 to 0.6%. for crustal aerosol. It is one order of magnitude higher than the previous estimation of Guieu and Thomas  The total dissolved concentration from atmospheric input that is predicted to accumulate in the surface mixed layer 15–20 m was then calculated as the sum of the iron released in rainwater and in seawater: it varied between 0.5 and 0.8 nM.[24]  This calculation is an upper limit, as it assumes that the residence time of iron is longer than the oligotrophic period and because we consider negligible effects of phytoplankton uptake, scavenging and physical mixing in the surface mixed layer during this period.[25]  This estimation is in good agreement with the observed dissolved iron accumulation 0.8 nM and supports the atmospheric origin from Sahara of the iron enrichment observed in the Mediterranean Surface Water.[26]  The other important feature of the iron profiles at DYFAMED and MIO stations is the deep iron maximum related to the occurrence of the LIW. The LIW results from sinking of Mediterranean Surface Water in the eastern part of the basin. The LIW flows back to the west at intermediate depths. The deep iron maximum may be the fingerprint of the surface origin of the water masses, which is consistent with the deepening of the maximum between MIO and DYFAMED.[27]  This study confirms the significance of the atmospheric input of dust of Saharan origin on the iron cycle in the Mediterranean Sea. Further investigations are currently in progress with regard to the impact of these inputs on the biological functioning of the Mediterranean Sea, in particular during the season characterized by a stratified water column and low primary productivity."
287,dust climate,"Satellite retrieval of aerosol absorption over the oceans using sunglint. [1] Aerosol absorption of sunlight, in particular by black carbon - soot and dark organic material produced from incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and from vegetation fires, is emerging as a key component of climate forcing. However, global characterization of black carbon emissions, distribution and absorption of sunlight cannot be determined within a factor of 5. Here we propose that the oceanic sunglint can be used as a bright background against which aerosol absorption can be measured from space. The method can map global ocean glint every 4-10 days and determine the distribution of aerosol absorption optical thickness with an error of +/-25% for aerosol optical thickness of 0.2 to 0.4. 18% of the ocean observations are for this range of optical thicknesses. The monthly average aerosol absorption is estimated to have an error of +/-12% and uncertainty in the single scattering albedo of +/-0.02. We outline a satellite design to perform the measurements. , or up to a third of greenhouse warming. and pollution over East and South Asia. Over the Indian Ocean BC was shown to absorb on average 7% of sunlight reaching the surface, or 17 W/m 2 . Such reduction of solar energy absorbed by the surface is expected to slow down the hydrological cycle and reduce cloud formation. BC from East Asia can be transported long distances from the source.. In the last 40 years its industrial/urban sources probably have tripled. Similar increases may be expected in the next decades due to the expansion of economic activity in East and South Asia.. Absorbing aerosols are also measured by UV space instruments TOMS, GOME , however analyis of the UV data is less sensitive to aerosol close to the surface and suffers from cloud contamination in the present satellite resolution of 50–90 kms.. Since oceans cover about two thirds of the globe this method would significantly increase our ability to provide a global assessment of the role of aerosol absorption and BC in climate.. Thus, in order to account for the glint reflection at least one spectral channel with no or low aerosol absorption is needed.. Therefore satellite measurements of the glint at 0.86 μm are not influenced by dust absorption and can be used to derive dust absorption in shorter wavelengths. Smoke or pollution aerosols are dominated by fine particles with AOT that decreases steeply with wavelength. Aerosol absorption is 3 to 6 times smaller at 2.13 μm than at 0.4–0.6 μm. Therefore the 2.13 μm is the best wavelength to detect the glint reflectance in the presence of smoke or pollution aerosols. The aerosol reflectance is sensitive to aerosol absorption in the glint while at off glint angles it is sensitive to aerosol size distribution and real part of refractive index. A change in the effective radius, Δr eff = 0.05 μm or a change in the refractive index, Δn r = 0.05, affects the aerosol reflectance outside the glint, as much as a change in the aerosol absorption optical thickness, Δτ abs = 0.03 see Figure 1 . However, the aerosol reflectance inside the glint is not sensitive to aerosol size or refractive index in this case. This insensitivity is due to the compensation between a change in the attenuation of the glint brightness and a change in aerosol backscattering of sunlight to space. This compensation may not take place for much different wind speeds or aerosol size distributions. , called here POL 1 and POL 2 . Polarization measurements from space are shown to provide accurate aerosol scattering optical properties when a wide range of view directions is available. In the Figure 2 configuration, POL 1 points always to the center of the glint and scans through it, POL 2 scans at 40° from the glint to see the same spot a minute apart at an off-glint direction. Aerosol properties are derived in the following method: Single scattering albedo, ω 0 at 0.55 μm as a function of the absorption function A for fine mode aerosols with optical thickness of 0.2 and 0.4, effective radius of R eff = 0.15 μm, real refractive index of n r = 1.40 and ω 0 at 2.1 μm of ω 0 2.1 = 1.0. The sensitivity to R eff = 0.2, n r = 1.45 and to ω 0 2.1 = 0.79, is shown. Single scattering albedo has a strong dependence on the absorption function A but also on other aerosol properties. An accurate determination of optical depth, effective radius, and refractive index with the off-glint geometry and polarization can narrow down the uncertainties in the absorption measurement. The spectral analysis of Table 1 is for the center of the glint. Similar uncertainty in the aerosol properties can be reached over a swath of 550 km corresponding to global coverage in 4 days. The calculations are for solar zenith angle of θ o = 30°. Similar results are obtained for θ o < 30°. However for θ o ∼60° the glint region is significantly narrower. Therefore, the best analysis of aerosol absorption can be obtained for θ o < 45° corresponding to a 90° latitude wide band varying seasonally with the solar position. The calibration accuracy used in Table 1 can be achieved by continuous intercomparison with AERONET measurements of aerosol absorption over clean oceanic sites absorption of τ abs ∼0.004 and a similar uncertainty in the absorption of Δτ abs ∼0.004 . The error of ΔH = ± 1 km may be reduced by estimating the aerosol height using UV polarization measurements.[16]  A new measurement strategy for the assessment of absorption by BC aerosol is presented for a hypothetical space mission. This strategy uses near simultaneous spectral polarimetric measurements of the ocean sun glint and off glint regions. It offers the possibility to observe fine aerosol absorption of sunlight over oceans and inland waters with errors of ±25% for individual observations and ±12% monthly average. Using a 550 km wide instrument swath, typical of a pushbroom sensor, that scans across the satellite track, the satellite, flying in polar sun synchronous orbit near 700km could provide global coverage in 4 days.[17]  This accuracy of the aerosol sun-glint measurement has been calculated for moderate wind speeds ∼7m/s and for low solar zenith angles e.g.< 45° . The method is not as good for high ≥10m/s or low ≤3m/s wind speeds where the glint region is narrower or not as bright. The method presented here would generate a climatology of black carbon absorption with high accuracy corresponding to error in the single scattering albedo of ± 0.02. The method was developed for aerosol dominated by fine particles R eff < 0.5 μm , but can be applied to large particles with some modifications."
289,clouds,"Observation of dust and anthropogenic aerosol plumes in the Northwest Pacific with a two-wavelength polarization lidar on board the research vessel Mirai. [1] Dust and anthropogenic aerosol plumes from the Asian continent were observed in the Northwest Pacific 32.0degrees to 38.0degreesN, 146.5degreesE with a two-wavelength polarization lidar on board the research vessel Mirai during the MR01-K02 cruise May 14 to 28, 2001 . Dust aerosols were identified from the aerosol depolarization ratio at 532 nm and the ratio of the backscattering coefficient at 1064 nm and 532 nm. High aerosol density air masses with a low depolarization ratio and a small wavelength ratio indicating small particle size were also detected in the plume. The distribution patterns of the dust and the spherical aerosols were conceptionally explained by the model prediction for dust and sulfate with the Chemical Weather Forecast System CFORS . Aerosols with large particle size but with low depolarization ratio were also observed in between the layers of dust and sulfate. This indicates that the aerosols were possibly an internal mixture of dust and sulfate. . Thus, the outflow of desert dust and anthropogenic aerosol from Eastern Asia to the Pacific is the target of the Asian Pacific Regional Aerosol Characterization Experiment ACE-Asia of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Program IGAC . As a part of the Japanese activities in ACE-Asia, we conducted lidar observation in the Pacific on cruise MR01-K2 of the research vessel Mirai May 14 to 28, 2001 at the same time with various sampling measurements and physical measurements. In this paper, we report on the aerosol plumes observed with the lidar during the cruise.. We analyzed the characteristics of the observed aerosols using the aerosol depolarization ratio and the ratio of backscattering coefficients at 1064 nm and 532 nm. The aerosol depolarization ratio is useful for identifying dust aerosols because it indicates nonsphericity of the scatterer. The wavelength ratio is useful for obtaining aerosol particle size information. We also used the model prediction with the real-time Chemical Weather Forecast System CFORS developed at Kyushu University to identify aerosol types.. Automated sky-radiometer observation was conducted by Hokkaido University throughout the cruise. Radiosondes were launched twice a day 0900 and 2100 JST by the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center JAMSTEC . Also, surface meteorological parameters were recorded routinely.Cruise tracks of MR01-K02 of R/V Mirai... The threshold method was applied to detect clouds to the 15-min averaged lidar profiles. In the aerosol analysis, the profiles having clouds below 3 km were removed and the geometrical form factor correction was applied. Aerosol backscattering coefficient was obtained with the two-component backward inversion method with an assumption of constant lidar ratio or extinction-to-backscatter ratio , S1. We set the boundary condition above 6 km or at the highest height below the clouds when there were clouds between 3 and 6 km. We assumed S1 = 50 sr both at 532 nm and 1064 nm based on the climatological analysis for tropospheric aerosols over Tsukuba, Japan. The recent observations with a Raman lidar and a high-spectral-resolution lidar also showed that S1 is 40–55 at 532 nm for Asian dust. We tested S1 = 40 sr and 60 sr to estimate the error introduced by the assumption of S1. The difference from the S1 = 50 sr case was about +16% and −11% at 1 km height. We applied non-zero boundary values for aerosol backscattering when the inversion result gives negative backscatter coefficient in the lower altitude. The boundary values were determined iteratively. The Mie to Rayleigh scattering ratio at the boundary was less than 0.5 in the most cases. In the inversion of the 1064 nm data, we used the method similar to that developed for a space-borne lidar. In this method, the boundary conditions were determined from the signals at 532 nm, because the signal-to-noise ratio of the Rayleigh scattering signal at 1064 nm was not sufficiently high. The boundary values for Rayleigh and Mie scattering were separately estimated when non-zero boundary values were used in the inversion at 532 nm. We assumed a wavelength dependence of aerosol backscattering of λ −1 at the boundary.Results of the lidar observation during the cruise. a Cloud base height and apparent cloud top height, b aerosol backscattering coefficient at 532 nm, c aerosol depolarization ratio at 532 nm, d the ratio of the aerosol backscattering coefficients at 1064 nm to 532 nm, and e aerosol optical depth from the sea level to 6 km altitude with an assumption of S1 = 50. Optical depth obtained with a sky-radiometer is also indicated in e . Areas with insufficient signal-to-noise ratio were set to white. was derived from the total-to-Rayleigh backscattering ratio BR , and the total depolarization ratio TDR , from the following equation. where MDR is the molecular depolarization ratio. We used MDR = 0.014 in this work. ADR is sensitive to errors when the backscattering coefficient is small. We masked in Figure 2c the areas where the statistical error was large. Errors in wavelength ratio are introduced from the errors in backscattering coefficients at 532 nm and 1064 nm. The largest source of the error in 1064 nm in this work is the error in the boundary condition. Errors as large as 50% may be included in the absolute value. The relative error in a profile is smaller. The areas where the statistical error was large were masked in Figure 2 . Plumes of aerosols were observed from 1400 JST May 20 to 2300 JST May 21, and 2000 JST May 25 to 2200 JST May 26. The aerosol depolarization ratio ADR reveals that the plumes contain dust aerosols. The two-wavelength ratio indicates that particle size is relatively large in the plumes. This is consistent with the fact that dust aerosol particles are generally large. In the atmospheric boundary layer up to 0.6–1.5 km, ADR was generally low. However, it was slightly high on May 14–15 and May 18–22.  Figure 4 shows a scatter diagram of wavelength ratio and ADR in the plume observed during 0700–2100 JST on May 26. Three altitude regions are indicated in different colors. We used the data with sufficiently high backscattering coefficient >2 ∼ 10 −5 m −1 sr −1 . It can be seen that the aerosols in the three different altitude region have different characteristics. The open circles in Figure 4 indicate theoretical values calculated for A sulfate, B and C sea salt, and D and E dust using OPAC model. We gave the ADR of 0.3 for the dust arbitrarily here, because ADR is not obtained from OPAC. The line in the figure indicates theoretical values for simple external mixture of A and D. Though these modeled values are dependent on various assumptions and contain large ambiguity especially for dust aerosols, Figure 4 shows a possibility of characterizing aerosols using observed wavelength ratio and ADR. From Figure 4 and the distribution pattern of the CFORS prediction, the aerosols in the boundary layer are most likely a mixture of sea salt and sulfate. The aerosols in the upper layers are probably a mixture of sulfate and dust. A part of data points in the upper layers falls on a line describing an external mixture. However, there are many data points in the low ADR side of the line. This may be explained by internal mixing of dust and sulfate. Relative humidity observed with a radiosonde at 0900 May 26 was 60 to 65% at 0 to 1.2 km, 2.4 to 2.6 km, and 3.4 to 4.3 km, and 70 to 80% at1.6 to 1.8 km. In these high humidity regions, internal mixing possibly occurs.Scatter diagram of the aerosol depolarization ratio and the wavelength ratio for the aerosol plume observed on May 26. Open circles indicate calculated values using OPAC for a sulfate, b sea salt accumulation mode, c sea salt coarse mode, d dust desert without water soluble , and e dust mineral accumulation mode . ADR of dust was given arbitrarily in C and D. The line indicates theoretical curve for an external mixture of A and D.[13]  Plumes of dust and sulfate aerosols from the Asian continent were observed with the two-wavelength depolarization lidar in the Pacific. The distribution pattern of aerosols conceptionally agreed with the prediction by CFORS. Observed aerosol depolarization ratio and wavelength ratio indicates a possibility of characterization of aerosols using two-dimensional scatter diagram. The observed layered plume on May 26 shows the characteristics of a mixture of sea salt and sulfate in the boundary layer, and a mixture of sulfate and dust in the upper layers. Also, it shows a possibility of internal mixture of dust and sulfate. Though there is still large ambiguity in the interpretation, we think the characterization of aerosol using the scatter diagram is useful. We think it is important to accumulate lidar observation data to obtain climatological values for typical aerosol components and mixtures in the future studies."
290,ocean,"Distinguishing tropospheric aerosols from thin cirrus clouds for improved aerosol retrievals using the ratio of 1.38-mu m and 1.24-mu m channels. [1] The scattering of solar radiation by cirrus clouds often contaminates aerosol products retrieved from satellite-based measurements using channels located in the visible and near-IR spectral region. Previously, it was demonstrated that a narrow satellite channel located near 1.38 mum is very effective in detecting the high level thin cirrus clouds. In this paper, we describe a ratio technique using the 1.38-mum channel and the 1.24-mum channel for identifying pixels contaminated by thin cirrus clouds so that improved aerosol and dust products can be obtained. The multi-channel data acquired with the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer MODIS on the Terra Spacecraft are used to demonstrate this technique. , while the recent updates are described fully in the work of . This network employs automatic Sun photometers/sky radiometers, which are located at over 100 sites worldwide, and whose data are regularly made available online by the AERONET team http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/ . Among other optically equivalent aerosol parameters, AOT data are derived from most AERONET Sun photometers at 340, 380, 440, 500, 670, 870, and 1020 nm wavelengths, while a few of their newer instruments also provide AOT at 532, 535, and 1640 nm. AERONET provides highly accurate AOT data, with uncertainty levels in the range of 0.01 to 0.02 though slightly higher in the ultraviolet wavelengths . Typically, AOT is measured at each AERONET site at least every 15 min during the daytime under cloud-free conditions . It is, therefore, feasible and necessary to conduct periodic evaluation of the aerosol and other products, from both Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors, in a comparative and comprehensive manner., and . Results of some of the initial applications for global and regional studies have been published in the work of . Indeed, the aerosol community has long begun using MODIS data quantitatively and extensively for regional and global aerosol pollution assessments, climate forcing calculations, and model comparisons. Details of the latest algorithm status and main changes, as well as longer-term validation results from Terra-MODIS have been described in the work of . The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the quality of all available aerosol spectral optical thickness, τ aλ , generated from MODIS on both Terra and Aqua starting from the onset of data acquisition from each sensor up to the end of 2003. Obviously, this involves the analysis of a huge amount of different versions of data from two sensors covering the entire globe daily, one for almost 4 years, and the other for almost 2 years. Therefore it was necessary to design the study in such a way that the analysis will be well packaged and presented to adequately meet the needs of the scientific community, especially those involved in the quantitative use of the data. level 1.0 data , and level 2.0 quality assured level 1.5 data, having been checked and adjusted with predevelopment and postdeployment calibrations . AERONET level 1.5 data are available in near real time, while, depending on site and length of deployment, level 2.0 is only available several weeks to several months behind real time. Therefore, for reasons of expediency, MODIS aerosol validation is performed mostly with AERONET level 1.5 data.. “Mixed” is used to designate aerosol types with more than two dominant species such as combined influence of urban/industrial pollution, smoke, and dust . Most of the regional studies performed in this paper will refer to the regions represented in Figure 1 and Table 1 . To facilitate broad zoning in later sections, all regions having at least a negative -ve boundary longitude Min_Lon or Max_Lon in Table 1 will be classified as Western Hemisphere WH , while others will be classified as Eastern Hemisphere EH .Multiyear 2000–2003 average aerosol optical thickness AOT at 550 nm wavelength from Terra-MODIS showing rectangular boundaries of various regions referenced in this study. Land regions are delimited by solid lines with numeric labels 1–12 , while ocean regions are delimited by dotted lines with alphabetic labels A–F . Since MODIS currently does not retrieve aerosols over highly bright surfaces such as Greenland, the Sahara, and the Antarctica, the purple patches zero values in those regions may be due to artifacts from the plotting software.Local 50 × 50-km daily mean Terra- and Aqua-MODIS aerosol optical thickness AOT at three wavelengths 470, 550, and 660 nm over two sites one in the eastern United States GSFC and the other in the Arabian Sea in June/July 2002. Terra data are represented by thin solid lines and filled symbols, while Aqua data are represented by dotted lines and open symbols. AERONET mean AOT at 440 and 670 nm wavelengths averaged within ±30 min of Terra or Aqua overpass are superimposed on the GSFC panel thick solid curves , since this is also an AERONET site, to demonstrate that MODIS on Terra and Aqua observed the same pattern of time series as the AERONET ground-based measurements. shows a Terra-MODIS image of 7 July, with the dense smoke outflow from the Quebec fire reaching GSFC. Although AERONET does not provide level 1.5 or 2.0 AOT over GSFC on 7 July because their automatic cloud filter mistook the dense smoke for clouds, it was noted that “the τ a500 was estimated as ∼7 highest ever recorded in AERONET monitoring from the spectra in the longer wavelengths τ a870 ∼ 3 ”].  The bottom panel of Figure 10 , representing a remote site over the Arabian Sea, shows where, by coincidence, data points or peaks from Terra and Aqua-MODIS alternate with one another. This provides for continuity in data, which could have been missed if only one instrument was involved. In both cases, there is beautiful agreement on dates having retrieval from both instruments., which was rectified early in the algorithm for T004 and A003 . Regions with tendency toward overestimation are all over land and include: northwest America, central United States, eastern United States, western Europe, and India with an overall average overestimation of the order of 0.05 , and China, Middle East, and Australia with an overall average overestimation of the order of 0.15 .[43]  MODIS aerosol spectral optical thickness τ a λ from Terra and Aqua are appreciably accurate over ocean, but have a slightly lower quality over land. However, the data can be used for various kinds of global, regional, and local studies with acceptable accuracy. Analysis of MODIS τ a λ subdivided into three size ranges based on different AERONET Ångstrom exponent ranges α < 0.7, 0.7 < α < 1.8, and α > 1.8, respectively representing large, midrange, and small size modes , shows that the τ a λ values are more accurate over ocean than over land. Time series of the group monthly averages of data acquired over AERONET sites, both from Terra-MODIS and AERONET, show a net steady increase in the average loading of the large size mode α < 0.7 from 2000 to 2003, especially over ocean. MODIS regional monthly average τ a550 time series based on full spatial sampling show large variations in seasonal cycles between regions, but do not show a net increase of aerosol loading even over dust-dominated regions. There is great resemblance in the cyclic amplitude and phase between regions with common aerosol type, source, or distribution characteristics. Analysis of the regional daily mean τ a 550 differences between Terra and Aqua for the various study regions show that, although there are daily differences between the morning and afternoon observations from the twin sensors in most regions, the magnitudes of which vary from region to region, none of the regions shows any consistent morning-to-afternoon increase or decrease in aerosol loading. Combined plots of the Terra-MODIS and Aqua-MODIS τ a λ at the local scale for an over-land urban and an over-ocean dust environments, both of which contained some smoke, show that Terra and Aqua observations can provide for data continuity at different temporal scales.[44]  Finally, the evaluation done in this study has been extensive, employing an unprecedented number of collocated MODIS/AERONET data point pairs: over 23,000 for Terra and over 10,000 for Aqua. Although MODIS τ a λ accuracies do not reach AERONET accuracy levels of 0.02 , especially over land, given that MODIS is the first sensor used for operational aerosol retrieval at moderate scale both over land and ocean, and considering the numerous problems posed to aerosol retrieval by the surface background, especially over land, and the potential sampling mismatch in comparing averages from MODIS spatially variable data space and AERONET temporally variable data space, the overall performance of the Terra and Aqua twin MODIS sensors in aerosol retrieval is excellent. Nevertheless, the MODIS aerosol team continues to evaluate and understand the sources of uncertainty and continues to develop and implement strategies aimed at systematically eliminating as much uncertainties as possible in order to generate top quality products for all types of applications."
292,clouds ocean,"Enhanced aerosol loading over Arabian Sea during the pre-monsoon season: Natural or anthropogenic?. [1] Recent experiments conducted over the oceanic regions adjacent to the Indian sub continent have revealed the presence of anthropogenic aerosol haze during January to March. It has been suggested that the major source of this aerosol is South and Southeast Asia. Here we show from long term, multi-station and ship borne observations that aerosols transported from regions northwest of Indian subcontinent especially Arabian and Saharan regions mostly natural dust along with the locally produced sea-salt aerosols by sea-surface winds constitute a more significant source of aerosols during April-May period. The radiative forcing due to Arabian/Saharan aerosols mostly natural during April May period is comparable and often exceed as much as 1.5 times the forcing due to anthropogenic aerosols during January to March period. The presence of dust load over the Arabian Sea can influence the temperature profile and radiative balance in this region. . Although aerosols have an important role on climate they are poorly characterized in climate models because of the lack of a comprehensive database. Many experiments have been conducted to improve our understanding the role of aerosols. Some of these are Aerosol Characterization Experiment ACE-1 and ACE-2 , Smoke, Clouds, Aerosols, Radiation-Brazil SCAR-B , Tropospheric Aerosol Radiative Forcing Observational Experiment TARFOX and the recently concluded Indian Ocean Experiment INDOEX . During Indian Middle Atmosphere Programme IMAP , a project was initiated to monitor the aerosol characteristics over the Indian region at selected sites. The programme, which became operational in late eighties, was expanded during Indian Space Research Organisation's Geosphere Biosphere Programme ISRO-GBP . Characterisation of marine aerosols using long-term data has been one of the major objectives of this programme. With this objective an observational site was established at Minicoy 8.5°N, 73°E in Lakshadweep group of islands in January 1995. Extensive measurements were carried out at Minicoy from January 1995 to March 1998.. These experiments however, concentrated primarily on January to March period during which the airmass is mainly from Indian subcontinent. In this paper, we examine the seasonal variation of the aerosol characteristics to assess the role of different air masses on aerosol characteristics over oceanic regions adjacent to Indian sub continent. We show that air masses from adjacent regions other than Indian subcontinent are also important in influencing the aerosol loading in this region.. In addition, a hand held Microtops sun photometer Solar Light, USA was also used. The instrument used at Minicoy was a Multi-wavelength solar Radiometer MWR , the details of which are available elsewhere. Long-term measurements made at Minicoy from 1995 to 1998 and those made at KCO from 1998 to 2000 were examined. The temporal variation of aerosol optical depth during 1998 is shown in Figure 1a for two representative wavelengths, one visible 500 nm and one near IR 1020 nm data from KCO observations . We found that April–May optical depths are larger than those during January–March period. The spectral variation of aerosol optical depth averaged over January to March and April & May is shown in Figure 1b for 1995 to 1998 data from Minicoy observations . While there is no significant difference in visible wavelengths, there is a significant increase in near IR wavelengths during April–May compared to January–March mean. The average aerosol optical depths 500 nm for January to March and April to May are shown in Figure 2 for 1995 to 2000. It can be seen that April-May mean values are comparable with January–March mean values and even exceed the January–March values occasionally e.g., 1997 . Since aerosols of anthropogenic origin mostly sub micron influence visible wavelengths and natural aerosols mostly super micron influence near IR wavelengths natural aerosols can influence sub micron range also , Figure 1b provides a clear indication of the presence of larger aerosols such as sea-salt or dust. During April–May period, the wind speeds are low, and hence significant amount of sea-salt is not expected. a Aerosol optical depth at two wavelengths at KCO b Aerosol spectral optical depth for January–March average and April–May average at Minicoy for the period 1995 to 1998.Aerosol visible optical depth averaged for January–March and April–May for the period 1995 to 2000. Minicoy data was used from 1995 to 1998 and KCO data was used for 1998 to 2000. also supports the above conclusion. As the winds which influence the Arabian Sea during May can have northerly and southerly components we examine the effect of meridional component of wind on aerosol optical depths Figure 3b data during May 1999 . It can be seen that whenever winds have a strong northerly component from Arabian and Saharan regions aerosol optical depths are high. This demonstrates that over regions northwest of continental India the aerosol load is quite high. Back- trajectory analysis using HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory HYSPLIT4 Model, 1997; Web address: http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ready/hysplit4.html , NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, Silver Spring, MD were made on a daily basis over northern 20°N, 65°E , central 15°N, 65°E and southern Arabian Sea 10°N, 65°E for May, 1998. Our analysis have shown that for about 85% of the days during May 1998 the air mass in northern Arabian Sea had their origin in the Arabian or Saharan deserts. Similarly, for central and southern Arabian Sea for about 70% and 65% of the days during May 1998 respectively, the air mass arrived from Arabian or the Saharan deserts. How about other parts of Arabian Sea? a Wind pattern for May, 1998 b Dependence of aerosol optical depth on wind direction. experiments over the northern Arabian Sea ∼15°N during 1996 showed that the aerosol optical depths during January–February period was ∼0.2 average whereas in April it was ∼0.4 monthly average . During January–March period, winds are from Indian subcontinent and during April–May winds are from northwest. Next we examine 15 years of aerosol optical depth data collected at Trivandrum 8.5°N, 77°E a site situated on the western coast of India. Note that the optical depth during April–May ∼0.40 is larger compared to January–March period ∼0.32 .  In a recent study, . The iron content in mineral dust can fertilize the phytoplankton and hence catalyse the dimethyl sulphide DMS emission which in turn influence the cloud cover. Both sea-salt and dust can have influence on sea-surface temperature due to the surface cooling effect. Also as sea-salt aerosols are hygroscopic, winds have an effect on the number of cloud condensation nuclei CCN in the atmosphere.  In summary, there exists significant transport of aerosols from Sahara across the Arabian Sea when northwesterly winds prevail. A major fraction of this aerosol is of natural origin. For six months May to September and December , more than 50% of the aerosol optical depth is contributed by natural aerosols. This transport during May has a greater impact than those transported from Asia by northeasterly winds during January–March period. Clearly these aerosols transported by northwesterly winds can have significant effects on regional climate system, which need to be understood."
293,clouds ocean,"Detection of aerosol types over the East China Sea near Japan from four-channel satellite data. [1] Aerosol-type detection from satellite remote sensing is difficult but an important challenge for improving the estimation of aerosol radiative forcing. In this paper, we have classified aerosols into four major aerosol types, that is, soil dust, carbonaceous, sulfate and sea salt aerosols using SeaWiFS four-channel data. The retrieved results show that the East China Sea region was loaded with different aerosols in a highly mixed condition. We also succeeded in classifying the volcanic plume from Mt. Oyama located on Miyakejima Island as sulfate aerosols. . Aerosol type is one of the important parameters for the forcing evaluation, since the aerosol climate effects considerably differ from one type to another. The most important aerosol types are soil dust, carbonaceous, sulfate, and sea salt aerosols. Their representative particle size and radiation absorptivity are quite different. Soil dust aerosol particles, for example, are large in size and significantly absorb shortwave radiation, while sulfate aerosol particles are small in size and are non-absorbing. Carbonaceous aerosols are more complicated in their chemical and optical properties, but they are commonly recognized as a strongly absorbing aerosol with the inclusion of soot particles.. POLDER made it possible to retrieve aerosol distributions over land using polarized radiance. The UV algorithm of  In this paper, we propose a new algorithm of an aerosol type classification combining the two-channel method and the UV method. In the second step of our algorithm, we test the blue radiation absorptivity of aerosol particles in the SeaWiFS channels 1 and 2, of which the center wavelengths are 412 and 443 nm, respectively. The difference in the apparent aerosol reflectance between channels 1 and 2 for the absorbing model is smaller than that for the non-absorbing model as confirmed by several numerical simulations, as understood by the following approximated relation for the difference in reflectances at the two wavelengths: where ω, τ a , In the open sea area, the algorithm successfully classified the aerosols as ‘Sea salt’ with the aerosol optical thickness less than 0.1, and with a small Ångström exponent. It should be noted that the sulfate aerosol type was detected only in a small area of Figure 2e , while the carbonaceous aerosol type covered most of the region affected by the outflow from the continent. A numerical test has shown that our algorithm tends to choose the carbonaceous aerosol when the contribution of carbonaceous aerosols in the total aerosol optical thickness is greater than about 30%, although the critical value depends on the detailed condition of the retrieval. Therefore, our result means that the carbonaceous aerosol contribution is dominant in this region. This observation is consistent with the recent model simulations suggesting that the optical thickness of the carbonaceous aerosols is as large as that of the sulfate aerosols in this region. used TOMS data to detect SO 2 clouds emitted from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991. The sensitivity of this method is not very high such that a narrow plume near the volcano cannot be detected. There are reports using the thermal split window channels of AVHRR. This method has the advantage of high spatial resolution detection of narrow plumes with widths of several kilometers both under day and night conditions. The sign of the brightness temperature difference is opposite from that of high-level cirrus clouds, because of the different wavelength dependence of the single scattering albedo of volcano ash particles from that of ice particles. This algorithm is, however, affected by the vertical temperature profile, thus making it difficult to be applied to a quantitative estimate of the volume of the volcanic ash. On the other hand, our method uses the difference in the optical properties of aerosols in the blue to red spectral region, and can provide high spatial resolution information independent from the thermal method. Especially, it is not difficult to estimate the mass of the volcanic aerosols, M , by the relation: where ρ, τ a , Q e , W , and V are the aerosol density, optical thickness, extinction efficiency factor for particle size r e , width of the smoke plume, and wind velocity, respectively. We analyzed 12 volcanic plumes identified in April and May, obtaining the plume parameters from satellite images and the retrieved results from the four-channel method. Assuming an extinction efficiency factor of 3.01 for a typical effective radius of 0.5 μm and the density of volcanic aerosol of 2.5 g/cm 3 , the aerosol mass was roughly estimated as 4365 tons/day. This value means a conversion rate of about 23% of the total SO 2 emission if we believe the value of 2 × 10 4 tons/day reported by JMA. This conversion rate is considered to be reasonable, because recent aerosol transport models show that the conversion rate from SO 2 to sulfate is about 76% and about 36% of the converted sulfate is produced through the gas-phase reaction under the clear sky condition, which is our satellite measurement condition.A near-true color image of SeaWiFS a and retrieved aerosol type b on May 4, 2001 from 32°N to 36°N and from 138°E to 142°E. Color codes are the same as that in Figure 2e .[12]  We have developed a four-channel algorithm to classify aerosols into four types of soil dust, carbonaceous, sulfate, and sea salt aerosols. This algorithm has been applied to the SeaWiFS data during the APEX-E2/ACE-Asia in the period of March to May 2001. The retrieved results were found to be in better agreement with the ground-based measurement values than with the conventional two-channel method. It was found that the East China Sea region had complicated mixtures of different types of aerosols. We also detected the sulfate aerosol plumes from the Mt. Oyama volcano located on Miyakejima Island. The mass conversion rate of the sulfate aerosols was estimated to be 23% of the emitted SO 2 amount."

[1] The uptake of ozone on various mineral powders has been studied using a Knudsen cell apparatus at T = 296 K. Samples included alpha-Al2O3, alpha-Fe2O3, SiO2, China loess and Saharan sand. Reactive uptake coefficients, gamma BET , were measured for the various particles and found to be 8 +/- 5 x 10 -5 for alpha-Al2O3, 1.8 +/- 0.7 x 10 -4 for alpha-Fe2O3 and 5 +/- 3 x 10 -5 for SiO2. The authentic dust samples were found to have gamma BET values of 2.7 +/- 0.9 x 10 -5 for China loess and 6 +/- 3 x 10 -5 for Saharan sand. Variations in the reactivity of the Saharan sand were observed as a function of sample treatment. Under the conditions of this study, heterogeneous uptake of ozone is catalytic and results in the destruction of ozone. , with that value likely to increase due to the predicted expansion of arid regions. Once in the atmosphere, these mineral dust particles can be transported, often long distances from their point of origin, thereby exposed to many reactive species, which possibly can affect more than the local tropospheric chemistry and climate. One species reactive with mineral aerosols that is of great interest is ozone as ozone is a significant tropospheric pollutant.. In particular, observed this anti-correlation in an air mass over the North Atlantic Ocean that contained mineral aerosols originating from the Saharan desert. However, there are very few laboratory investigations on the reaction of ozone on mineral dust particles and atmospherically relevant metal and nonmetal oxides. Currently, most of the literature addresses the reaction of ozone on metal oxide surfaces that are not major components in mineral dust and describe experiments conducted in order to develop ozone decomposition catalysts. These decomposition catalysis studies are summarized in review articles by  The different preparation methods of the Saharan sand samples were found to affect the reactivity of the particles. Ground sand had a γ BET value, 6 ± 3 × 10 −5 , that was an order of magnitude higher than the 4 ± 2 × 10 −6 measured for the sieved sand. It is possible that the process of grinding the sand particles created active sites that did not exist on the original sand particles. Additionally, fractionating the particles by sieving may change the elemental composition of the sand by excluding certain minerals and concentrating others. Previous studies have shown that elemental and mineralogical composition of Saharan sand depends on source location and particle size. Therefore, the γ BET value of 6 ± 3 × 10 −5 for ground Saharan sand that is reported here should be considered as an upper limit for the reactive uptake of ozone by Saharan sand.. While the mechanism is still unclear, it is proposed that adsorption of ozone on active surface sites is relatively fast and desorption of molecular oxygen from the surface is slow, with a net loss of two ozone molecules and net production of three oxygen molecules., aqueous droplets and freshly produced soot. However, the catalytic nature of the mineral oxide particles may make this reaction important in the atmosphere. Additionally, it should be noted that the uptake coefficients reported in this study may be altered from the true uptake in the atmosphere due to weathering of the particles by exposure to water and organic and inorganic species."
295,particles dust aerosol,"Non-spherical aerosol retrieval method employing light scattering by spheroids. [1] Numerous studies indicate the need to account for particle non-sphericity in modeling the optical properties of dustlike aerosols. The methods for simulating the scattering of light by various non-spherical shapes have rapidly evolved over the last two decades. However, the majority of aerosol remote-sensing retrievals still rely on the Mie theory because retrievals accounting for particle non-sphericity are not as well defined methodologically and are demanding computationally. We propose a method for the retrieval of the optical properties of non-spherical aerosol based on the model of a shape mixture of randomly oriented polydisperse spheroids. This method is applied to angular and spectral radiation measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network AERONET in locations influenced by desert dust. Comparisons with Mie-based retrievals show a significant improvement in dust-particle phase functions, size distributions, and refractive indices. . The uncertainty in the knowledge of aerosols is explained by difficulties in monitoring spatially- and temporally-variable aerosol properties. Recent progress in both satellite and ground-based remote sensing enables the scientific community to obtain global aerosol data. However, the accuracy of remote-sensing aerosol characterization is limited by a number of unresolved issues, including the difficulty to model the optical properties of non-spherical dustlike aerosols. that the non-sphericity of desert dust particles can cause scattering properties significantly different from those predicted by the standard Mie theory. Although non-spherical scattering has been discussed in the literature for several decades, only recent research, aided by progress in computer technology, resulted in practically useful theoretical models. This progress has stimulated efforts in improving the accuracy of aerosol retrievals in the presence of non-spherical particles. However, dealing with non-sphericity is not a completely resolved issue, and most aerosol retrieval algorithms are still based on the Mie theory. Indeed, incorporating non-spherical scattering in remote sensing retrievals is problematic methodologically and technically. Microphoto-graphs of natural aerosols show a great variety of shapes, thus making difficult a realistic choice of a particle shape or shape mixture model. Furthermore, all available theoretical methods have certain limitations in their applicability. For example, even the use of the simplest non-spherical particles, spheroids, requires a combination of two methods in order to cover the entire range of aerosol sizes see below . Also, some remote-sensing observations of dustlike aerosols seem to indicate a significantly lower importance of non-spherical scattering than predicted by laboratory measurements and theoretical models. It is thus clear that the issue of non-sphericity of dustlike particles in aerosol remote sensing needs further analyses. desert dust observations. This parameterization does not rely on Mie scattering but rather is based on the model of polydisperse, randomly oriented spheroids.. As demonstrated by sensitivity studies, this procedure allows the retrieval of both particle size distribution and complex refractive index, as well as such a climatically important aerosol characteristic as single scattering albedo. It also appears that these retrievals are rather sensitive to particle non-sphericity. Specifically, numerical tests have shown that non-sphericity may cause two kinds of retrieval artifacts: i a high concentration of very small particles with radii less than 0.1 μm, and ii an unrealistically strong decrease of the real part of the refractive index with decreasing wavelength, λ. Both artifacts have been clearly observed in analyses of AERONET data from several locations bordering the Sahara desert. The agreement between the sensitivity analyses and the actual retrievals motivated us to attempt the development of a retrieval code based on a non-spherical aerosol model.. We decided to implement the same approach in the inversion code of with the largest median radius of the coarse mode r v coarse ∼ 2.54 μm, as observed by AERONET in the Persian Gulf. Some observations indicate size distributions with median radii for dV / d ln r up to 5 μm and even larger. Therefore it appears critical to assume the potential presence of particles larger than x ∼100–120 as suggested by Figure 2 , and so we relied on the size range of equation 6 covering r up to 15 μm. This required only two points with x i > 100 for λ = 0.44 μm with the chosen logarithmically equidistant bins  Hence, in spite of the long computing time, we have calculated K ext …; n , k , ε p and K scat …; n , k , ε p for randomly oriented prolate and oblate spheroids with ε p from 1.2 to 2.4 with step 0.2 and for the n , k , and r values given by equation 6 ., which uses Mie scattering with presumed n and k we used the values obtained from the spheroid retrieval . Figure 4 shows that P Θ retrieved using spheroids exhibits significant differences with both retrievals that used Mie scattering.The comparison of desert dust properties retrieved using spheroid and Mie scattering models Persian Gulf, May 1999 .Comparison of desert dust phase functions retrieved using the spheroid and Mie-based scattering models. but with a slightly narrower range of ε p . Specifically, we used an equiprobable distribution of prolate and oblate spheroids with aspect ratios ε p ranging from 1.6 to 2.2. This shape distribution was chosen in a series of test retrievals. We inverted many real AERONET observations of desert dust assuming spheroids of single shape. We found that the retrieval artifacts attributed to ignoring particle non-sphericity were significantly reduced if we used single-shape spheroids with ε p in the range from 1.8 to 2.0, whereas for ε p both smaller than 1.6 and larger than 2.2 the artifacts were strongly pronounced. Also we found that using equally mixed prolate and oblate spheroids with ε p from 1.6 to 2.2 resulted in superior retrievals compared to those obtained using spheroids of any single shape or other tested mixtures of shapes. However, the significant improvement in the 90% of dust retrievals clearly indicates the importance of taking into account the effects of nonsphericity in the retrieval algorithm. Indeed, using the spheroid model we were able to derive more accurately particle size, complex refractive index, and phase function from atmospheric radiances measured in a wide scattering-angle range from 3° to ∼150° . The improvement in the derived phase functions is probably the most important, because a correct P Θ cannot be simulated even from the correct size distribution e.g. obtained from measurements at Θ < 40° and known refractive index without addressing the issue of particle shape.[16]  We have employed the model of dustlike aerosol particles as polydisperse, randomly oriented spheroids for retrieving aerosol optical properties from remote measurements of atmospheric radiances. The application to AERONET measurements taken at several dust-dominated locations has shown significant improvements in the retrieved size distribution, refractive index, and phase function. Nevertheless, this study is only our first attempt to explore the implications of non-spherical particle scattering for desert dust characterization, and several aspects of the retrieval approach are planned to be improved. For example, we plan to address the possibility of optimizing particle aspect- ratio distributions for each retrieval and to improve the accuracy of computing the spheroid kernel matrices. The validation of the retrievals by independent field measurements will also be an important factor in further justification and improvement of the presented non-spherical aerosol retrieval method."
296,particles aerosol,"Importance of shapes and compositions of wind-blown dust particles for remote sensing at solar wavelengths. [1] The quality of satellite aerosol retrievals depends critically upon the modeling accuracy of the aerosol optical properties. The optical properties of mineral aerosols depend on particle morphology, mineralogy, and state of mixing. Here we investigate how the realistic morphology and composition of dust particles affect the optical properties of dust mixtures by utilizing microscopy data that recently become available of dust samples collected in the atmosphere. The data were used to reconstruct the representative composition-shape-size CSS distributions and then the discrete dipole approximation technique was applied to calculate the optical properties. We demonstrate that the presence of sharp-edge, angular-type particles results in various differences in the scattering phase function, asymmetry parameter, optical depth and single scattering albedo compared to those of the volume-equivalent spheres or ellipses. These differences are sufficiently large as to affect the retrievals of aerosol optical properties from satellite and ground-based remote sensing observations at the solar wavelengths. . To fully benefit from the wealth of data provided by new sensors, the improvement of dust optical models used in retrieval algorithms is needed.. The only dust retrieval that account for particle nonsphericity is the MISR algorithm that uses ellipsoid models derived from T-matrix calculations. Ellipsoidal models offer a considerable improvement over use of Mie theory, though there is a need to test the applicability of these models. Various data demonstrate that mineral dust particles are not only nonspherical but also in majority are angular and sharp-edge.. These studies mainly focused on the comparison of optical properties of particles having a distinct model shape and those of volume- or surface-equivalent spheres, without being concerned about how well these model shapes represent actual atmospheric dust particles. Only one or two values of the refractive indices were used in previous calculations, overlooking that various mineral species show distinct refractive indices as a function of the wavelength. In order to account for realistic dust particle shapes and compositions, we perform the modeling of dust optical properties utilizing the new microscopy data. The goal is to estimate the extent to which the realistic particle morphology and composition affect the dust optical properties and hence the retrievals of aerosols from satellite and ground-based observations.. An ensemble of dust particles can be thought of as an external mixture of particle classes where each class is defined by a particular combination of shape and composition. Because the size-averaged optical properties of the external mixture can be calculated as a weighted sum of optical properties of individual components, one can compute size-averaged optical characteristics of individual classes and then use these results to calculate optical properties of the dust mixtures of various CSS distributions. Following this strategy, we computed the optical properties of a number of dust classes formed with selected regular and reconstructed irregular shapes identified in the SEM images. To calculate the orientationally-averaged optical properties of nonspherical shapes, we used the discrete-dipole approximation DDA technique. The particle volume-equivalent diameter was chosen to be in the range 0.1–2 μm based on reported microscopy data, though the geometrical diameter of a nonspherical particle can be much larger, depending on the particle thickness. We assumed that dust classes have the same log-normal size distribution with the medium radius. This range defines two cases of weak and strong absorption considered in our study: 90% clay + 10% hematite Saharan dust analog , and 99% clay + 1% hematite Asian dust analog .  Figure 2 demonstrates the differences in phase functions of realistic dust mixtures and those of the equal-volume spheres for Saharan and Asian dust analogs at λ = 0.55 μm. This wavelength is often used in remote sensing e.g., MISR . The phase functions of CSS 1,2, and 3 distributions, calculated under the assumption that the particle thickness is equal to its width, are somewhat similar for both types of absorption. The phase function of the CSS4 distribution, calculated using the statistical thickness and circularity distribution reported by , our study shows that the magnitude of nonspherical-spherical differences strongly depends on the degree of particle irregularity, as well as on dust particle composition.Scattering phase functions of CSS distributions at λ = 0.55 μm for a Saharan dust analog, and b Asian dust analog. The nonspherical-spherical differences in ω 0 increase with increasing absorption. In the case of Saharan dust, these differences could change the dust radiative effect from the heating if equal-volume spheres are used to the cooling if ω 0 are calculated for CSS distributions , depending on the surface albedo and sun angle. In turn, larger values of the extinction coefficient result in the larger optical depth of a dust layer of realistic dust mixtures compared to the dust mixture of spherical particles for the same dust loading. To illustrate, Figure 3 shows the nonspherical-spherical differences in the optical depth 1km dust layer at 0.55 μm calculated for the Saharan dust analog. For the particle number concentration of 1000 cm −3 representative of dust-storm conditions , CSS3 and CSS4 differ ∼30% from the equal-volume spheres Δτ = 0.56, τ sph = 1.89 . In addition, the differences in the extinction coefficient can hamper the interpretation of visibility degradation. Visibility observations are often used to evaluate the aerosol concentration and vertical distribution.The differences in optical depth between CSS distributions and volume-equivalent spheres at λ = 0.55 μm for the Saharan dust analog. It has been suggested that collocated satellite and ground-based observations can be used to retrieve the single scattering albedo from satellite observations by utilizing the aerosol optical depth provided by sunphotometers or lidars . If the “true” optical depth is known from sunphotometer measurements i.e., from measurements of direct solar radiation , then the errors in ω 0 retrievals would depend on the ratio of the scattering phase functions P Θ CSS / P Θ sph . Because the above ratio is similar to one shown in Figure 4a , one can expect that ω 0 would be underestimated from satellite observations at the backscattering angles Θ > 150° but ω 0 can be under or overestimated between 130°–150°. If one uses the optical depth retrieved from the lidars, the satellite retrievals overestimate ω 0 for Θ < 150°. Figure 4b demonstrates this effect. Here we assumed that the optical depth retrieved from the sunphotometer is about twice of that retrieved from the lidar. In summary, we conclude that it is critical to account for dust nonsphericity effects in satellite retrieval algorithms, as well as in the validation procedures utilizing the ground-based observations.[15]  Our calculations demonstrate that the scattering phase function of nonspherical particle shapes identified in the SEM/TEM images show distinct differences from those of spheres and ellipses. Thin particles with angular, sharp-edge shapes are often a dominant type. These types of particles result in the scattering phase functions that have lower values at the backscattering angles but higher values at forward scattering angles relative to spheres and ellipses. In addition, these types of particles result in larger values of the single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, and extinction coefficient and hence in aerosol optical depth . The nonspherical-spherical differences in the single scattering albedo increase with increasing absorption. The scattered intensities of the irregular shapes studied here could be as much as 1.5 times larger at forward scattering angles and as ∼2 times smaller at backscattering angles than those of volume-equivalent spheres. This translates into an underestimation of the optical depth retrieved from satellite and lidar observations and an overestimation of the optical depth retrieved from forward scattered intensities measured from the ground, if the spherical particle assumption were used in the retrievals."
297,particles,"Indirect climate forcing over the western US from Asian dust storms. [1] Aerosols lofted to high altitudes by springtime Asian dust storms advect across the Pacific Ocean and, as recognized in recent years, regularly reach the western US. As part of our long-term cirrus cloud research program using remote sensing measurements, we have observed unusually warm cirrus ice clouds associated with transported Asian dust aerosols. The polarization lidar data presented for illustration here suggest that the dust particles, which are indicated to be especially active ice nuclei, can affect the formation and phase of clouds, and hence alter their radiative properties at least as far away as the eastern Great Basin of the US. . Evidence has accumulated that the long-range transport of Asian dust across the Pacific Ocean has left its mark on the soils of Hawaii and the ice sheet of Greenland , 1969 ]. It has also recently been realized that the transport of the dust storm debris can even impact North American air quality. Over the past few years since the major April 1998 Asian dust storm events, a variety of international research programs using advanced instruments have been applied to monitoring the consequences of the dust storms. The tools involve a growing array of aerosol lidar sites combined with advanced satellite-based measurements and aerosol transport models that track the path of the dust clouds over extended distances. From this increased scientific scrutiny it is clear that the direct climatic effects of Asian dust storms extend over a wide geographic region of the Northern Hemisphere. It is also of considerable interest whether current agricultural activities in the worlds desert regions, or other climatic factors, are adding to the historic impact of the intensity of dust storms.. The measurements are part of a long-term cirrus research program described below, which have serendipitously also captured considerable information concerning the debris from Asian dust storms. have been collected from the University of Utah Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing. These measurements, which amount to ∼200-h per year, have been directed primarily toward sampling cirrus clouds during periods corresponding to satellite overpasses for the purpose of validating the cloud properties retrieved from Earth orbit. Nonetheless, the lidar data typically have sufficient dynamic range to reveal the presence of even weakly backscattered signals from aerosols from just above the surface to altitudes up to the middle and upper troposphere., the lidar-derived aerosol heights often correspond to the locations of dry air layers, in keeping with the concept of aeolian lifting and transport in a generally cloud- and precipitation-free environment. In many cases, the local arrival of Asian dust clouds is predicted by satellite observations and aerosol transport models, following Asian surface and lidar reports of dust storm activity. This international effort has been greatly facilitated by a “virtual” scientific community of internet-based real-time information exchanges., which makes them capable of generating significant amounts of laser backscatter depolarization. The lidar linear depolarization ratio δ, the ratio the backscattered powers in the planes of polarization orthogonal and parallel to that the transmitted laser pulse, is used to characterize the change in the state of backscattered laser light. Thus, lidar systems with polarization diversity have an advantage in identifying these depolarizing particles, in comparison to the small amounts of depolarization produced by spherical haze particles or minute particulates. However, nonspherical particle size also exerts an influence on lidar δ-values, because the effective diameter must be at least comparable to the incident wavelength to generate significant depolarization. In terms of cloud research, the ability to distinguish between spherical droplets and ice crystals using backscatter depolarization is unambiguous..Time height displays for the afternoon of 29 April 2001 from the ruby 0.694 μm wavelength polarization lidar at FARS in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the weeks following massive Asian dust storms. Shown at top is a gray-scale display of relative laser backscattering in relative logarithmic units, along with temperature profile at right for 0000 UTC. The bottom display gives lidar linear depolarization values see color scale to right of the aerosol and cirrus cloud layers present.As in Figure 1 , except for the early hours of 30 April 2001.As in Figure 1 , except for the afternoon hours of 30 April 2001.. As a matter of fact, <2% of all cirrus studied at FARS have temperatures >−40°C, and most of these correspond to sheared particle fallstreaks extending below colder cirrus, certainly not the case here. Nor are these unusual cloud conditions unique at FARS. A particularly interesting example occurred on 19 April 2001, when fractus-like clouds composed of ice were sampled at the top of a dust-filled convective boundary layer at −21°C. The concurrent sounding indicated humidities very close to water-saturation at this level. Normally, liquid phase fractocumulus clouds would be expected to form under such conditions, but in this case the dust particles may have served as deposition nuclei and formed ice directly from the vapor in ice-supersaturated air. Such evidence indicates that the phase of clouds can be influenced by the presence of Asian dust. the properties of the low cirrus cloud layers associated with the Asian aerosol are highly unusual. With cloud top temperatures as warm as −20°C, few, if any, cirrus clouds in the FARS sample had such warm temperatures. Moreover, observations of supercooled liquid altocumulus clouds with temperatures between −20° to −35°C are not uncommon at our locale. Below we describe the results of laboratory research that indicate that it is the unusual ice nucleating capabilities of Asian dust particles that may be responsible for these findings.. At a chamber temperature of −20°C, in excess of 50 IN per liter were obtained when the air mass trajectories were traced back to Asian dust storms. Such concentrations were the highest observed and significantly greater than those measured when under maritime air flow, and are now known to be comparable to typical ice crystal concentrations in many cirrus clouds. The great efficacy of some dust particles to serve as IN has been attributed to the similar crystallographic structure of clay materials such as kaolinite to that of ice. Schaller and Fukuta  The knowledge gained from early laboratory studies that wind-raised desert dust particles from Asia are especially effective IN has been overlooked until quite recently. Climate change issues have emphasized the direct forcings caused by increased Greenhouse gases and pollution aerosols in the atmosphere, although the more difficult problem of the indirect climatic effects of aerosols acting as cloud-forming particles is gaining increasing attention. The latter can include the effects of industrial pollutants, and ship and aircraft engine exhausts on cloud content, and as now coming under scrutiny, the consequences of increased biomass burning and desertification.. Through case studies and climatologically-based comparisons, it is now also indicated that supercooled water clouds can be converted to ice clouds at moderate temperatures, say perhaps 20°C warmer than what is typical from the homogeneous nucleation of cloud droplets in the middle and upper troposphere. This results in the creation of cirrus or cirrus-like clouds at much warmer than usual temperatures, and probably in the shorter life span of supercooled water/mixed phase clouds. In one of the examples given here, a midlevel water cloud was noted from visual observations to gradually transform into an ice cloud. The phase change in this case altered the characteristic cloud particle sizes and perhaps the cloud lifetime, which is certain to modulate the radiative processes in the atmosphere. The overall climatic impact of such processes is not straightforward to evaluate, but mean water cloud reductions could decrease the planetary albedo and increase surface warming. The effects of possibly increased lower-level cirrus clouds also need to be evaluated. Radiative calculations tailored to this particular scenario are clearly needed to resolve this issue, along with an innovatory of the various global sources and amounts of desert dusts. However, if atmospheric dust transport is increasing due to our changes in land use in Asia and elsewhere, then this will represent yet another mechanism by which humans are perturbing our climate."
298,aerosol clouds,"Heterogeneous nucleation of ice in (NH4)(2)SO4-H2O particles with mineral dust immersions. [1] Using optical microscopy, we investigated the heterogeneous nucleation of ice in aqueous NH4 2 SO4-H2O particles containing two types of mineral dusts, kaolinite and montmorillonite. The efficacy of montmorillonite and kaolinite to nucleate ice in NH4 2 SO4-H2O particles is similar. The difference in freezing temperatures, compared to the homogeneous freezing temperatures, is found to vary from 8-20 K and it is larger for particles with concentrations greater than 27 wt %. Our freezing data shows that for temperatures ranging from 239 K to 198 K, ice super-saturations between 1.35 and 1.51 are required for ice to heterogeneously nucleate in NH4SO4-H2O particles containing mineral dust immersions. Based on our results, we conclude mineral dust is an efficient nuclei for ice in NH4SO4-H2O aerosols and as a result, it can initiate the formation of upper tropospheric ice clouds at warmer temperatures and lower super-saturations in comparison to homogeneous freezing. . or heterogeneously when nucleation occurs on the surface of insoluble particles or crystallized salt cores. Several researchers have investigated homogeneous freezing in aqueous particles relevant to the UT. However, there have been only three experimental studies of the heterogeneous nucleation of ice in concentrated aqueous aerosols. In these studies the efficiency of soot, solid NH 4 2 SO 4 , and solid NH 4 HSO 4 , as heterogeneous nuclei was investigated.. This dust is largely produced in the Gobi and Saharan desert dust storms which then advects over long distances across the oceans, becoming coated with sulfates and other electrolytes after passing over polluted continental regions. Several researchers have investigated ice formation in pure water and dilute aqueous particles containing mineral dusts but these results generally do not apply to the UT since UT aerosols are typically concentrated aqueous electrolyte solutions. Experimental data on ice formation in concentrated aqueous particles containing mineral dusts is crucial for improving models of UT clouds.. NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O particles were chosen because they are representative of the aqueous particles found in the UT.. Briefly, an optical microscope was equipped with a cold stage that housed a quartz microcell that was pretreated with an organosilane AquaSil, Hampton Research Inc. to produce a monomolecular hydrophobic surface layer. We have shown previously that this hydrophobic surface does not promote nucleation of ice. Powdered dust was first sprinkled onto the pre-treated surface of the quartz cell. Aqueous particles of NH 4 2 SO 4 were then deposited onto the same surface using a nebulizer. Using this process, we were able to create 10–55 μm-sized aqueous particles that had numerous dust particles immersed in each aqueous particle, as determined by the microscope referred to as liquid-dust particles from here on . After exposing these liquid-dust particles to a constant relative humidity in order to fix their aqueous composition, Halocarbon grease Halocarbon Products, Series 28LT was added to the cell and the cell was sealed. Addition of excess halocarbon grease resulted in isolating individual particles from each other in the grease matrix. This prevented mass transfer of water vapor between individual particles during the freezing process, thus keeping the concentration of individual particles constant throughout the experiment.  Figure 2 shows the phase diagram for the NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O system as well as our results for ice nucleation by kaolinite and montmorillonite. The thin solid line indicates the results reported by . We also conducted experiments not shown here without the presence of dust, and our results are in agreement with the homogeneous freezing data reported by for homogeneous freezing of ice in NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O particles. The blue open squares represent our data for heterogeneous freezing of ice in individual NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O-kaolinite particles and the blue filled squares represent the median freezing temperatures calculated from the results of each set of experiments. The red open circles represent our data for heterogeneous freezing of ice in individual NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O-montmorillonite particles and the red filled circles represent the median freezing temperatures calculated from each set of experiments. The dashed line represents the equation T f = 242.21 − 1.7ΔT m see text for detail . have suggested that the negatively charged sulfate ions may interact with the mineral surface and we think it may impact the heterogeneous ice nucleation probability; however, we currently do not have an explanation for the increased freezing temperatures for particle concentrations greater than 27 wt%.Increase in freezing temperature ΔT vs aqueous concentration of particles when dust is present in the aqueous particles. ΔT = T heterogeneous freezing − T homogeneous freezing . The dotted line is only to guide the eye. The elevation of freezing temperature for particles with kaolinite and montmorillonite inclusions is similar. has been used in the past to predict the homogeneous freezing temperatures of NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O particles: where T f is an effective homogeneous freezing temperature for particles of size comparable to our particles, ΔT m is the equilibrium melting point depression for a specific salt concentration and the homogeneous freezing of pure water droplets is fixed at 235.15 K. We used a similar expression to fit our median heterogeneous freezing temperatures of ice in NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O particles with dust immersions: The dashed curve in Figure 2 shows the agreement of our median freezing data for both kaolinite and montmorillonite with this expression, with an error of ±3 K... These studies had shown that high super-saturations with respect to ice 1.5 to 1.7 were required for homogeneous nucleation to occur at upper tropospheric conditions. In contrast, field measurements by Heymsfield and Miloshevich . Our results for heterogeneous nucleation of ice in NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O particles on kaolinite and montmorillonite are shown as open triangles and open circles, respectively. The thick solid line is a least squares fit to the data points. has suggested that homogeneous nucleation of ice from supercooled aqueous solutions is independent of the nature of the solute, and only depends on the supersaturation with respect to ice. Based on this, we ssuggest that our parameterization for the S ice * T for heterogeneous nucleation by dust immersions can be used to predict freezing in other types of aqueous particles as well, and not just in NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O particles.S ice * T can be calculated from S ice * T = A 0 T 2 + A 1 T + A 2 , where S ice * T is the critical ice saturation ratio and T is the temperature in K . These parameters are valid from 0 to 45 wt % NH 4 2 SO 4 .. The filled circles represent our data for heterogeneous freezing of ice in NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O-kaolinite and the open circles represent our data for NH 4 2 SO 4 -H 2 O-montmorillonite particles. The dashed-dotted line is the melting point curve shifted by Δa w = 0.305 and the thick line is the melting point curve shifted by Δa w = 0.242. See text for details.. Even though our data is in better agreement with available field data than the homogeneous freezing results, it still deviates significantly at low temperatures. Further work is required to understand quantitatively the effects of increased surface area and surface defects that may provide `active' sites for ice nucleation to occur."
299,dust climate aerosol atmosphere,"Sun/dust correlations and volcanic interference. [1] We examine the relationship between the GISP2 dust profile, a proxy for the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric dust load, and the Wolf sunspot number, a proxy for solar activity. The two records are positively correlated, but the phase of the relationship is disturbed by the effects of explosive volcanism. Similar correlation failures have already been noted for many other climatic indicators. Our work suggests that a large fraction of the correlation failures may be attributed to explosive volcanic activity.  that solar variability has modulated the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 GISP2 dust concentration profile at radiocarbon periods of 11, 22, 90 and 200 years. This sun/dust link was attributed to solar modulation of the terrestrial cosmic ray flux CRF , which can influence cloud cover and hence precipitation patterns and aridity. The dust modulations reported were for pre-Holocene ice, and it was not possible to compare their timings with actual changes in sunspot numbers SSN , which are only known for recent times. In an effort to determine the exact phasing between GISP2 dust modulations and the solar cycle, we used laser-light scattering LLS from meltwater to measure the variations in dust concentration along the top 120 m of GISP2 ice corresponding to the most recent 400 years, a period for which sunspot data are available. The resulting dust profile spans the period from 1598 to 1988 A.D. Figure 1 and has an average sampling frequency of more than 13 samples per year. Seasonal dust maxima i.e. annual layers are clearly resolved throughout the core and are used to corroborate the established GISP2 depth-age scale. We limited our analysis to the time period 1752 to 1988 A.D., for which our dust record is continuous. This is approximately the timespan covered by the Wolf monthly SSN, which we use as a proxy for the 11-year cycle of solar activity.The GISP2 dust concentration profile, in relative LLS units, from 1598 to 1988 A.D. The gray line represents the raw data, and the black line represents a 10-year moving Gaussian-weighted average. Instrumental error is less than 3% and the errors in dating are approximately 1%. Sections of ice, from 1698 to 1711 and from 1719 to 1727, as well as shorter sections at 1729, 1736, 1742, and 1751, were previously sampled and therefore unavailable to us for analysis and resulted in gaps in the dust profile.. The vertical gray bars indicate all volcanic eruptions from Lamb's Dust Veil Index DVI with global DVI equal to or greater than 100, as well as the so-called pre-Tambora eruption. The largest eruptions of the time period shown are labeled with the volcano name. and ion-induced nucleation of ultrafine aerosol particles see Figure 3 . Both mechanisms are enhanced by increases in the CRF, as for example during solar minima, but they have opposite effects on the atmospheric dust load. Electroscavenging of ice-forming nuclei increases contact ice nucleation and the production of precipitation by the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeison process, and appears to be the explanation for the results of  We used compositing, or epoch analysis, to determine if there is a detectable response of the sun/dust correlation to explosive, low-latitude volcanism. The analysis was limited to the eruptions in Lamb 's greater than 3, and are within 20° latitude from the equator, since such eruptions have the strongest effects on climate. We also included an unknown 1808 eruption hereafter referred to as pre-Tambora , which has been shown to be a low-latitude event comparable in magnitude to the 1883 eruption of Krakatau. The results of our epoch analysis are given in Figure 4 .Superposed epoch analysis of the effects of volcanic eruptions on the sun/dust moving correlation with n w equal to 10 years. Subsets of the data were chosen at the position of the selected key years, and averaged together to form a composite. The extracted epochs contain seven years preceding the key date and seven years following the key date, for a total length of 15 years. This minimizes the possibility that eruptions adjacent to each key date are included in the background calculation, and ensures that some of the background points in the composite are independent of the key date. The non-parametric methods of Prager and Hoenig . There is also no noticeable effect on the correlation by the 1963 eruption of Agung. This is consistent with the observations of Rampino and Self in their epoch analysis of δ 18 O from the same GISP2 ice core. They attributed this lag to possible core dating problems, which they believe could be off by as many as two years. After adjusting for this discrepancy, we find that the minimum in Figure 4b is significant at the 95% confidence level. These results give credence to our conjecture that the sharp shifts and failures in sun/dust correlation seen in Figure 2b could be due to volcanic effects.. Continental dust concentrations in ice cores were considerably higher in glacial pre-Holocene times than during the Holocene, and volcanic eruptions would have been less likely to mask sun/dust relationships. Indeed, dust concentration measurements on GISP2 pre-Holocene ice reveal very prominent solar modulations that stand out clearly above the background, more so than during the dust-quiet Holocene."
300,aerosol,"Dual-wavelength Raman lidar observations of the extinction-to-backscatter ratio of Saharan dust. [1] For the first time, height profiles of the extinction-to-backscatter ratio lidar ratio of desert dust particles were simultaneously measured at 355 and 532 nm. The observations were performed with an advanced Raman lidar during two long-range Saharan dust outbreaks at Leipzig, Germany 51.3degreesN, 12.4degreesE , in August and October 2001. Measured desert-dust lidar ratios are needed for a proper profiling of the climate-relevant volume extinction coefficient of the dust particles with widely used standard backscatter lidars. Unexpectedly large lidar ratios, mainly between 50 and 80 sr, were found in the Saharan dust plumes. The lidar ratios at 355 nm were, on average, higher by 10%-30% than the ones at 532 nm, probably due to enhanced light absorption in the UV. The large lidar ratios can be explained by model calculations, available in the literature for 532 nm, which focus on the deviations between the scattering characteristics of spheres and spheroids. . Dust is mostly produced by wind erosion in arid regions. Anthropogenic activities may significantly contribute to the total atmospheric mineral aerosol load. The Sahara is the most important source of mineral aerosols. Dust particles are raised to considerable heights by strong convection and can be transported over large distances.. However, to determine the climatically relevant profile of the volume extinction coefficient of particles with standard backscatter lidars, realistic values of the extinction-to-backscatter ratio are needed. Such observations are rare in the case of desert dust. concluded from spaceborne lidar observations over the eastern Atlantic Ocean that the Saharan-dust lidar ratio is between 25 and 35 sr.. The model calculations are used to explain the large lidar ratios. and the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network EARLINET Raman lidar observations of aerosols are conducted routinely at Leipzig, Germany, since 1997. The light source is a Nd:YAG laser which emits pulses at 355, 532, and 1064 nm with an overall pulse energy of 1.6 J and a repetition rate of 30 Hz. The backscattered signals are collected with a 1-m Cassegrain telescope receiver field-of-view of 0.4 mrad and detected with photomultipliers operated in photon-counting mode. The results presented here are based on the signals elastically backscattered at the three transmitted wavelengths and inelastically Raman backscattered by nitrogen molecules at 387 and 607 nm. On August 2–3, 2001, and October 13–15, 2001, two major Saharan dust plumes reached central Europe. These outbreaks were by far the strongest we observed since 1997 and thus allowed the most accurate calculations of the lidar ratio. Earlier measurements are in agreement with the findings presented here. According to backward trajectories personal communication, A. Stohl, University of Munich the dust observed over Leipzig in August and October, 2001, originated from Saharan regions between 10° N and 30° N, and 10° W and 15° E, and crossed northwestern Africa, Spain, and France before arriving at the lidar site. The dust clouds travelled 3000–5000 km within 4–5 days. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the dust cloud on August 2–3, 2001, in terms of the range-corrected signal at 1064 nm. Dust was found in the free troposphere up to 10-km height. The boundary layer reached up to about 1.5-km height. A strong frontal system west of the European continent initiated the advection of warm air from the Sahara region to Europe. The airmasses which arrived in heights above 6 km before 1500 UTC cf. Figure 1 crossed the desert regions in height levels of 5–6 km. The heavily loaded layer between 3- and 5-km height, observed after 1500 UTC, was located in the lower troposphere <1500-m height over the Sahara. In contrast, on October 13–15, 2001, a high pressure system over southern and southeastern Europe completely dominated the transport of dust from northern Africa to southwestern and central parts of Europe in the lowermost 6 km.Range-corrected signal at 1064 nm measured on August 2–3, 2001, 1242–0300 UTC 1352–0400 local time . Vertical and temporal resolution is 60 m and 30 s, respectively. Blue color indicates weak backscattering, green and red colors indicate backscattering mainly by dust particles above 2-km height , and white color shows cirrus 6–12-km height , water clouds 2–6-km height , and signal noise above the clouds.. The optical depths of the dust layers were about 0.26 3–10-km height, August 2 and 0.41 1–6 km, October 13 at 532 nm. The respective values of the free-tropospheric 355-nm particle optical depth were about 10% larger. Multiple scattering affects the extinction properties by less than 2% as our simulations show.Particle backscatter coefficient, extinction coefficient, and lidar ratio of Saharan dust. The measurement was performed on August 2, 2001, 1921–2117 UTC. Before calculating the scattering properties the signal profiles were smoothed with a window length of 60 m backscatter profile and, in the case of the extinction and lidar-ratio profiles, with window lengths of 660 m for heights <5.3 km, 1260 m 532 nm, >5.3 km , 1860 m 355 nm, 5.3–10 km , and 1260 m 355 nm, >10 km . The error bars indicate one standard deviation caused by statistical and systematic errors.Same as Figure 2 except the time of observation October 13, 2001, 1730–2007 UTC and the signal smoothing length of 600 m in the case of the extinction and lidar-ratio profiles. Relatively large lidar ratios were also measured after long-range transport of Asian desert dust over Japan. Here, the lidar ratio at the measured wavelength of 523 nm varied between 40 and 75 sr within the dust layer which stretched from 2–6-km height. From three-wavelength lidar measurements in lofted Saharan dust layers near Barbados,  As can be seen from Figure 4 , the backscatter coefficient at 532 nm for spheroids is considerably lower and the lidar ratio is much larger than the respective values for spheres. After applying correction factors of 2–3, the lidar ratio for spheres is about 22–33 sr in the 2–3.5-km layer and thus in the range predicted from Mie calculations.[14]  The consistency between the observational findings and the model calculations supports our hypothesis that the dust lidar ratio is largely influenced by the shape effect. On the other hand, the good agreement also indicates that the model is adequate to describe the scattering characteristics of dust-like particles.[15]  In summary, we have measured the extinction-to-backscatter ratio of Saharan dust at two wavelengths in the UV and visible wavelength region. Unexpectedly large lidar ratios probably were caused by the combined effect of long-range transport and non-spherical shape of the particles. As a conclusion, extinction profiling with standard backscatter lidar presently remains very uncertain. More lidar-ratio observations in combination with airmass backward trajectory analysis and, if possible, in combination with in situ aircraft observations of the particle size distribution, shape, and composition are needed for realistic assessments of the long-range influence of dust plumes on the planetary energy balance."
301,dust ocean,"TOMS and METEOSAT satellite records of the variability of Saharan dust transport over the Atlantic during the last two decades (1979-1997). [1] We combined aerosol observations of TOMS/Nimbus-7 1979-1993 and Meteosat/ VIS 1984-1997 to investigate the variability of Saharan dust transport over the Atlantic over nearly 20 years. We first used three years 1986-1988 of coincident daily Meteosat images over the northern tropical Atlantic 15-30degreesN, 5-30degreesW to convert the TOMS semi-quantitative index into dust optical thickness by means of two ""winter'' and ""summer'' linear relationships. We then processed the whole TOMS/Nimbus-7 archive and found that both seasonal and interannual variability of the mean dust optical thickness over the Atlantic retrieved by TOMS and Meteosat are consistent. This consistency offers an unique opportunity to monitor the export of Saharan dust over the Atlantic during the last two decades. This analysis provides the first evidence of the high year-to-year variability of dust transport during winter, and confirms the importance of meteorological factors, through the North Atlantic Oscillation, in affecting its occurrence at this season. , but the African dust export is in turn strongly controlled by climate variability. In-situ measurements of mineral dust concentration at Barbados since the 1960's clearly show, on a year-to-year basis, the association of dry conditions in northern Africa with enhanced long-range transport of Saharan dust in summer. . For the TOMS/Nimbus-7 instrument, the AI was determined using the 340- and 380-nm bands. Briefly, the AI relies on the spectral attenuation of the Rayleigh scattering due to aerosol absorption. The AI is defined so that positive values generally correspond to UV-absorbing aerosols e.g., desert dust and carbonaceous particles and negative values correspond to non-absorbing aerosols e.g., sulfate aerosols . Thus we selected the positive values of the AI defined here as the AAI absorbing aerosol index . The TOMS/Nimbus-7 data used in this work are daily gridded level-3 product at a resolution of 1°latitude x 1.25°longitude available from November 1978 to May 1993. relies on former works by . Note that the contribution of both stratospheric and tropospheric sulfates is corrected for within the DOT inversion procedure.. We selected the 3-year period ranging from 1986 to 1988 to perform the comparison between TOMS AAI and Meteosat DOT because it is when the calibration of both sensors is the most stable. Daily maps of Meteosat DOT were projected on the TOMS grid to allow direct comparison between the two aerosol products. Given the respective resolution of both products, one TOMS grid cell can be filled with up to 20 clear-sky Meteosat DOT cells. have shown that the AAI is sensitive to the altitude of the aerosol layer, as predicted by theoretical simulations. Saharan dust being transported at relatively low altitude during winter in comparison to the high altitude transport of summer, we perform the comparison for a “winter” period October to March and a “summer” period April to September . Further analysis on a monthly and quaterly basis have shown that such a division of the year into two extended seasons is suitable to account for the seasonal variations in the height of the dust transport.. Our results also confirm that the ratio AAI/DOT increases with increasing altitude of the aerosol layer.Relation between daily TOMS AAI and Meteosat DOT retrievals for the northern tropical Atlantic zone for “Winter” October to March 86–88, and for “Summer” April to September 86–88. Note that data for which TOMS AAI or Meteosat DOT is equal to zero have been removed. The range of Meteosat DOT 0 to 2.5 has been divided into 10 classes of 0.25 DOT wide. For each class the mean Meteosat DOT, the mean TOMS AAI and standard deviations are computed. The linear regressions between the mean TOMS AAI and mean Meteosat DOT are in “Winter” for DOT lower than 1.75 filled circles , AAI = 1.41 * DOT + 0.31, r = 0.999; in “Summer” for DOT lower than 1.5 filled circles , AAI = 2.32 * DOT + 0.65, r = 0.999. and   Figure 2 suggests that there is an important year-to-year variability of the winter transport of Saharan dust; it is almost absent for some years e.g., 1986 or of an intensity almost equal to that of the summer transport for other years e.g. 1989 . Figure 3 reports the year to year variations of the winter mean DOT December–March derived from TOMS Nimbus 7 1979 to 1993 and from Meteosat 1984 to 1997 over the northern tropical Atlantic. During the 10 years of coincident observations, although TOMS leads generally to slightly lower DOT than Meteosat, the year to year variations of the DOT retrieved by the two instruments are well correlated r = 0.92 . Both TOMS and Meteosat show that the dust transport occurring during the winter season is highly variable from year to year. It varies by a factor of three between 1984 and 1992 whereas both annual and summer transports vary only by a factor of 1.5. The contribution of this winter transport of dust to the total annual transport varies from 9% in 1986 to 30% in 1989. This suggests that the winter transport has a significant impact on the interannual variability of Saharan dust export.Comparison between the North Atlantic Oscillation NAO index bold continuous line and the mean dust optical thickness DOT in winter December–March derived from TOMS Nimbus 7 from 1979 to 1993 open circles and from Meteosat from 1984 to 1997 filled circles over the northern tropical Atlantic zone. from the difference between normalized sea-level atmospheric pressures between Lisbon, Portugal, and Stykkisholmur, Iceland. The NAO Index covaries with the winter DOT as inferred by TOMS r = 0.67 from 1979 to 1993 and Meteosat r = 0.74 from 1984 to 1997 . These correlation coefficients are improved in comparison to those reported in .Maps of the winter January–March TOMS Absorbing aerosol index for 1986 and 1989, corresponding respectively to a low-NAO year NAO Indice = 0.5 and a high-NAO year NAO Indice = 5.07 . The analysis of TOMS and Meteosat Saharan dust observations is performed for the oceanic part of the zone indicated on the images 15–30°N, 5–30°W .. This latter sensor is different from its predecessor and the efficiency of this new approach for the monitoring of the year-to-year variability of Saharan dust export would have to be investigated."
302,aerosol,"Sunphotometric observations of the 2001 Asian dust storm over Canada and the US. [1] Sunphotometry, supported by TOMS imagery and the NRL-NAAPS global aerosol model, was used to monitor the 2001 springtime Asian dust plume across Canada and the U. S. Comparative analysis between these data sets indicated that the dust plume was remarkable in its extent and persistence and that its evolution could be inferred at western, mid-western and eastern sunphotometer stations for a period of about a week. The dust influence on sunphotmeter monthly statistics is shown to be weak, but systematic. . . On a climatological scale, . Seven sites in the northern U.S. and southern Canada Table 1 were chosen for study in part because they lay within the path of the plume and in part from a geographical sampling strategy which was to observe the dust influence over a pan-North American scale. The Canadian sites are part of the AEROCAN network which is itself a federated member of AERONET. The Roger's Dry Lake site in California is well south of the rest of the stations but was retained to illustrate the southward extent of the measurable optical parameters. Two 4-channel Middleton SP01-A sunphotometers were employed at Bratt's Lake since the CIMEL at the site was temporarily out of order. No operational cloud screening procedure is applied to the output of the SP01-A instruments; these data were accordingly processed with a cloud screening procedure similar to that of AERONET. 1 1. The four-channel, sky radiance database is distinct from and of significantly lesser sampling frequency than the seven-channel sunphotometric database. Calculations of α on the latter database were performed using the four-channel AERONET definition.. The sign of the index is indicative of the presence of absorbing or scattering aerosols positive or negative respectively . The fact that TOMS operates in the optically thick UV region ensures a crude form of vertical discrimination in that detectable signals are limited to higher altitudes.. The model is characterized by a spatial resolution of 1° by 1° and is driven by the meteorological analysis of the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System NOGAPS . Data from the model were available at 6-hour intervals. the level of spatio-temporal coherence between the NAAPS predictions and the AI image seems quite reasonable.TOMS aerosol index AI images overlain with NAAPS >0.1 dust optical depth DOD contours and showing the seven sunphotometer stations listed in Table 1 . The digital scale on the color bar which is adjusted to vary between 0 and 5 is proportional to the AI in Figure 2 . The end points of the Sherbrooke and Howland dust events were, for example, contaminated by an influx of small aerosols which appear as an increase in the measured values of AOD and α and which the NAAPS model appears to support in the form of a sulfate peak. In general the vertical-line dust limits of Figure 2 are conservative and the dust event duration in the cases of sites such as Missoula probably lasted longer than indicated. Bratt's Lake was of particular interest given its boundary position on the northern edge of the major plume seen in Figure 1 and given that there was a cloud ceilometer at this site. This latter instrument indicated thick cloud until the 14th and the afternoon of the 15th and clear conditions on the 16th and the mornings of the 15th, 17th and 18th. Thin mid-altitude structure from about 3 to greater than 8 km could be observed in the afternoons of the 17th and 18th. These observations combined with the TOMS and NAAPS information suggested that the ceilometer was most likely insensitive to the dust plume since the cloud screened AOD increased smoothly and significantly on the 16th while α decreased smoothly and significantly in the absence of any detectable vertical structure. The vertical structure observable in the ceilometer data of the 17th and 18th was probably due to inhomogeneous thin cloud and thus the increase in AOD is attributable to thin homogeneous cloud or dust AODs which survived the elimination threshold of |dAOD/dt| > 0.001/minute ., is weak but nonetheless systematic.δΔτ g is the change in the lognormal std. dev. as viewed on a linear AOD axis.. The relatively low scatter of the coarse mode distribution C vc compared with the fine mode distribution C vf shows that coarse particles dominate the AOD behavior. Given that the retrieved volume-weighted average coarse mode radius r vc was found to be only marginally dependent on AOD correlation coefficient = 0.29 one can state that the DOD variations are largely determined by abundance integrated number density changes in the coarse mode. The generally lower scatter of C vc in Figure 3 is quantified for the case of all dust points as well as for each individual station in Table 3 . The all-station slope of C vc versus AOD 1020 and the value of r vc are similar to the retrievals of  Dust clouds from the April 2001 Asian dust event were tracked across Canada and the northern U.S. using sunphotometry supported by TOMS data and the NAAPS model. Comparisons between these data sets indicated that the dust plume evolution could be inferred at all the sunphotometer stations. It is remarkable that the Asian dust cloud was sufficiently persistent and thick to be detectable across the breadth of North America for a period of about a week. Optical statistics for this period illustrated how the dust influence was weak but systematic. Indeed, the spatial and temporal persistence of the dust indicates that some consideration should be given to springtime dust events in seasonal AOD climatologies.[14]  AOD variations during the dust event were dominated by coarse mode volume variations which in turn were largely attributable to changes in particle number rather than size r vc was relatively constant at ∼1.8 μm . The weak variation of particle size implies that processes such as differential sedimentation are relatively unimportant in an aged dust cloud and that detailed microphysical modeling of the size spectra of dust may not be necessary under these conditions."
303,ocean,"Coupling between cycles of phytoplankton biomass and aerosol optical depth as derived from SeaWiFS time series in the Subantarctic Southern Ocean. [1] The Subantarctic Southern Ocean is a high-nutrient low-chlorophyll region, and it has been suggested that primary production is limited by deep mixing and the availability of iron. Australian dust is high in iron content and can be transported over the Subantarctic Southern Ocean, particularly during the austral spring and summer when dust storm frequency in southern Australia is maximal. We present evidence for a coupling between satellite-derived SeaWiFS aerosol optical thickness and chlorophyll concentration in the upper ocean. The coupling is evident at monthly, weekly and daily timescales. Although the monthly coherence is likely to be due to other covarying factors, the coupling at weekly and daily timescales supports the hypothesis that the episodic atmospheric delivery of iron is stimulating phytoplankton growth. We also discuss the impact of oceanic dimethylsulfide production on aerosol concentration in the study region. . This region is a zone of high-nitrate and low-chlorophyll HNLC , although silicate levels are low year round and may limit diatom growth rate. Satellite imagery suggests that a classical spring phytoplankton bloom event is not typical of these waters, however biomass is enhanced during spring–summer and depressed in winter. Multiple factors may control algal production in HNLC regions, including, availability of light, iron limitation and herbivore grazing. and Southern Ocean. On all occasions, raising the iron level in the water by a few nanomoles per litre produced a significant increase in algal biomass. A major natural source of new iron to open ocean surface waters is continentally derived aeolian dust, which supplies about three times the fluvial input. . Iron fertilisation and DMS production are also linked, as demonstrated by  Our study area Figure 1 covers the latitudinal band between 40°–53°S, upwind of the atmospheric baseline station at Cape Grim, Tasmania 40°41′S, 144°41′E . Analysis of atmospheric data at Cape Grim has confirmed the connection between DMS and sulfate aerosols. Local paleoenvironmental records suggest a link between enhanced delivery of aeolian dust and increased marine productivity during the last two glacials.. Aeolian delivery of iron can influence both the oceanic sulfur cycle and the oxidation of DMS in the remote marine atmosphere.  Here we present evidence that algal biomass in the upper ocean is strongly correlated with aerosol optical depth AOD over our study region. We propose two closely linked hypotheses that may explain this coupling, i the episodic delivery of iron-enriched, Australian dust is enhancing in situ algal production, and ii the production of DMS and subsequent formation of sulfate aerosols are contributing to changes in AOD levels.. The AOD is mainly influenced by aerosols in the marine boundary layer height: 0–1000 m , and scattering by aerosols in the size fraction below 10 μm in diameter.. The oceanic mixed layer varies from a mid-summer minimum of around 60m to over 400 m in winter and early spring. Synoptic meteorology is dominated by frequent west-east passage of frontal systems. Monthly mean wind speeds vary from 11 ms −1 in January to 7 ms −1 in June. Cloud cover is high throughout the year, and the annual range of daily mean surface temperature at Cape Grim is 9–14°C. Because of proximity to the Australian continent, baseline conditions at Cape Grim prevail for only 35–40% of the time.. The vernal northerly migration of the band of cold fronts contributes to increased dust storm activity over eastern Australia. There is thus strong seasonality in monthly average dust storm frequency related to wind conditions, rainfall, and vegetation patterns, with peak dust storm activity in southern Australia occurring during summer. Considerable quantities of Australian dust have contributed to Tasman Sea sediments. Analysis of air-parcel trajectories during the passage of an intense depression in May 1994 suggests that dust can be transported over our region as far as 52°S.. At present, both the mineral aerosol composition and solubility of associated Fe are not well known in the study region. Adopting a conservative dust loading range of 100–1000 mg m −2 yr −1 , and an Fe-content of 5%, the approximate total Fe-loading is in the range 5–500 mg m −2 yr −1 . If 10–50% of the Fe is in soluble bioavailable form, this implies a loading of 0.5–250 mg m −2 yr −1 . Strong seasonality in dust activity in southern Australia Figure 2 , suggests much of this Fe-rich dust is will be deposited during spring and summer.Mean monthly Dust Storm Index values Sept 1997–Dec 1999 for 37 locations within 400 km of the southern coastline of Australia., show that aerosols in the lower marine boundary layer are composed of four size fractions: ultrafine mode 5–20 nm diameter , Aitken 20–80 nm , accumulation mode 80–300 nm and a coarse mode >300 nm . Oceanic emissions of DMS contribute to the 20–300 nm particle size range, with sea-salt dominating the coarse mode. . Although this does not prove a causal link between CCN and AOD, it is consistent with such a hypothesis.Annual cycles of MSA, CCN and satellite-derived AOD at Cape Grim and the algal community during late spring is dominated by diatoms , however algal growth response to the addition of soluble Fe is more rapid 2–3 days . A coupling at the daily time scale is thus strongly suggestive of Fe stimulation of algal production.Correlation between monthly averaged satellite-derived CHL and AOD data in study region.Correlation between satellite-derived AOD and CHL for 8-day averages.Correlation between satellite-derived AOD and CHL for daily data during January 1998.[14]  In summary, we have observed significant correlation between satellite derived AOD and CHL in our study region. The coupling is evident at daily, weekly and monthly time scales, although the longer time scale correlation is probably indicative of a seasonal forcing of both signals. The coherence at shorter time scales is more difficult to dismiss, and seems to support the hypotheses that atmospheric delivery of Fe is stimulating phytoplankton growth rate and possibly DMS-derived aerosol production."
304,particles climate aerosol,"A glaciation indirect aerosol effect caused by soot aerosols. [1] Anthropogenic aerosols can influence the climate indirectly by changing the optical properties and precipitation formation of water clouds. An indirect effect that has not been considered involves the subset of anthropogenic aerosols that act as ice nuclei and thereby determines the lifetime of ice and mixed-phase clouds. If, in addition to mineral dust, a fraction of the hydrophilic soot aerosol particles is assumed to act as contact ice nuclei as evident from recent laboratory studies, then increases in aerosol concentration from pre-industrial times to present-day pose a new indirect effect, a ""glaciation indirect effect'', on clouds. Here increases in contact ice nuclei in the present-day climate result in more frequent glaciation of clouds and increase the amount of precipitation via the ice phase. This effect can at least partly offset the solar indirect aerosol effect on water clouds. , but is still very uncertain. Since natural ice nuclei are scarce especially at small supercoolings, anthropogenic ice nuclei can potentially be a very important contributor to glaciation of supercooled clouds. However, the connection between aerosols and ice clouds is presently considered to be too uncertain to even speculate on whether it would be a positive or negative radiative climate forcing.. On the contrary, if all contact nuclei are assumed to be insoluble carbonaceous aerosols then contact nucleation is more important.. Therefore anthropogenic aerosol and precursor emissions are unlikely to have an effect on cirrus formed by homogeneous freezing.. They found that the fraction of soot particles forming ice crystals increased with decreasing temperature, increasing size of the aerosol particles and with the degree of oxidation of the soot particle surface. If soot was oxidized, the surface chemical groups could form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Because hydrogen bonds on the surface of an ice nucleus reduce the free energy for embryo formation, they make soot a very potent source of contact ice nuclei. Evidence for carbonaceous material as ice nuclei was also found in contrails and some cirrus clouds. If, on the other hand, sufficient contact ice nuclei IN are present, more ice particles IP can be formed. This would lead to more frequent glaciation of supercooled clouds as the ice crystals grow rapidly at the expense of the droplets in a high ice supersaturated environment so that more precipitation is formed. As a consequence, the cloud fraction would decrease thus allowing more shortwave radiation to be absorbed in the Earth-atmosphere system. to estimate the importance of contact nucleation of black carbon aerosols on a global scale. The GCM includes a fully coupled aerosol-cloud microphysics module. ECHAM4 solves prognostic equations for the mass mixing ratio of dimethyl sulfide, sulfur dioxide, sulfate aerosols, methane sulfonic acid, hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic and black carbon aerosols, respectively, dust and sea salt aerosols, cloud liquid water and cloud ice mixing ratio and number concentrations of cloud droplets and ice crystals. Transport, dry and wet deposition, and chemical transformations of the aerosols and gaseous precursors are calculated on line with the GCM. Soot ice activation fractions at −20°C for typical sizes of soot particles in the atmosphere were estimated to be high enough to account for 1 ice nucleus l −1 , or nearly 10% of the typically observed concentrations suggesting a potent role for hydrophilic soot to act as ice nuclei. In ECHAM, we distinguish between hydrophobic and hydrophilic black carbon. Applying Gorbunov's finding, we conduct three sensitivity experiments in which we adjust the fraction of hydrophilic black carbon soot particles assumed to act as ice nuclei from 0% simulation BC0% , to 1% simulation BC1% and 10% simulation BC10% . However, in order to evaluate whether BC1% or BC10% is the more reasonable scenario, more laboratory and field studies on the ice forming potential of soot are necessary. Next to contact nucleation anthropogenic aerosols could influence supercooled clouds by other heterogeneous freezing mechanisms immersion freezing and condensation freezing which are not considered here but should be included in future studies. and ice water content IWC  The increase in Northern Hemisphere N.H. aerosol burden is largest in the low and mid latitudes in BC0% because of a positive feedback. The higher aerosol concentrations result in more cloud condensation nuclei and more cloud droplets. Clouds with more but smaller cloud droplets do not form precipitation as readily as clouds with larger cloud droplets so that the N.H. liquid water path increases most BC0% and the N.H. precipitation decreases in BC0% in present-day times as compared to pre-industrial times. Thus, less aerosols are removed from the atmosphere by in-cloud and below-cloud scavenging but are available as cloud condensation nuclei. The more but smaller cloud droplets reflect more shortwave radiation back to space without any systematic effect on the outgoing longwave radiation. who detected a positive correlation between cloud optical thickness and aerosol number concentration but did not find a dependence of the liquid water path on aerosol number.Relative changes in % with respect to pre-industrial values are added in parenthesis.[17]  Whereas the net shortwave radiation in BC0% and BC1% decreases between pre-industrial times and present-day, it actually increases in BC10% because of an overall reduction in cloud amount. This, in turn, causes more longwave radiation to be emitted to space, which drives the decrease in net radiation of 1.6 W m −2 in BC10% from pre-industrial to present-day times. In BC0%, on the other hand, the longwave radiation hardly changes so that the decrease in net radiation of 1.4 W m −2 from pre-industrial to present-day times is driven by the decrease in shortwave radiation. Although the differences due to the fraction of soot serving as contact nuclei on the net radiation are small, the signs of the shortwave and longwave radiation can be completely reversed.[18]  In summary, if a non-negligible fraction of soot aerosols acts as ice nuclei, the glaciation indirect aerosol effect could reverse or at least reduce the effect that anthropogenic aerosols have on the shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere."
411,aerosol,"Infrared dust spectral signatures from AIRS. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder AIRS on board NASA's Aqua satellite platform is a hypersectral IR temperature and humidity sounder for numerical weather prediction and climate change studies. We use the rich spectral information available in the AIRS thermal infrared radiances to study the spectral signatures of dust over ocean for four case studies, and to retrieve dust optical depths using a fast two-stream radiative transfer model. Retrieved optical depths for one case, a dust storm spreading over the Eastern Mediterranean in October 2002, are compared with visible imagery and MODIS optical depth retrievals. This work represents a preliminary step to removing the effects of dust on the retrieval of temperature and water vapor from the AIRS measurements. . Dust storms can also affect atmospheric chemistry and rainfall patterns, and transport micronutrients and microorganisms. The deposited dust can kill coral, fertilize ocean photoplankton which absorb more CO2, or melt ice as dust makes that surface absorb rather than reflect sunlight. Dust storms are now more frequent, in part because of climatic variability and in part because of land use change such as deforestation or overgrazing. instrument was designed to provide improved temperature and humidity profiles for numerical weather prediction and long-term climate studies. However, the effects of dust on measured AIRS radiances can negatively impact the retrievals of these profiles. With an almost complete high-spectral coverage of the 9–12 μm atmospheric window spectrum, AIRS radiances contain much information about clouds and aerosols, allowing the retrieval of infrared IR optical depths τ ν of mineral dust as well as possibly correcting for dust in the retrieval algorithm. absorb less at the 800 and 1200 cm −1 regions than at 960 cm −1 , yielding a “V” shaped depression of the Brightness Temperature BT across the thermal IR window. By testing for this, AIRS spectral data can be queried for dust contamination day or night. Examination of atmospheric parameters retrieved from contaminated fields of view FOVs shows that dust negatively impacts the retrievals, degrading the use of AIRS in weather forecasting over the vast regions that dust can spread into.. The dust is indicated by bias values coded in red to green. The nominal AIRS noise level is coded in white. AIRS radiances clearly measure the immense extent and variability of dust carried by the atmosphere across the Atlantic , coinciding in time and space with the breeding ground for hurricanes, when satellite observations are critical for weather forecasting. To that end, this paper shows that the adverse effects of dust can be accounted for in the retrieval radiative transfer algorithm, and possibly removed from the AIRS radiances. AIRS observations can also be used to estimate the change in outgoing longwave radiative flux OLR at the top of the atmosphere TOA that impacts the Earth's radiation budget.BTD bias differences between AIRS channels at 961 and 1231 cm −1 , for July 2003, for FOVS passing a stringent uniformity test. The plot shows the long range transport of Saharan Dust across the Atlantic. Using the retrieved atmospheric fields from these contaminated FOVs could lead to erroneous weather forecasting during the hurricane season.. Here we analyze the detailed AIRS spectral information from multiple spectra, using a fast scattering radiative transfer algorithm to retrieve dust thermal IR optical depths. The scattering code is based on the two-stream approximation, and makes use of the refractive indices of a “Sahara dust” model. Our dust retrieval attempts to minimize the obs-calc BTD biases of channels in the thermal IR window channels. Some of these channels are used by the retrieval algorithms at various Numerical Weather Prediction centers, so an ability to correct for dust effects may allow for more reliable retrievals..

Note the notch feature between 860 and 880 cm −1 is strongest in curves b and c and almost absent from curves a and d. Optical depth retrievals of thermal IR data from AIRS radiances show good correlation with retrieved MODIS optical depths. A careful use of the rich spectral information available in the AIRS thermal IR channels shows the worldwide extent of dust contamination, and makes possible day and night retrievals which significantly reduce BTD biases across the thermal IR window. This should improve current AIRS retrievals that can be negatively affected by the presence of dust. Residual biases show that a more accurate refractive index model should be used, possibly including a carbonate species. Continuation of this research should yield a quality assurance dust flag for use with AIRS retrievals as well as possible removal of the effects of the dust before the cloud clearing stage."
413,aerosol,"The spectral radiative signature of wind-blown mineral dust: Implications for remote sensing in the thermal IR region. [1] This study investigates how the loading and composition of atmospheric dust affect IR radiances observed by satellite narrowband and high-resolution sensors. To compute monochromatic radiances accounting for multiple scattering and absorption by aerosols and atmospheric gases, we employed a new radiative transfer code which combines the line-by-line algorithm and discrete ordinate technique. New dust optical models required for such computations were developed for the representative mineral mixtures. We demonstrate that dust decreases the brightness temperature observed by satellite sensors depending mainly on the dust burden and composition, though the sensitivity to the composition differs between the satellite sensors. We found that mineral dust has a unique radiative signature termed here a ""negative slope'' which separates the effect of dust from that of clouds and gases. We conclude that dust must be accounted for in atmospheric correction algorithms if the retrievals of the sea surface temperature and atmospheric gaseous species from the thermal IR radiances are to be of high accuracy. . For instance, Ackerman . The DISORT code is used to solve the radiative transfer equation with multiple scattering. HITRAN-96 database was used to provide the line parameter input for line-by-line calculations. The HITRAN database consists of about million lines of 36 atmospheric gaseous species, which all were included in our calculations. The vertical profile of gaseous species and structure of the atmosphere temperature, pressure, density as a function of altitude were taken from the standard atmospheric models. In particular, we considered several atmospheric models e.g., Tropic and U.S. 1976 to cover the range of atmospheric conditions in the regions frequently affected by dust transport. Calculations of monochromatic radiances require high spectral resolution aerosol models in the IR region. Although basic physics of absorption and scattering by particulate matter is well understood, the quantitative prediction of aerosol effects in the IR remains an unresolved issue. In particular, we are not aware of any aerosol model specifically designed for high spectral resolution remote sensing.. Since atmospheric dust is a mixture of various mineral species, it is critical to account for its composition. Following the approach described by Sokolik and Toon . These compositional mixtures result in distinct spectral optical characteristics in the IR spectral region. The presence of dust decreases the brightness temperature in all narrowband channels. This decrease is largely controlled by the dust loading. However, some channels are more sensitive to the dust composition than the others. In particular, the MODIS 8.4–8.7 μm channel is extremely sensitive to dust composition because this range of wavelengths partly covers the main absorbing bands of clays and quartz. The magnitude of the negative slope is not too sensitive to dust composition and thus can be used to retrieve the dust optical depth in this spectral region. In contrast, the region about 1099–1220 cm −1 8.2–9.1 μm is very sensitive to dust composition and can provide important constrains on dust mixtures. Thus, the high spectral resolution remote sensing provides the unique capability in characterizing the properties of wind-blown atmospheric dust. In this paper we estimated the effect of atmospheric mineral dust on the IR radiances observed by the narrowband and high-resolution sensors. We demonstrated that the presence of dust decreases the brightness temperature depending mainly on the dust loading, though the composition becomes important as the loading increases. The moderate dust loading can result in a decrease of brightness temperature by 5–10 K in the IR window over the oceans. Given the SST desirable accuracy of about 0.2 K, even the light dust loading can causes non negligible errors..[19]  We conclude that narrowband satellite sensors are capable of detecting dust but the quantitative characterization of dust properties requires a higher spectral resolution. The potential of high spectral resolution remote sensing in providing compositional information is especially important since no other means of remote sensing from space are capable of providing such data.[20]  In turn, dust must be included in atmospheric correction algorithms if the retrievals of the sea surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor and trace gases from the thermal and near IR radiances are to be of high accuracy.[21]  An additional analysis will be required to demonstrate whether a dust spectral signal can be uniquely identified from the measurements over the land, because the spectral emissivity of various surfaces can mask the dust effect on the TOA radiances."
407,aerosol,"Asian Dust Storm Monitoring Combining Terra and Aqua MODIS SRB Measurements. Sand and dust storms SDSs , which present environmental risks and affect the regional climate, have been worsened in the East Asian regions over the last decade. Monitoring SDS from space using satellite remote sensing RS has become one of the most important issues in this field. At present, satellite RS of SDS is limited to using true-color images or aerosol optical thickness AOT , or a new algorithm called ""Deep Blue"". Using current existing approaches makes it difficult to identify SDS from clouds. The authors have detected SDS by combining Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS solar reflectance band SRB measurements. Based on the dust spectral characteristic, this letter proposes a normalized difference dust index NDDI using MODIS reflectance measurements and applies it to the Asian SDS cases. The simple NDDI index is found to be able to identify SDS and clouds easily. The results suggest that NDDI could be used to detect SDS over bright surfaces where the MODIS AOT product is not available Asian sand and dust storms SDSs are a very important environmental issue, and one of the major natural hazards in the Mongolian regions and northern China , . Several international collaborative programs, such as the Aerosol Characterization Experiment ACE -Asia and Asian Dust Network AD-Net , have been established . There have been limited works attempting integrated approaches to study dust and pollution haze. Earlier works have produced results based on true-color images or aerosol optical thickness AOT , but there are no MODIS AOT measurements over bright surface regions, such as desert regions. Miller demonstrated a new satellite-based multispectral radiometer technique for daytime enhancement of airborne dust over water and land using MODIS measurements [9] . The Deep Blue minimum of 412-nm reflectance as a gridded background approach has also been used to physically retrieve aerosol optical properties, even over bright surfaces, such as bright desert, semiarid, and urban background [10] .In this letter, we describe a new index using MODIS channels centered near 0.469 and 2.13 \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ for Asian dust detection, and apply the index to a pair of Terra and Aqua MODIS data sets. We also discuss the index threshold to distinguish the thick airborne dust storm from the surface features.MODIS has three different spatial resolutions including 250 m bands 1–2 , 500 m bands 3–7 , and the 1-km bands 8–36 . There are a total of 20 solar reflectance bands SRBs 1–19 and 26 from 0.41–2.13 \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ [11] .There are spectral signatures for hundreds of materials in the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ASTER spectrum library, which is used as a reference for material identification [12] . We analyzed the spectral signatures of sand, grass, soil, urban residential, and water in the ASTER spectrum library and cloud signatures from J. Dozier http://www.brenucsb.edu/fac_staff/fac/dozier/Talks/RSS.mht!RSS_files/frame.htm . The reflectance of water and ice cloud, sand, grass, soil, urban residential, and water, and the locations of MODIS SRB bands 0.4–2.5 \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ , are shown in Fig. 1 . It is clear that the reflectance of dust sand and soil generally increases with wavelength between 0.4 and 2.5 \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ with a minimum value in MODIS band 3 0.469 \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ and a maximum value in MODIS band 7 2.13 \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ . This spectrum characteristic of sand and soil makes it easy to distinguish SDS from cloud, which has the highest reflectance in MODIS band 3. Therefore, SDS features can be discerned using the dust spectrum characteristics as described here.
Reflectance of water and ice cloud, sand, grass, soil, urban residential, and water in the 0.4–2.5- \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ spectrum.View AllSeveral indices have been proposed based on the spectrum characteristics, e.g., Gao proposed the normalized difference water index NDWI for monitoring vegetation water content with the 0.86- \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ band and either the 1.64- \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ band or the 2.13- \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ band [13] .The spectral characteristic of sand suggests that strong SDS signals can be obtained using the difference between the 2.13- \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ band signal, which is high, and the 0.469- \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ band, where the signal is relatively much lower. This difference distinguishes rather well between SDS and water or ice clouds. Because of this strong discrimination possibility, we propose an NDDI to detect SDS. The NDDI can be written as $$\hbox{NDDI} = \rho_{2.13\ , \mu {\rm m}} - \rho_{0.469\ , \mu {\rm m}} / \rho_{2.13\ , \mu{\rm m}} + \rho_{0.469\ , \mu{\rm m}} \eqno{\hbox{ 1 }}$$ View Source \hbox{NDDI} = \rho_{2.13\ , \mu {\rm m}} - \rho_{0.469\ , \mu {\rm m}} / \rho_{2.13\ , \mu{\rm m}} + \rho_{0.469\ , \mu{\rm m}} \eqno{\hbox{ 1 }} where \$\rho_{2.13\ , \mu{\rm m}}\$ and \$\rho_{0.469\ , \mu{\rm m}}\$ are reflectances at the top of atmosphere TOA in the 2.13- and 0.469- \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ bands, respectively.To investigate the feasibility of NDDI for detecting SDS, we studied nine cases of SDS over the Gobi region and analyzed the NDDI ranges of dust, cloud, and surface features. For clouds, the NDDI value is negative NDDI \$<\$ 0.0 because of the higher reflectance at the 0.469- \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ band and lower reflectance at the 2.13- \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ band. We found that the NDDI values of surface features are less than 0.28, while the NDDI values of dust pixels are higher than 0.28, over the Gobi desert areas. It suggests that NDDI can effectively separate SDS from water or ice clouds and ground features except ground sand and dust in Gobi regions with a threshold of 0.28. To identify airborne and ground sand and dust, we analyzed the brightness temperature BT of MODIS band 31 10.78–11.28 \$\mu\hbox{m}\$ Fig. 2 . Airborne sand and dust pixels are cooler compared with ground sand and dust. By checking the BT of band 31, SDS can be separated from ground sand and dust. In the study area, the BT threshold of 275 K is used to determine the airborne or ground sand and dust. The thermal method has greatly reduced errors of commission.

Fig. 3 a shows a subsetted true-color image of SDS across the Gobi desert in Northern China and Southern Mongolia from the Terra/MODIS at 3:40 UTC, March 27, 2004. About 70 million people in 11 provinces were affected by this SDS on March 27 and 28 according to the Chinese news agency. This SDS was the worst of recent SDSs in Inner Mongolia http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/ . The solid line in Fig. 3 a is the country boundary between China and Mongolia. Fig. 4 a shows the subsetted and mosaicked true-color image for the same region from Aqua/MODIS at 05:15 UTC, March 27, 2004. From these two true-color images, it is difficult to detect SDS from other phenomena such as clouds, haze, and surface features. It is also difficult to clearly identify SDS boundaries.

The cloud and dust storm can be easily identified for cloud NDDI \$<\$ 0.0 and for dust storm NDDI \$>\$ 0.28 .View All a Aqua MODIS true-color image 05:15 UTC, March 27, 2004 shows major dust storm moved into the Inner Mongolian regions. b Aqua MODIS NDDI image shows the clouds and dust storms after Terra MODIS passed over this region around 1 h and 35 min later .View AllNDDI is computed with the SRB reflectance measurements at TOA from both Terra and Aqua MODIS. Figs. 3 b and 4 b show the NDDI images corresponding to Figs. 3 a and 4 a . The SDS horizontal transport with the weather system can be detected clearly, and the clouds and SDS can be separated easily from NDDI images. The deep blue regions NDDI \$<\$ 0.0 show the clouds, while the red regions NDDI \$>\$ 0.28 show the SDS. Therefore, clouds and SDS can be separated easily using the simple index NDDI. Moreover, with two daytime overpasses of MODIS Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS each day, it is feasible to analyze the transport of SDSs. When we tracked the SDS transport between Terra and Aqua NDDI images, we found this SDS not only moved to the southeast direction with the weather system but also was swept into this system. The blue dot in the white circle moved about 2° longitude along the northeast direction from 110° in Fig. 3 b to 112° in Fig. 4 b .We have demonstrated our approach to monitor SDS with a new index called NDDI. By using this index, airborne dust can be discriminated from other features. This study indicates that NDDI is a promising index to effectively separate SDS from water/ice clouds and ground features except ground sand and dust. The BT of MODIS band 31 is used to separate airborne SDS with ground sand and dust. The NDDI has been tested over African regions [14] . We found that the NDDI is working with different threshold values there. Further studies will be conducted in the near future, which may include validating the NDDI for SDS detection over different regions, identifying the NDDI threshold values in different regions, and developing multithreshold approaches to detect SDS by combining MODIS SRB and thermal emissive band measurements."
412,ocean,"Assessment of MODIS-derived visible and near-IR aerosol optical properties and their spatial variability in the presence of mineral dust. Mineral dust aerosol is among the most difficult aerosol species to measure quantitatively from space. In this paper, we evaluate MODIS retrievals of spectral aerosol optical depth AOD from the visible to the near- IR off the US West Coast using measurements taken by the NASA Ames Airborne Tracking Sunphotometer, AATS- 14, during the EVE Extended- MODIS-lambda Validation Experiment, 2004 campaign in April of 2004. In EVE, a total of 35 and 49 coincident over- ocean suborbital measurements at the nominal level- 2 retrieval scale of 10 km x 10 km were collected for Terra and Aqua, respectively. For MODIS- Terra about 80% of the AOD retrievals are within the estimated uncertainty, Delta tau = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau; this is true for both the visible here defined to include 466 - 855 nm and near- IR here defined to include 1243 - 2119 nm retrievals. For MODIS- Aqua about 45% of the AOD retrievals are within Delta tau = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau; the fraction of near- IR retrievals that fall within this uncertainty range is about 27%. We found an rms difference of 0.71 between the sunphotometer and MODIS- Aqua estimates of the visible 553 - 855 nm angstrom ngstrom exponent, while the MODIS- Terra visible A ngstrom exponents show an rms difference of only 0.29 when compared to AATS. The cause of the differences in performance between MODIS- Terra and MODIS- Aqua could be instrument calibration and needs to be explored further. The spatial variability of AOD between retrieval boxes as derived by MODIS is generally larger than that indicated by the sunphotometer data. , yet it is among the most difficult aerosol species to measure quantitatively from space. The observational challenges stem from the lack of knowledge on dust particle shape and absorption, and from the spatial inhomogeneity of dust plumes, which makes it difficult for certain cloud masking techniques to distinguish them from cirrus clouds. Several field campaigns in recent years have been partially devoted to evaluating satellite retrievals of mineral dust properties. The timing and location of the EVE Extended-MODIS- found no significant difference between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua in their ability to determine AOD between 466 and 855 nm. AATS-14 measures direct solar beam transmission in narrow channels with bandwidths between 2 and 5.6 nm for the wavelengths between 354 and 1558 nm and 17.3 nm for the 2139 nm channel by using detectors in a tracking head that is mounted externally to the aircraft. From the measured slant-path transmissions we derive the aerosol optical depth AOD , All suborbital measurements considered in this paper were taken within ±30 minutes of satellite overpass time at aircraft altitudes below 80 m usually at altitudes of 30–40 m . Within each grid box, the AATS-14 measurements of AOD were averaged to yield a spectrum, which was then fitted with a quadratic least-square fit of log  Based on coincident measurements with the NASA AATS-14, we have evaluated i MODIS retrievals of spectral AOD from the visible to the near-IR, ii MODIS retrievals of the visible 553–855 nm and near-IR 855–2119 nm Ångstrom exponents, iii changes in AOD and Ångstrom exponents between adjacent MODIS retrieval boxes. The timing and location of these measurements were chosen to maximize the likelihood of encountering Asian dust transported across the Pacific Ocean, providing a measurable AOD at wavelengths beyond 855 nm. Our assessment of the presence of mineral dust is supported by NAAPS NRL Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System model results and by the in situ instrumentation on the aircraft a 3- [2005], who found a correlation in differences between MODIS and suborbital AOD measurements with MODIS-derived cloud fraction. A more careful assessment of this effect on the basis of airborne sunphotometer data in multiple field campaigns in the vicinity of clouds is forthcoming, but beyond the scope of this paper."
409,dust,"Detection of Asia dust storms using multisensor satellite measurements. Observations from visible, infrared and microwave satellite instruments are integrated to detect dust storm over northwestern China. Microwave measurements are used to detect the dust storm underneath ice clouds, while visible and infrared measurements are utilized for delineating the cloud-free dust systems. Detection is based on microwave polarized brightness temperature differences ΔTb = Tbv − Tbh among two channels of 89 GHz and 23.8 GHz and infrared brightness temperature difference BTD between channels at 11 and 12 μm. It is shown that the integrated approach is better than the method solely based on infrared BTD in storm detection, especially for those dust systems covered by ice clouds. This approach is applied for the Asia dust storms cases using the data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer AMSR-E onboard Aqua satellite.  react-text: 1197 Mineral dust plays an important role from a climate study point of view, as do anthropogenic aerosols, especially when we consider the global trend of desertification caused by land development /react-text Sokolik & Toon, 1996; Tegen & Lacis, 1996 react-text: 1199 .

Because the visible–infrared radiance is primarily sensitive to the upper cirrus cloud layer, especially when the upper-layer cirri are thick, the BTD approach is nearly useless to detect dust under cirrus areas. The microwave radiation, however, is not significantly scattered or absorbed by ice clouds. Microwave can penetrate the ice cloud, so the change of microwave radiation caused by the dust below the cirrus can be received by the microwave sensors on satellite and finally converted to the change of brightness temperature.

For the period of 2003 to 2004, we have identified and collected six dust storm cases see /react-text Table 1 react-text: 1255 over northwest China. /react-text Fig. 1 react-text: 1270 . /react-text react-text: 1271 Example of six dust outbreaks of the true color composite over northwest China, in which channels 0.65 μm, 0.56 μm and 0.47 μm are associated with red, green and blue colors, respectively. Box 1 is the pure dust region DUST , box 2 the clouds over dust region COD , and box 3 the cloud in dust-free cloud region CLD . The regions covered by green, black, red curves are the dust areas that were decided by BTD, surface meteorological stations and multisensors method, respectively. /react-text Table 1 react-text: 1277 . /react-text react-text: 1278 Six dust cases used in this study /react-text react-text: 1339 Since channels at 11 and 12 μm lie in the thermal–IR window, absorption by other atmospheric gases is negligibly small and dust has a higher emissivity at 12 μm than at 11 μm, the BTD between the 11 and 12 μm channels BT /react-text 45 react-text: 1341 can be used to detect the dust storm. /react-text Ackerman 1997 react-text: 1343 showed that the BT /react-text 45 react-text: 1345 for dust is negative because dust has a higher albedo at 12 μm than at 11 μm. In this case, the clouds are distinct from the dust in the BT /react-text 45 react-text: 1347 image /react-text Fig. 2 react-text: 1349 . The average BT /react-text 45 react-text: 1351 is less than − /react-text react-text: 1352   /react-text react-text: 1353 2.0 K in the pure dust region and larger than 0 K in the cloudy regions. Using a threshold of BTD /react-text react-text: 1354   /react-text react-text: 1355 = /react-text react-text: 1356   /react-text react-text: 1357 − /react-text react-text: 1358   /react-text react-text: 1359 2 K would identify 80% of the dust. However, it can only identify 5% of pixels in the cloud over the dust region. It is because the infrared radiance is primarily sensitive to the upper cloud layer. If the threshold of − /react-text react-text: 1360   /react-text react-text: 1361 1.0 K is used for the BT /react-text 45 react-text: 1363 , 98% of the dust can be identified and 15% of the cloud over dust can be discriminated. But in dusty areas with clouds, the BT /react-text 45 react-text: 1365 signals tend to cancel each other and many pixel values of the BT /react-text 45 react-text: 1367 in COD region are within the observed probability distribution for CLD. Thus, the discrimination cannot be possible for the dust under clouds because the BTD histograms of CLD and COD are close with peaks at 0.7 and 0.1 K, respectively. The BT /react-text 45 react-text: 1369 can also be used as an additional constraint for detecting fire and smoke, but the threshold is BT /react-text 45 react-text: 1371   /react-text react-text: 1372 > /react-text react-text: 1373   /react-text react-text: 1374 4.0 K /react-text Li et al., 2003 react-text: 1376 . /react-text Fig. 2 react-text: 1391 . /react-text react-text: 1392 Comparison of the brightness temperature difference BTD between 11 and 12 μm for six cases for the three regions.

The red color is the pure dust region DUST , and green the clouds over dust region COD . /react-text Fig. 3 react-text: 1396 compares the Δ /react-text b react-text: 1453 for CLD region is much smaller than that for the COD region. This suggests that the difference Δ /react-text T b react-text: 1456 between lower frequency 23.8 GHz and higher frequency 89 GHz can be used to detect COD regions. /react-text Fig. 4 react-text: 1458 shows scatter plots of Δ /react-text T b89 react-text: 1461 with Δ /react-text T b23.8 react-text: 1464 for each of the three groups for six cases listed in /react-text Table 1 react-text: 1466 . Δ /react-text T b89 react-text: 1469 and Δ /react-text T b23.8 react-text: 1472 are the difference Δ /react-text T b react-text: 1475   /react-text react-text: 1476 = /react-text react-text: 1477   /react-text T bv react-text: 1480   /react-text react-text: 1481 − /react-text react-text: 1482   /react-text T bh react-text: 1485 between the vertical and horizontal components of the brightness temperature at 89 GHz and 23.8 GHz, respectively. The relationships between Δ /react-text T b89 react-text: 1488 and Δ /react-text T b23.8 react-text: 1491 are distinct for dust-free and dust groups. For CLD groups in /react-text Fig. 4 react-text: 1493 , Δ /react-text T b react-text: 1496 is small at both 89 and 23.8 frequencies and ranges from 0 to 15 K, and the mean value of Δ /react-text T b89 react-text: 1499 and Δ /react-text T b23.8 react-text: 1502 is 4.75 K and 6.05 K, respectively see /react-text Table 2 react-text: 1504 . The standard deviation of Δ /react-text T b89 react-text: 1507 3.01 K and Δ /react-text T b23.8 react-text: 1510 4.18 K is also very close. In contrast, both Δ /react-text T b89 react-text: 1513 and Δ /react-text T b23.8 react-text: 1516 are much larger for COD and DUST groups. For COD groups, mean Δ /react-text T b89 react-text: 1519 is 12.48 K, which is about 10.49 K less than the mean value of Δ /react-text T b23.8 react-text: 1522 , and their standard deviations, which are 3.85 K and 6.70 K, respectively, are also quite different. In addition to the presence of clouds, this large difference arises from the fact that the MW radiation emanates from much lower dust layers than the top ice cloud radiances. For the dust group, the mean Δ /react-text T b89 react-text: 1525 20.75 K is about 8.07 K less than the average Δ /react-text T b23.8 react-text: 1528 values 28.82 K , which is close to the COD group and much larger than the CLD group, their standard deviations are 6.63 K and 6.92 K, respectively. These results suggest that significant differences between Δ /react-text T b89 react-text: 1531 and Δ /react-text T b23.8 react-text: 1534 can be used as a discriminator of identifying dust storm. We define a microwave polarized index MPI for monitoring the dust storm. The MPI can be written as: /react-text 1 MPI = Δ ⁡ T b 89 − Δ ⁡ T b 23.8 <math class=""math""><mi is=""true"">MPI</mi><mo is=""true"">=</mo><mi mathvariant=""normal"" is=""true"">Δ</mi><mo is=""true"">⁡</mo><msub is=""true""><mi is=""true"">T</mi><mrow is=""true""><mtext is=""true"">b</mtext><mn is=""true"">89</mn></mrow></msub><mo is=""true"">−</mo><mi mathvariant=""normal"" is=""true"">Δ</mi><mo is=""true"">⁡</mo><msub is=""true""><mi is=""true"">T</mi><mrow is=""true""><mtext is=""true"">b</mtext><mn is=""true"">23.8</mn></mrow></msub></math>Fig. 4 react-text: 1570 . /react-text react-text: 1571 Comparison of the microwave brightness temperature difference in K between /react-text T b89v react-text: 1574   /react-text react-text: 1575 − /react-text react-text: 1576   /react-text T b89h react-text: 1579 and /react-text T b23.8v react-text: 1582   /react-text react-text: 1583 − /react-text react-text: 1584   /react-text T b23.8h react-text: 1587 for six cases for the three regions. The blue color represents the cloud in the dust-free cloud region CLD , the green the clouds over dust region COD , and red the pure dust region DUST . /react-text Table 2 react-text: 1593 . /react-text react-text: 1594 The mean and standard deviation of the difference between vertical and horizontal components of the brightness temperature at 89 GHz and 23.8 GHz for the three regions /react-text Fig. 5 react-text: 1636 shows the MPI histogram for dust region red bar , COD region green bar and CLD region blue bar which is derived from the six cases listed in /react-text Table 1 react-text: 1638 . The major difference between the COD and CLD is the frequency distribution of MPI. /react-text Fig. 5 react-text: 1640 displays that better discrimination is possible for the dust under ice cloud because the MPI histograms of CLD and COD are substantially different with peaks at − /react-text react-text: 1641   /react-text react-text: 1642 1.3 and − /react-text react-text: 1643   /react-text react-text: 1644 10.5 K, respectively. However, the COD and DUST regions yield about 100% negatively large MPI values and their MPI histograms are relatively similar with peaks at − /react-text react-text: 1645   /react-text react-text: 1646 10.5 and − /react-text react-text: 1647   /react-text react-text: 1648 8.5 K, respectively. Using a threshold of MPI of − /react-text react-text: 1649   /react-text react-text: 1650 7.0 K, we would identify about 85% of the cloud over dust and pure dust pixels. In this case, values of MPI less than − /react-text react-text: 1651   /react-text react-text: 1652 7.0 K should indicate the presence of dust under ice cloud. However, it would misidentify 5% of the dust-free clouds having relatively small MPI < /react-text react-text: 1653   /react-text react-text: 1654 − /react-text react-text: 1655   /react-text react-text: 1656 7.0 K . The second peak of COD may be related to areas where the dust intensities are weaker than those in pure dust regions. /react-text Fig. 5 react-text: 1671 . /react-text react-text: 1672 Histogram of the microwave polarized brightness temperature difference index i.e., MPI /react-text react-text: 1673   /react-text react-text: 1674 = /react-text react-text: 1675   /react-text react-text: 1676 /react-text T b89v react-text: 1679   /react-text react-text: 1680 − /react-text react-text: 1681   /react-text T b89h react-text: 1684 /react-text react-text: 1685   /react-text react-text: 1686 − /react-text react-text: 1687   /react-text react-text: 1688 /react-text T b23.8v react-text: 1691   /react-text react-text: 1692 − /react-text react-text: 1693   /react-text T b23.8h react-text: 1696 for six cases for the three regions. The blue color represents the cloud in dust-free cloud region CLD . The red color is the pure dust region DUST , and green the clouds over dust region COD . /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 1700 compares the distribution of MPI left panel and BTD right panel for the dust storm case of March 27, 2003. The coverage of red solid line is the true dust storm region determined by surface meteorological stations' observation. It can be easily seen from /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 1702 that some cloud covered regions identified by BTD are re-identified as COD by the MPI method, and the dust storm region detected by MPI is much closer to the true dust storm region than it was identified by the BTD method. It is concluded that that discriminating dust from clouds may be possible by satellite microwave measurements. This can be achieved by only IR measurements. The combined multisensor measurements can be used to improve the determination of dust storm coverage, especially for detecting the COD region. /react-text Fig. 7 react-text: 1704 shows the flow chart of our multisensors approach for detecting dust storms. As it shows, the visible channel is first used to separate the target region into cloud and cloud-free regions. Then BTD method will be used to check the cloud-free region for identifying whether there exists a dust area or not. If the cloud region is surrounded by dust aerosols, the MPI method will be used to detect the dust underneath the clouds. The final dust regions, therefore, are determined by both the BTD and MPI methods. The comparison of multisensor methods with the BTD method is shown in /react-text Fig. 1 react-text: 1706 . It is obvious that the dust storm coverage which is determined by the multisensor method red curve is much closer to the true dust storm region black curve than that identified by the BTD method green curve . /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 1721 . /react-text react-text: 1722 Comparison of dust storm area identified by the MPI a and BTD b for the dust storm case 5 March 27, 2004 .

Microwave radiation, however, can penetrate ice and is well suitable for monitoring dust storms when there exists an ice cloud. The method of using microwave to detect dust is based on the polarization difference technique which can partially overcome surface emissivity variability and distinguish dust from cloud. The results found here indicate that using MPI may provide accuracies of ∼ /react-text react-text: 1746   /react-text react-text: 1747 90% for detecting COD systems. Detection of COD with larger MPI or with better accuracy requires much additional studies. The new techniques were applied to the AMSR-E observations over northwest China. Although the techniques described in this paper exploit the AMSR-E observations, they could be easily adapted for other microwave sensor applications such as SSM/I and AMSU observations. By combining both the methods, it could be possible to overcome some of the weaknesses in the two techniques used alone. For example, the MPI data provide minimal discrimination for cloud over dust identified as ice cloud, but the BTD can be used to detect many of the pure dust regions. Conversely, the MPI is not particularly helpful in the identification of weak dust storms, but BTD appears to be useful in these cases. This approach has also a potential to discriminate dust from smoke. When dust and smoke are mixed together, the BT /react-text 45 react-text: 1749 should be much higher than the smoke-free dust event and the BTD approach cannot discriminate the dust from the smoke. The microwave radiation, however, is not significantly scattered or absorbed by smoke. Microwave polarized brightness temperature difference can be used to detect the dust in this case. /react-text "
406,dust,"Identification and physical retrieval of dust storm using three MODIS thermal IR channels. In this paper, the dust event on 7 April 2001 in northern China is investigated with three MODIS thermal infrared IR bands. It is found that for the dust cloud, the observed 11 μm minus 12 μm brightness temperature difference BTD is always negative, while the BTD of 8.5 μm minus 11 μm varies from positive to negative depending on the dust concentration. Based on these distinguishing properties, we develop a dust mask algorithm to identify the dust storm occurrence and spatial extent. The algorithm can be used successfully in both the daytime and nighttime. Using the Mie spherical scattering theory, the thermal radiation transfer through the single dust layer is performed with the widely used forward model DISTORT. Our calculations show that the dust-like aerosols can well explain the observed BTD although both of the complex refractive index and particle size of aerosols will significantly influence the BTD. When the complex refractive index is fixed dust-like aerosols in this paper , then the dust optical thickness and effective radii of dust particles can be retrieved from the brightness temperature BT of the 11 μm channel and the BTD of 11 μm minus 12 μm channels, respectively. The integral dust column density can also be derived from the retrieved dust optical thickness and effective radius.  react-text: 791 Dust storms often occur in the spring season and influence large areas of northern China. During a dust-storm event, the concentration of dust particles in the atmosphere increases significantly. The increased dust concentration produces air quality hazards along the transportation routes. Dust storms may also have climatic influences on regional and global scales through their interactions with the solar and terrestrial radiative fields /react-text Shi and Zhao, 2003 react-text: 793 . /react-text react-text: 795 Satellite monitoring is a powerful tool for studying the properties of large-scale dust storms. Since the 1970s, scientists have succeeded in identifying the outbreaks of dust storms from satellite images by use of two different techniques, the VIR visible and near-infrared technique /react-text Griggs, 1975; Carlson, 1979; Norton et al., 1980 react-text: 797 and the TIR thermal infrared window technique /react-text Shenk and Curran, 1974; Ackerman, 1989 react-text: 799 . It has been shown that the TIR technique has the distinct advantage in detecting dust storms over high-albedo surfaces and in nighttimes. /react-text react-text: 801 Based on the identification techniques, more recent studies have been carried out to quantitatively determine the physical parameters of dust storms, such as aerosol loading. The aerosol loading is a key parameter for dust-storm assessment, modeling, and forecasting. The VIR technique can be used to retrieve this parameter over ocean /react-text Tanré et al., 1997 react-text: 803 ; but to do so over land remains a major challenge. Because dust storms mostly occur over desert or arid regions with bright surfaces, such as the Sahara Desert and the Gobi Desert, the surface contribution to the satellite signal is quite large and often unknown. As a result, estimates of the properties of dust aerosol are highly uncertain. /react-text Wen and Rose 1994 react-text: 806 developed an algorithm based on the TIR technique for the retrieval of particle size, optical thickness and total mass of volcanic cloud by using the AVHRR bands 4 and 5. The concept of their algorithm is similar to that for the retrieval of cirrus using the BTD method /react-text Wu, 1987; Giraud et al., 1997 react-text: 808 . The principle is applicable to remote sense the properties of the dust storm. In addition, /react-text Ackerman 1997 react-text: 810 investigated the possibility of detecting volcanic and soil-derived aerosols using infrared observations at wavelengths 8.5 /react-text react-text: 811   /react-text react-text: 812 μm together with 11 and 12 /react-text react-text: 813   /react-text react-text: 814 μm from theoretical calculations. /react-text react-text: 816 In this paper, we develop a dust-storm mask algorithm for identifying the dust-storm outbreak and the spatial extent using the three TIR window channels, as proposed by /react-text Ackerman 1997 react-text: 818 . Because only TIR channels are used, the algorithm is applicable to both daytime and nighttime conditions. Further, if adequate aerosol physical information complex refractive index and particle size distribution are determined, satellite observations of the three channels can be explained with the forward model's simulation. The BT of the 11 /react-text react-text: 819   /react-text react-text: 820 μm channel shows a quasi-linear relationship with dust optical thickness and the BTD between the 11 and 12 /react-text react-text: 821   /react-text react-text: 822 μm channels shows a quasi-linear relationship with particle size. Depending on this physical understanding and a pre-calculated look-up table, an algorithm is also proposed for the retrieval of dust-cloud optical thickness and dust-particle effective radius. The algorithm is applied to studying the severe dust storm that occurred on 7 April 2001 over northern China. Based on the retrieved dust optical thickness and dust-particle effective radius, integral dust columnar density is derived. /react-text react-text: 829 In spring, the northern part of China is dry and often windy, providing the favorable conditions for the development of dust storms. From March to May 2001, 18 strong dust events were observed /react-text Wu et al., 2004 react-text: 831 in China. Analyses from the view point of synoptic meteorology show that synoptic scale dust storms are related to cold front and cyclone activities, while meso-scale dust storms are often related to squall lines and secondary cold fronts. Strong pressure gradient and well-developed baroclinicity can be found in these weather conditions, which cause strong near-surface wind, lifting sand and dust particles to high levels and carrying them to long distances. /react-text react-text: 834 Among the above-mentioned weather systems, Mongolia cyclone usually generates the most severe dust storms. From 15 March to 30 April 2001, there are 13 such cases /react-text Wu et al., 2004 react-text: 836 , with the strongest one occurring on April 6 and 7. The 6–7 April dust storm first developed over Mongolia, then spread to Inner Mongolia and finally swept across northern China. According to synoptic records, the visibility in Erlianhaote City Inner Mongolia was less than 50 /react-text react-text: 837   /react-text react-text: 838 m, and the maximum instantaneous wind speed reached 30 /react-text react-text: 839   /react-text react-text: 840 m /react-text react-text: 841   /react-text react-text: 842 s /react-text react-text: 844 − /react-text react-text: 845   /react-text react-text: 846 1 /react-text react-text: 847 . From 16:00 6 April to 02:00 7 April Beijing standard time , the dust storm was the most intensive. The visibility decreased to 0 according to the records of five meteorological stations in the middle of Inner Mongolia. The dust storm evolved to a black storm. According to the NOAA website /react-text http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s624.htm react-text: 849 , this dust storm reached North America two weeks later, blanketing a layer of fine particles from Canada to Arizona. /react-text Fig. 1 react-text: 851 shows the satellite RGB composition image from MODIS channels 1 645 /react-text react-text: 852   /react-text react-text: 853 nm , 4 555 /react-text react-text: 854   /react-text react-text: 855 nm and 3 469 /react-text react-text: 856   /react-text react-text: 857 nm for this dust storm on 7 April. From the image, it can be seen clearly that most of northern China was covered by this severe dust storm. /react-text Fig. 1 react-text: 868 . /react-text react-text: 869 The 6–7 April 2001 severe dust storm, as shown by RGB composition image from MODIS channel 1 645 /react-text react-text: 870   /react-text react-text: 871 nm , 4 555 /react-text react-text: 872   /react-text react-text: 873 nm and 3 469 /react-text react-text: 874   /react-text react-text: 875 nm . From the image, it can be seen that most of northern China was covered by this dust storm. It also reveals that the strength of dust storm is heterogeneous in space. Six squares with different colors show the data sample regions in this paper. /react-text react-text: 882 In this study, the MODIS observation of the dust storm on 7 April is selected as the case for developing the identification algorithm. MODIS is the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer on board of the Terra satellite which was launched in December 1999. It has 36 spectral channels including the 8.5 channel 29 , 11 channel 31 , 12 /react-text react-text: 883   /react-text react-text: 884 μm channel 32 TIR channels, which have been fully tested with the forward radiative transfer calculations for monitoring dust storm by /react-text Ackerman 1997 react-text: 886 . /react-text react-text: 889 From the MODIS RGB true color composition image /react-text Fig. 1 react-text: 891 , we can distinguish clearly that more than half of the monitoring area is filled by yellow dust aerosol. It also reveals that the strength of dust storm is spatially heterogeneous.

From the BTD–BT scattering plot in /react-text Fig. 2 react-text: 988 , the satellite data we sampled from different area corresponding to the different aerosol loading generally can distinguish from each other very well. It indicates not only the outbreak and extent of coverage region of dust storm can be identified but also the strength of dust storm can be inferred possibly. /react-text react-text: 991 The typical values of BTD /react-text react-text: 993 11 /react-text react-text: 994   /react-text react-text: 995 − /react-text react-text: 996   /react-text react-text: 997 12 /react-text react-text: 998 for the observed targets by satellite are listed in /react-text Table 1 react-text: 1000 . As it indicates, BTD /react-text react-text: 1002 11 /react-text react-text: 1003   /react-text react-text: 1004 − /react-text react-text: 1005   /react-text react-text: 1006 12 /react-text react-text: 1007 is the optimal threshold to identify the dust storm from other targets. /react-text Table 1 react-text: 1013 . /react-text react-text: 1014 Typical value of observed targets by satellite /react-text react-text: 1045 Generally speaking, BT /react-text 11 react-text: 1047 represents the equivalent dust cloud top temperature. The lower BT /react-text 11 react-text: 1049 , the higher altitude the dust cloud can be reached. Therefore, we expect that low BT /react-text 11 react-text: 1051 corresponds to heavy dust aerosol loading. However, BT /react-text 11 react-text: 1053 alone is not sufficient to determine the strength of dust storm because of its strong dependence on surface temperature. The low surface temperature in background will also give the low BT /react-text 11 react-text: 1055 in the satellite observations. As showed in /react-text Fig. 2 react-text: 1057 b, BTD /react-text react-text: 1059 8 /react-text react-text: 1060   /react-text react-text: 1061 − /react-text react-text: 1062   /react-text react-text: 1063 11 /react-text react-text: 1064 has a good linear relationship with BT /react-text 11 react-text: 1066 . With the decrement of BT /react-text 11 react-text: 1068 , BTD /react-text react-text: 1070 8 /react-text react-text: 1071   /react-text react-text: 1072 − /react-text react-text: 1073   /react-text react-text: 1074 11 /react-text react-text: 1075 varies from negative to positive. Moreover, BTD /react-text react-text: 1077 8 /react-text react-text: 1078   /react-text react-text: 1079 − /react-text react-text: 1080   /react-text react-text: 1081 11 /react-text react-text: 1082 is hardly influenced by surface temperature. Therefore, BTD /react-text react-text: 1084 8 /react-text react-text: 1085   /react-text react-text: 1086 − /react-text react-text: 1087   /react-text react-text: 1088 11 /react-text react-text: 1089 is the optimal threshold to determine the strength of dust storm. /react-text react-text: 1092 By combination of BTD /react-text react-text: 1094 11 /react-text react-text: 1095   /react-text react-text: 1096 − /react-text react-text: 1097   /react-text react-text: 1098 12 /react-text react-text: 1099 and BTD /react-text react-text: 1101 8 /react-text react-text: 1102   /react-text react-text: 1103 − /react-text react-text: 1104   /react-text react-text: 1105 11 /react-text react-text: 1106 , we develop a dust-storm mask algorithm. This algorithm can automatically identify the outbreak and the relative strength of dust storm from MODIS observations. The thresholds of BTD /react-text react-text: 1108 11 /react-text react-text: 1109   /react-text react-text: 1110 − /react-text react-text: 1111   /react-text react-text: 1112 12 /react-text react-text: 1113 and BTD /react-text react-text: 1115 8 /react-text react-text: 1116   /react-text react-text: 1117 − /react-text react-text: 1118   /react-text react-text: 1119 11 /react-text react-text: 1120 are listed in /react-text Table 2 react-text: 1122 . Because of the spectral variation of surface emissivity, the surface usually contributes about − /react-text react-text: 1123   /react-text react-text: 1124 0.5 /react-text react-text: 1125   /react-text react-text: 1126 K in BTD /react-text react-text: 1128 11 /react-text react-text: 1129   /react-text react-text: 1130 − /react-text react-text: 1131   /react-text react-text: 1132 12 /react-text react-text: 1133 . Therefore, the threshold of BTD /react-text react-text: 1135 11 /react-text react-text: 1136   /react-text react-text: 1137 − /react-text react-text: 1138   /react-text react-text: 1139 12 /react-text react-text: 1140 was set as − /react-text react-text: 1141   /react-text react-text: 1142 0.5. As discussed before, there is a substantial advantage to use BTD as a criterion to identify dust storms because BTD is less dependent on the surface temperature than BT. Results obtained by applying the dust-storm mask algorithm to the 7 April 2001 are shown in /react-text Fig. 3 react-text: 1144 a /react-text react-text: 1145 . For comparison, the BTD /react-text react-text: 1147 11 /react-text react-text: 1148   /react-text react-text: 1149 − /react-text react-text: 1150   /react-text react-text: 1151 12 /react-text react-text: 1152 image is shown in /react-text Fig. 3 react-text: 1154 b. /react-text Table 2 react-text: 1160 . /react-text react-text: 1161 Thresholds for the identification algorithm for dust storm /react-text Fig. 3 react-text: 1287 . /react-text react-text: 1288 Dust-storm mask results and original MODIS BTD /react-text 11–12 react-text: 1290 image.

Three main physical parameters are necessary to describe the aerosol model, namely, the complex refractive index, particle size distribution and particle shape. /react-text The complex refractive index is the parameter to describe the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter. It comprises a real part and an imaginary part. The real part indicates the scattering properties and the imaginary part indicates the absorption properties of dust aerosol. This index depends on dust aerosol chemical composition. Very little has been done in measuring the refractive index of dust aerosols, especially in the thermal infrared region. Therefore, there is limited data available for the purpose of this study. Further, the chemical composition of dust aerosols changes greatly in space and in time depending on their origin. Therefore, the complex refractive index is the main uncertain in the forward simulation. This uncertainty will be further discussed later. react-text: 1316 Dust particles suspended in air have a wide range of sizes which may vary from 0.001 to 1000 /react-text react-text: 1317   /react-text react-text: 1318 μm. Dust particle size distributions are often expressed in the form of power exponential or lognormal distribution. The former is usually better when the aerosol size is small, but becomes worse when the aerosol size is large. During dust storms, large particles become dominant and, therefore, the lognormal distribution LND is selected here: /react-text 1 n r = N 0 2 ⁢ π 1 r ⁢ ln ⁢ σ exp [ ln ⁢ r − ln r 0 2 2 ln ⁢ σ 2 ] <math class=""math""><mi is=""true"">n</mi><mo is=""true""> </mo><mi is=""true"">r</mi><mo is=""true""> </mo><mo is=""true"">=</mo><mfrac is=""true""><mrow is=""true""><msub is=""true""><mi is=""true"">N</mi><mn is=""true"">0</mn></msub></mrow><msqrt is=""true""><mrow is=""true""><mn is=""true"">2</mn><mo is=""true"">⁢</mo><mi is=""true"">π</mi></mrow></msqrt></mfrac><mfrac is=""true""><mn is=""true"">1</mn><mrow is=""true""><mi is=""true"">r</mi><mo is=""true"">⁢</mo><mi is=""true"">ln</mi><mo is=""true"">⁢</mo><mi is=""true"">σ</mi></mrow></mfrac><mi is=""true"">exp</mi><mrow is=""true""><mo stretchy=""true"" is=""true"">[</mo><mfrac is=""true""><mrow is=""true""><msup is=""true""><mrow is=""true""><mo is=""true""> </mo><mi is=""true"">ln</mi><mo is=""true"">⁢</mo><mi is=""true"">r</mi><mo is=""true"">−</mo><mi is=""true"">ln</mi><msub is=""true""><mi is=""true"">r</mi><mn is=""true"">0</mn></msub><mo is=""true""> </mo></mrow><mn is=""true"">2</mn></msup></mrow><mrow is=""true""><mn is=""true"">2</mn><msup is=""true""><mrow is=""true""><mo is=""true""> </mo><mi is=""true"">ln</mi><mo is=""true"">⁢</mo><mi is=""true"">σ</mi><mo is=""true""> </mo></mrow><mn is=""true"">2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo stretchy=""true"" is=""true"">]</mo></mrow></math> react-text: 1375 where /react-text 0 react-text: 1465 , asymmetry factor, /react-text s react-text: 1978 , effective top temperature of dust layer, /react-text T c react-text: 1981 , dust aerosol loading, particle size distribution of dust aerosol and the refractive index of dust aerosol. When /react-text T s react-text: 1984 , /react-text T c react-text: 1987 and refractive index are fixed, BT /react-text 11 react-text: 1989 presents an almost linear relationship with dust optical thickness and BTD /react-text react-text: 1991 11 /react-text react-text: 1992   /react-text react-text: 1993 − /react-text react-text: 1994   /react-text react-text: 1995 12 /react-text react-text: 1996 presents an almost linear relationship with dust particle size. Depending on this physical pattern, the optical thickness and particle effective radii of dust particles can be retrieved simultaneously. The methodology of the fitting and retrieval process by numerical iteration is illustrated by /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 1998 . The kernel of the process is a pre-calculated look-up table LUT .

Therefore, the accuracy of /react-text T s react-text: 2065 and /react-text T c react-text: 2068 will determine how reliable the retrieved results are. In the current retrieval algorithm, /react-text T c react-text: 2071 was taken from BT /react-text 11 react-text: 2073 approximately and /react-text T s react-text: 2076 was taken from a background BT /react-text 11 react-text: 2078 minus 5 /react-text react-text: 2079   /react-text react-text: 2080 K.

It is well known that the convergence of Mongolia cyclone locates in the low altitude and the divergence in the high altitude. In the convergent area, dust is just brought into the air from the surface. Therefore, large particles dominate this area red area in /react-text Fig. 7 react-text: 2243 b . In the divergence area, more dust particles have been brought to the air could move into the higher level of atmosphere. As a result, both optical thickness and dust column density is larger in this area red area in /react-text Fig. 7 react-text: 2245 a while particle size could be smaller. Therefore, the pattern of retrieval image appears reasonable. However, the retrieval results require more robust validations with the in situ measurements. /react-text Fig. 7 react-text: 2256 . /react-text react-text: 2257 The retrieval results of dust storm on April 7, 2001: a, b, c retrieved dust optical thickness dimensionless , effective radius of dust particle μm and integral dust columnar density 10 /react-text 6 react-text: 2259   /react-text react-text: 2260 μg /react-text react-text: 2261   /react-text react-text: 2262 m /react-text react-text: 2264 − /react-text react-text: 2265   /react-text react-text: 2266 2 /react-text react-text: 2267 , respectively. /react-text react-text: 2274 The MODIS observations of the 7 April 2001 dust storm have been investigated in this paper. From the analysis of observation data, a dust-storm mask algorithm for the identification of dust storm outbreak and the spatial extent has been developed. The mask algorithm is based on the threshold BTD /react-text react-text: 2276 11 /react-text react-text: 2277   /react-text react-text: 2278 − /react-text react-text: 2279   /react-text react-text: 2280 12 /react-text react-text: 2281 and BTD /react-text react-text: 2283 8 /react-text react-text: 2284   /react-text react-text: 2285 − /react-text react-text: 2286   /react-text react-text: 2287 11 /react-text react-text: 2288 . It can be used in both daytime and nighttime conditions for automatic identifying of the dust storm. /react-text react-text: 2290 Under the assumptions that the underlying surface is homogeneous and the dust cloud is a single layer parallel to the surface, radiative transfer calculations has been performed to simulate the satellite observation.

Depending on this physical concept, a retrieval algorithm has been developed to obtain the optical thickness, dust particle effective radius and integral dust column density simultaneously.

The unknown surface emissivity also has considerable influence on the forward and retrieval process. These factors will decrease the reliability of retrieval results.

401,dust,"Desert dust observation from space – Application of measured mineral component infrared extinction spectra. Measured extinction spectra of six different components of desert dust have been used as input for a mineral dust retrieval algorithm for the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer IASI based on Singular Vector Decomposition. The use of measured dust component extinction spectra rather than dust sample-based optical properties widely used in thermal infrared applications improves retrieval results significantly. Correlation between IASI derived dust optical depth at 0.5 μm and AERONET sun-photometer observations from six months over Northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Asia improved from formerly 0.623 to now 0.757 while the root-mean-square difference decreased from 0.322 to now 0.174 and the bias decreased in terms of its absolute value from −0.181 to 0.003. The dynamically adjusted e−1 envelope of the deviation histogram between AERONET and IASI dust AOD at 0.5 μm is at 0.160 while 80% of all IASI observations are within AOD0.5 μm ± 0.2 of respective AERONET values. Spatial patterns of dust observations with the retrieval based on dust components compare very well with known features in terms of monthly mean gridded Aerosol Optical Depth. Although originally being developed for Northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and adjacent Oceans, the retrieval method performs equally well in Asian dust source regions and downwind areas. As a further strength it provides observations at day and night overpasses of the Metop spacecraft, thus twice daily.  react-text: 297 Desert dust aerosol is a key component in the climate system through different interaction mechanisms e.g. /react-text N’Tchayi Mbourou et al., 1997 react-text: 299 ; /react-text King et al., 1999 react-text: 301 ; /react-text Dunion and Velden, 2004 react-text: 303 ; /react-text Jickells et al., 2005 react-text: 305 ; /react-text Mahowald et al., 2005 react-text: 307 ; /react-text Klüser and Holzer-Popp, 2010 react-text: 309 ; /react-text Ravi et al., 2011 react-text: 311 . Its distribution is highly variable in space and time e.g. /react-text Engelstadter et al., 2006 react-text: 313 . Given the importance of knowledge about airborne dust in many fields, there is a long history in satellite remote sensing of dust aerosols, mainly from reflected solar radiation see e.g. /react-text King et al., 1999 react-text: 315 ; /react-text Kokhanovsky and de Leeuw, 2009 react-text: 317 . /react-text react-text: 319 The fourth assessment report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC showed that there are still large uncertainties in knowledge about both, direct and indirect effects of mineral dust aerosol on climate /react-text IPCC, 2007 react-text: 321 . /react-text Klüser and Holzer-Popp 2010 react-text: 324 have shown that for dust-cloud-interactions studies the time of observation can be a critical parameter. /react-text In the morning hours, when the convective state is still rather low over land regions with strong diurnal cycles of convection, satellite observations are insufficient to describe the impact of dust on convection. react-text: 327 Thus dust and cloud observations are needed near the maximum stage of the convective diurnal cycle. For morning overpass polar orbiting satellites like the Metop spacecraft, this can only be achieved with the respective night time overpasses, thus at times when no solar illumination is present and consequently aerosol retrievals at solar wavelengths do not work. Desert dust also can have significant impacts on regional air quality also far away from dust sources , including particulate matter, visibility and transport of bacteria, e.g. /react-text Prospero, 1999 react-text: 329 ; /react-text Qian et al., 2002 react-text: 331 . /react-text react-text: 333 Due to partly very strong resonance absorption peaks, mainly from Si–O, mineral dust can also be observed in the thermal infrared TIR region e.g. /react-text Shenk and Curran, 1974 react-text: 335 ; /react-text Ackerman, 1997 react-text: 337 ; /react-text Legrand et al., 2001 react-text: 339 . TIR sounders with their high spectral resolution are consequently especially well suited for dust remote sensing e.g. /react-text Pierangelo et al., 2004 react-text: 341 ; /react-text DeSouza-Machado et al., 2010 react-text: 343 ; /react-text Klüser et al., 2011 react-text: 345 . /react-text react-text: 347 In order to overcome the difficult need for a priori knowledge about atmospheric state and surface emissivity see /react-text Pierangelo et al., 2004 react-text: 349 ; /react-text DeSouza-Machado et al., 2010 react-text: 351 , Singular Vector Decomposition SVD of Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer IASI spectra was used for extracting the dust signal from TIR radiance spectra in /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 353 . SVD is a powerful statistical tool to also extract lower order variability information from non-symmetric data arrays /react-text Rodgers, 2000 react-text: 355 . /react-text react-text: 357 The paper is organized as follows: Section /react-text 2 react-text: 359 gives an overview of dust optical properties commonly used in TIR applications and a discussion on their limitations and future requirements. In section /react-text 3 react-text: 361 the SVD approach of /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 363 for dust remote sensing with IASI is briefly described together with changes of the dust extinction spectra used as retrieval inputs in order to account for variable mineralogical composition of the dust. Section /react-text 4 react-text: 365 presents results of this new algorithm version along with an evaluation against sun-photometer observations, followed by a discussion of the results in section /react-text 5 react-text: 367 and a concluding summary in section /react-text 6 react-text: 369 . /react-text In order to extract quantitative dust information from thermal infrared remote sensing the spectral characteristics of dust extinction mainly due to silicate absorptions have to be known or assumed.Brindley and Russell 2006 react-text: 378 compare the impact of the use of different dust models /react-text Hess et al., 1998 react-text: 380 ; /react-text Volz, 1973 react-text: 382 and /react-text Fouquart et al., 1987 react-text: 384 and find very large differences in respective dust retrieval results depending on the dust optical properties used. This result is also supported by /react-text Highwood et al. 2003 react-text: 386 , who report dust refractive indices being a much larger source of uncertainty then dust particle size distribution. /react-text Table 1 react-text: 390 lists a selection of publications dealing with quantitative TIR dust remote sensing from satellite and also ground-based observations together with the dust model optical properties database used for the respective application. Abbreviations of satellite instruments relate to the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder AIRS , the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer AVHRR the High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder HIRS , the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer IASI , the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer MODIS and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager SEVIRI . /react-text Table 1 react-text: 396 . /react-text react-text: 397 Examples of TIR remote sensing applications and dust optical properties used in the respective study. /react-text react-text: 487 From /react-text Table 1 react-text: 489 it is obvious that in a large fraction of TIR dust remote sensing applications optical properties of one of the four different dust models of OPAC Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds of /react-text Hess et al. 1998 react-text: 491 are used. Especially in the light of high resolution infrared sounders the rather coarse spectral resolution of OPAC, being developed for applications with broadband radiometers like AVHRR or MODIS, may introduce another source of error see also discussions in /react-text Brindley and Russell, 2006 react-text: 493 ; /react-text Klüser et al., 2011 react-text: 495 . The four dust types in OPAC as well as the dust optical properties of e.g. /react-text Volz, 1973 react-text: 497 and /react-text Fouquart et al., 1987 react-text: 499 are based on one set of refractive indices and calculated with different size distributions. Accordingly those optical properties databases are not able to account for variations in dust composition, which may impact on extinction spectra in TIR see e.g. /react-text Turner, 2008 react-text: 501 ; /react-text Hudson et al., 2008a,b react-text: 503 . /react-text react-text: 505 For example, /react-text Hudson et al. 2008a,b react-text: 507 and /react-text Mogili et al. 2008 react-text: 509 found strong differences in peak positions and spectral shape between Fourier-transform interferometer FTIR extinction measurements of typical mineral dust components and Mie calculations. /react-text react-text: 512 As extinction peak positions and slopes of different mineralogical components of desert dust vary over the TIR domain as can also be seen in /react-text Fig. 1 react-text: 514 and is discussed in Section /react-text 3 react-text: 516 , the mineralogy of the dust sample the optical properties are based on may also introduce uncertainties in retrieval results. /react-text Fig. 1 react-text: 531 . /react-text react-text: 532 Extinction spectra of the six mineral components as used in the improved IASI retrieval normalised by integrated spectral extinction for visualisation purpose . /react-text react-text: 539 The basic principle of /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 541 is to use a dust observation method for IASI which does not rely on a priori assumptions such as atmospheric state. This is especially critical as retrieval methods based on radiative transfer calculations require good knowledge about surface emissivity, which prevents most methods from being applied over land e.g. /react-text Pierangelo et al., 2004 react-text: 543 ; /react-text DeSouza-Machado et al., 2010 react-text: 545 . Despite this aim one a priori assumption could not be avoided in the /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 547 method – the use of a database of spectral dust optical properties. OPAC dust extinction spectra of four different size distributions are used in the method for dust retrieval. /react-text react-text: 549 Instead of using look-up tables generated by radiative transfer modelling, dust-related “equivalent optical depth” /react-text Klüser et al., 2011 react-text: 551 spectra have been determined in the 8–12 μm window region and then a singular vector decomposition is used for signal extraction. /react-text react-text: 553 For mathematical details of the retrieval method and its initial filtering steps the reader is kindly referred to /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 555 and only a short overview over the method is given here. /react-text react-text: 557 IASI spectra between 830 cm /react-text −1 react-text: 559 and 1250 cm /react-text −1 react-text: 561 are compiled into bins of 20 IASI channels 10 cm /react-text −1 react-text: 563  bin width each and only the maximum brightness temperature of each bin is used as spectral information, minimising the absorption effect of narrow gas absorption lines on the resulting spectra. Then the “equivalent optical depth” /react-text τ eqv <math class=""math""><mrow is=""true""><msub is=""true""><mi is=""true"">τ</mi><mrow is=""true""><mtext is=""true"">eqv</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></math> react-text: 570 is determined from observed radiance /react-text dust react-text: 716 of dust is lower than 20 K <10% for the allowed /react-text T dust react-text: 719 range . /react-text This section provides three examples of IASI dust observations with the improved method in three regions of the Northern hemisphere. react-text: 728 IASI observations of the evolution of a dust storm over Asia are presented in /react-text Fig. 2 react-text: 730 . The dust storm was initiated in the Western Taklimakan desert in the evening hours of April 16, 2009 behind a convective disturbance whitish background colours in /react-text Fig. 2 react-text: 732 indicate cold mean temperatures observed by the IASI integrated imaging subsystem IIS . On April 18 very high dust AOD is observed over the whole Taklimakan and is also transported Eastward behind the convective pattern. On April 19 the dust propagation towards Central China is clearly evident, while optical depth is still high, but not as dramatic as it was over the Taklimakan the day before. In addition, dust AOD over the Taklimakan desert is reduced. On April 20, 2009 the dust spreads over wide parts of Central China while over the Taklimakan another dust storm is initiated. /react-text Fig. 2 react-text: 747 . /react-text react-text: 748 AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 750 observations of the evolution of an Asian dust storm originating from the Taklimakan desert at April 16 top left , April 18 top right , April 19 bottom left and April 20 bottom right 2009. April 16 and April 19 observations are from ascending night time orbits while April 18 and April 20 are from descending orbits. /react-text Fig. 3 react-text: 754 highlights monthly mean dust optical depth for March and April 2009 gridded to 1° × 1° over Central and East Asia for descending local morning and ascending local evening orbits. The Taklimakan desert in Northern China can easily be identified as a regional dust hot spot in both months. During the Asian dust season in spring dust is transported from the Taklimakan and Gobi east of the Taklimakan source areas eastwards to Korea, Japan and the Pacific Ocean. In March ascending orbits dust activity is observed also in India south to the Himalaya and in Eastern China, which is much weaker in descending orbits. Significant differences in mean dust AOD between morning and evening observations occur, especially in Northern India, but also in the Taklimakan desert. Generally dust activity in the Taklimakan as observed by IASI is stronger in April 2009 than in March 2009, while for almost all other regions it is vice versa. /react-text Fig. 3 react-text: 769 . /react-text react-text: 770 Monthly mean AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 772 over Central and East Asia as observed with IASI descending left and ascending right orbits in March top and April bottom 2009.

While dust observations in /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 779 were clearly missing spring time dust activity in the Bodélé Depression Northern Chad , this domain now can be identified as a dust hot spot during ascending observations in both, dust observation frequency and mean AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 781 . Sahelian dust activity is hardly represented in ascending orbit observations, mainly due to cirrus clouds, which easily can be identified from IASI observations, obscuring potential below-cloud dust not shown . Results in /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 783 furthermore totally lacked dust observations over the Rhub-al-Khali in Southern Saudi-Arabia. In the updated version of the retrieval it is clearly evident that IASI observations are now available also over this dust source region. /react-text Fig. 4 react-text: 798 . /react-text react-text: 799 Dust observation frequency top and monthly mean dust AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 801 bottom over Northern Africa and Arabia as observed with IASI descending left and ascending right orbits in March 2009. /react-text Fig. 5 react-text: 810 shows time series of IASI and sun-photometer AOD at 0.5 μm of March and April 2009 for four exemplary AERONET stations.

AERONET observations are coarse mode AOD at 0.5 μm /react-text O'Neill et al., 2003 react-text: 817 , each symbol represents an hourly mean. The stations presented in /react-text Fig. 4 react-text: 819 are Agoufou Mali , La Laguna Canary Islands, Spain , Gwangju Korea and Kanpur India . /react-text Fig. 5 react-text: 834 . /react-text react-text: 835 Time series of AERONET coarse mode only; red crosses and IASI dust; blue diamonds AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 837 for March and April 2009 at the AERONET stations Agoufou, La Laguna, Gwangju and Kanpur. For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article. /react-text react-text: 839 Significant dust events like for example in mid-March in Agoufou are well represented by the IASI dust observations, both qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 841 . There is a generally high agreement between IASI and AERONET observations in the temporal evolution of dust respective coarse mode aerosol activity over the AERONET stations Nevertheless it is also clearly evident that some dust events are not observed by IASI at all partly due to obscuring clouds and some are also strongly underestimated compared to AERONET, as for example in mid-April in Kanpur. /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 845 presents the overall comparison of IASI dust observations with those of 32 AERONET stations, including Central- and East-Asian stations. AERONET observations are coarse mode AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 847 mean of all observations with maximum time difference of half an hour between AERONET observation and Metop IASI overpass for the months of February, March, April dust seasons in the Sahel, over the Arabian Peninsula and in Asia as well as August highest activity of the Western Sahara dust source region , September and October. AERONET observations are only used for evaluation, if at least three observations are available within the one hour time window and if their standard deviation is lower than 30%. /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 862 . /react-text react-text: 863 Evaluation of IASI AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 865 against AERONET coarse mode AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 867 for six months in 2009. Error bars indicate intrinsic uncertainty of the IASI retrieval. /react-text react-text: 869 Error bars at the symbols indicate the intrinsic retrieval uncertainty see /react-text Klüser et al., 2011 react-text: 871 , while the symbol colour represents Ångström exponent between 0.44 μm and 0.87 μm see also /react-text Klüser et al., 2011 react-text: 873 . The linear correlation between IASI derived AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 875 and AERONET coarse mode AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 877 for all 32 stations is /react-text ρ react-text: 879  = 0.757, the root-mean-square difference RMSD is 0.174 and the bias 0.003. Of a total of 413 contemporary IASI and AERONET observations in the three respective months, 190 passed the IASI and AERONET quality filters, and for these 80% of IASI observations lie within AOD±0.2 of AERONET coarse mode AOD. /react-text δ dyn react-text: 883 is defined as the deviation for which the accumulated observation frequency reaches the value 1−e /react-text −1 react-text: 885 , hence representing the dynamically adjusted e /react-text −1 react-text: 887 envelope for the histogram of deviations between satellite observations and AERONET. /react-text δ dyn react-text: 890 is 0.160 for the comparison between IASI dust observations and AERONET coarse mode AOD at 0.5 μm. /react-text react-text: 892 It is evident that the intrinsic uncertainty of the retrieval indicated by error bars in the plot does not reflect all uncertainty of retrieved dust AOD. Moreover the correlation between AERONET AOD and IASI AOD at 0.5 μm is much higher than that between the respective AERONET AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 894 and the firstly retrieved dust AOD /react-text 10 μm react-text: 896 of the IASI retrieval /react-text ρ react-text: 898  = 0.603 , pointing towards a positive impact of the size-dependent transfer function on the observation results. Using a fixed transfer coefficient for the calculation of AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 900 from AOD /react-text 10 μm react-text: 902 thus would underestimate the impact of size distribution on the AOD spectrum. /react-text react-text: 904 Mineral dust may also have fine mode particles contributing to dust optical depth. /react-text Dubovik et al. 2002 react-text: 906 use Ångström exponents smaller than 0.6 as an identifier for dust-dominated aerosol in Bahrain, as small Ångström exponent is related to rather large aerosol particles. The colour coding in /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 908 clearly indicates that there is significant dust contributions to the total aerosol load also in situations with higher Ångström exponent red symbols . These may either have fine mode dust particles as significant part of the dust load, or total aerosol may be composed of other fine mode and dust coarse mode fractions of non-negligible percentage and thus the overall Ångström exponent reflects the large influence of other fine mode aerosol on the slope of the solar range AOD spectrum, as otherwise in /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 910 many apparently good observations would have been rejected. /react-text react-text: 912 Despite the generally good correlation between AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 914 from IASI and AERONET having in mind that the IASI retrieval is in TIR and AERONET AOD is all coarse mode there is a range of outliers where large under- or overestimation of AOD by IASI occurs. Nevertheless, in /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 916 a strong underestimation of high AOD by IASI was observed with the OPAC dust extinction spectra, coming along with a weaker correlation coefficient of /react-text ρ react-text: 918  = 0.623. Hardly any dust AOD above 0.5 was retrieved from IASI with the OPAC based version of the algorithm. This systematic underestimation now has vanished and there is also a better correlation between IASI dust AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 920 and AERONET coarse mode AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 922 . /react-text react-text: 929 The comparison of new IASI dust observations based on extinction spectra of different mineral components with AERONET shows a significant improvement of quantitative dust information from IASI in contrast to the retrieval version with OPAC extinction spectra. The linear correlation between IASI and AERONET observations is improved from the former value of 0.623 to now 0.757. But the main improvement of the new retrieval version is the absence of strong AOD underestimation as it was observed with the OPAC version. While the bias was found to be −0.181 with a corresponding RMSD of 0.322 in /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 931 , the bias now almost totally vanished with a value of 0.003 and the corresponding RMSD was reduced to 0.174 – almost half of the previous value. In /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 933 64% of IASI observations were found within AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 935  ± 0.2 of AERONET observations. This fraction increases to 80% with the use of mineral component extinction spectra. /react-text The comparison with AERONET, including Sahelian stations, gives evidence that the high AOD of the Sahel dust storms in March 2009 is also observed from ground. Also the Northern Arabian dust activity does well match AERONET observations, e.g. of Kuwait University. react-text: 938 Example observations of an Asian dust storm originating from the Taklimakan desert and reaching Central China show the general applicability of the algorithm to other parts of the world. Thus the selection of singular vectors in /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 940 seems to cover most of the relevant spectral variability of surface emissivity and atmospheric extinction, at least at similar latitudes, i.e. in the global dust belt see also /react-text Hatch and Grassian, 2008 react-text: 942 . /react-text react-text: 944 Dust in central Asia Taklimakan and Gobi deserts and adjacent downwind regions is mainly emitted and transported in connection with propagating convective disturbances like e.g. cyclonic fronts /react-text Qian et al., 2002 react-text: 946 ; see also /react-text Fig. 2 react-text: 948 . The regional distribution of dust activity over Asia observed by IASI is in generally good agreement with the results of e.g. /react-text Qian et al. 2002 react-text: 950 , /react-text Jugder et al. 2011 react-text: 952 and /react-text Trivitayanurak et al. 2011 react-text: 954 , also the predominance of spring dust observations over those in August. /react-text react-text: 956 Moreover, /react-text Jugder et al. 2011 react-text: 958 report partly strong diurnal cycles of dust activity for different Mongolian ground-based observation stations. /react-text Natsagdorj et al. 2003 react-text: 960 report spring time dust storms in the Gobi desert being observed mainly in the late afternoon. Especially dust frequency observed from ground is much higher around the time of ascending Metop overpasses compared to the time of morning descending overpasses. This fits well the IASI observations for March and April 2009 for the desert and steppe regions eastward of the Taklimakan /react-text Fig. 3 react-text: 962 . In the Taklimakan desert itself not covered by the analysis of /react-text Natsagdorj et al., 2003 react-text: 964 higher dust AOD is observed in the morning hours with IASI. /react-text Evaluation results against AERONET show the improvement of the method due to the application of mineral component based extinction spectra in contrast to the “single-dust” type OPAC spectra form Mie calculations. The improvement might be due to both, accounting for non-sphericity and for variable mineralogical composition of dust, which has large impact on the shape of TIR extinction spectra.In contrast to the exploitation of OPAC extinction spectra the dust particle size information in the current version is subsequently derived and directly depends on the observed optical depth. Thus it is not to be regarded as independent information and is closely related to the retrieval result of dust optical depth. Analysing the information content of the component based retrieval version with respect to particle size information or dust mass will become the subject of in-depth evaluation in the future.It has been shown that the performance of an IASI dust retrieval based on singular vector decomposition could strongly be improved by using mineral component extinction spectra instead of OPAC dust optical properties. The comparison with AERONET indicates that the IASI dust retrieval is able to represent solar wavelength optical depth quantitatively although being a thermal infrared method. The major advantage of quantitatively reliable dust information from TIR satellite instruments is the observation twice daily and the insensitivity to fine mode aerosols like from biomass burning. react-text: 974 Nevertheless the method still also has some limitations. Iron oxides mainly hematite are of importance for solar wavelength single-scattering albedo of dust e.g. /react-text Mogili et al., 2008 react-text: 976 and also for its nitrification potential far downwind of the source regions e.g. /react-text Jickells et al., 2005 react-text: 978 . The iron oxide content of airborne dust cannot be determined by the current IASI method as the spectral extinction variability of hematite is very weak in the TIR /react-text Mogili et al., 2008 react-text: 980 . The impact of iron oxides on solar wavelength absorption also limits the direct comparability of TIR derived AOD and e.g. AERONET observations, thus it remains unclear how far the deviations between AERONET and IASI derived AOD /react-text 0.5 μm react-text: 982 are the result of variable hematite content. Also other mineral components not covered by the extinction spectra used in the improved IASI retrieval may influence the result and quality of retrieval results. /react-text Moreover there remain some open questions still to be addressed: from AERONET no night time evaluation is possible, thus it yet cannot be concluded finally how reliable the night observations are quantitatively. react-text: 985 The applicability of the method not only over the Saharan-Arabian domain but also over central and Eastern Asia could be shown, both from analysis of spatially gridded dust observations and from comparison with AERONET observations for Asian sites. This conclusion does not necessarily imply global applicability of the method, as also the Asian regions considered here are at latitudes as those analysed in /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 987 , namely in the dust belt between 0°N and 45°N. But nevertheless the evaluation shows that the singular vectors, which have not been changed from the /react-text Klüser et al. 2011 react-text: 989 version and have been derived over the Sahara and Arabian Peninsula together with adjacent ocean regions, are also applicable outside the region of their origin. /react-text Although positive impact of size-dependent TIR-visible transfer coefficients driven by particle size information derived from the retrieved optical depth and component weights has been shown, the size information is not regarded to be quantitatively applicable so far. Further efforts are needed to evaluate the information content of the mineral components based dust observations with respect to particle size. Moreover it will be interesting to see, if the mineralogical information dust component weights may help to further improve the transfer coefficients from thermal infrared to visible wavelengths. react-text: 992 The impact of mineral dust on convective clouds is of large interest /react-text IPCC, 2007 react-text: 994 ; /react-text Klüser and Holzer-Popp, 2010 react-text: 996 . IASI also offers great advantages for remote sensing of ice clouds independently from solar illumination as for dust . Thus the improved dust retrieval method is very well suited for analysing quantitatively the impact of mineral dust on deep convective clouds and their ice water content in different parts of the world. Moreover the improved quantification of atmospheric dust burden in terms of AOD may also have very positive impact on assimilation of satellite based dust information into air quality models and thus increase air quality information in remote areas without dense networks of ground-based information. /react-text "
404,dust,"Spatiotemporal patterns of Saharan dust outbreaks in the Mediterranean Basin. Saharan dust outbreaks transport appreciable amounts of mineral particles into the atmosphere of the Mediterranean Basin. Atmospheric particulates have significant impacts on numerous atmospheric, climatic and biogeochemical processes. The recognition of background drivers, spatial and temporal variations of the amount of Saharan dust particles in the Mediterranean can lead to a better understanding of possible past and future environmental effects of atmospheric dust in the region. For this study the daily NASA Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer’s and Ozone Monitoring Instrument’s aerosol data 1979–2012 were employed to estimate atmospheric dust amount. Daily geopotential height, wind vector and meridional flow data of the distinguished dust events were obtained from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis to compile mean synoptic composite maps. In order to identify the typical dust transportation routes and possible source areas, the backward trajectories were plotted using the NOAA HYSPLIT model. The main period of the dust transportation is from March to end of August, when the thermal convective activity forces the injection of particles to higher atmospheric levels. However, seasonality patterns of the different Mediterranean sub-basins show quite large differences. In western sub-basins, the maxima of Saharan dust outbreaks is in summer, related southwest flow between a southward emanating trough and the northward migrating subtropical high-pressure centre. In the eastern basin, dust storms occur typically in spring, generated by the warm sector winds on foreside of eastward moving Mediterranean and Sharav cyclones. The seasonal distribution of dust events in the central sub-basins shows a bimodal characteristic with a spring and summer peak.  react-text: 304 Atmospheric mineral dust particles are standing in the focal point of recent climatic and various environmental investigations /react-text Stout et al., 2009 react-text: 306 .

However, the frequency and magnitude of dust intrusions show a wide spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variability across the basin. According to our systematic analysis of daily TOMS and TOMS-like AI measurements between 1979 and 2012, Saharan dust could be identified in 23.5% of all measurements in the Western basin Alboran and Balearic Seas , in 29.5% in the Central Mediterranean Tyrrhenian and Ionian Seas, Sea of Sicily and in 33.75% in the Eastern Mediterranean.High amplitude variations determine the annual time series of dusty episodes, with outstanding years of 1984, 1985, 1988, 1999, 2000 and 2008, while the lowest values of annual dust contributions were identified in 1979, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1990 and 2011. The inter-annual year-to-year indices of the different sub-basins are correlating well linear correlation coefficients: Western–Central basins: 0.80; Central–Eastern basins: 0.86; Western–Eastern basins: 0.58 . In general, the frequency of dust outbreaks cannot be unequivocally explained by the changing nature of large scale atmospheric oscillations, circulation patterns or by drought periods. react-text: 587 However, it has previously been documented that during periods of NAO positive phases drier conditions prevail in North-Africa and the frequency of dust outbreaks increase /react-text Cusack et al., 2013; Pey et al. 2013 react-text: 589 . /react-text Pey et al. 2013 react-text: 591 have identified a relatively strong correlation between summer North Atlantic Oscillation NAO indices and annual Saharan dust contribution to PM /react-text 10 react-text: 593 concentration in some parts of the NW Mediterranean between 2006 and 2011 . However, according to our analyses, the relationship of TOMS and OMI AI with both NAO and summer NAO is uncertain for larger areas and for longer periods. Such issues of teleconnections and relationships deserve further investigations in the future. /react-text react-text: 596 Atmospheric dust content shows clear seasonal patterns across the different sub-basins /react-text Fig. 2 react-text: 598 . The main period of Saharan dust intrusions across the Mediterranean is from March to end of August. At these times the atmosphere of North Africa is heavily loaded with dust and the dust outbreaks are primarily determined by synoptic meteorological conditions /react-text Israelevich et al., 2002 react-text: 600 . The dusty period begins in the early spring in the Eastern Mediterranean and the centres of highest dust concentrations are displaced from east to west from March to September. The AI patterns move back eastwards in September, when dust loadings reduce in the Western basin as a result of the southward migration of the subtropical high pressure belt, while the cyclone activity remain perceptible in the eastern parts. Similar seasonality patterns with March to July maximum in the Eastern Mediterranean and May to August peak in the Central and Western basins were published in several previous studies e.g. /react-text Moulin et al., 1998; Barkan et al., 2005; Dayan et al., 2007; Israelevich et al., 2012; Pey et al., 2013; Gkikas et al., 2013 react-text: 602 . /react-text Fig. 2 react-text: 613 . /react-text react-text: 614 Monthly mean TOMS aerosol maps of the Mediterranean Sea 1979–2012 . /react-text react-text: 617 The different spatial distribution of the two main seasons of dust contributions could be well identified at meridional transect-analysis plots, where the Aerosol Indices were calculated along seven vectors for the interval of April and July two distinct months with intense but spatially diverse dust loading patterns /react-text Fig. 3 react-text: 619 . The diagrams clearly demonstrate that at the Eastern basin the April, while at the Western basin the July values are the highest. Dust load into the atmosphere of Central Mediterranean is fairly high in both April and July, so it can be regarded as a transitional area between the two external basins /react-text Pey et al., 2013 react-text: 621 . /react-text Fig. 3 react-text: 632 . /react-text react-text: 633 Meridional transect-analysis of the Mediterranean Basin. TOMS AI values were calculated along the marked 7 vectors. /react-text The AI values of the meridional vectors in both cases reflect a decreasing gradient as a function of distance from the African coast. The steeper slope of AI values implies a different kind of dust transportation mechanism and a more evident south–north gradient of intense dust outbreaks. The different seasonal transects are results of the governing different synoptic meteorological situations, which have strong seasonal dependence, as it will discussed in the next section of the paper. react-text: 636 Albeit, the value of AI not only depends on the presence and amount absorbing aerosol particles, but both the transport height and sub-pixel cloud contamination affect it, nevertheless, based on the relatively strong correlation between AI and several other quantitative aerosol products /react-text Kubilay et al., 2005; Kalivitis et al., 2007 react-text: 638 , we can state that the latitudinal decrease of meridional vectors are primarily governed by the distance from the African coast.

This seasonal distribution pattern is a logical consequence of the synoptic meteorological background of Western Mediterranean dust events as they are controlled by the summer northward migration of the subtropical high-pressure belt. The two separated high cells between 30°N and 35°N, and also a north–south oriented trough can be clearly seen at the mean synoptic map of dust events /react-text Fig. 4 react-text: 657 . The strong southwestern flow ∼10–11 /react-text react-text: 658   /react-text react-text: 659 m/s of dust outbreaks is generated by the steep pressure gradient between the southward emanating deep trough along the western coast of North Africa and the eastern cell of the divided subtropical high-pressure centre over NW Africa.

The bimodal seasonality pattern is a result of two predominant synoptic situations. Regarding the springtime dust outbreaks, the main governing atmospheric centre is an eastward moving depression located over the Western Mediterranean and North Africa. Southerly flow is generated by the warm sector winds on foreside of the cyclone.

Only a slight difference can be observed in the position of governing pressure centres. The southward emanating deep trough locates nearer to the Atlantic coast of Africa and the high pressure centre situates further east, at ∼35°N and ∼10°E.

Eastern Mediterranean dust events are connected to eastward moving atmospheric depressions. Two different types of low pressure systems can be distinguished in the daily analyses: Sharav cyclones and mid-latitude Mediterranean cyclones /react-text Fig. 7 react-text: 739 a and b . The shallow Sharav cyclones develop at the southern side of the Atlas Mountains as a consequence of steep thermal gradient between the heated continent and the colder sea.

Major sources are associated to specific geomorphological environments. These can be connected to geomorphological depressions, ephemeral streams or wadi-systems and to alluvial fans.

This large depression situates northeast from the Lake Chad, once having been part of the large Lake Mega-Chad /react-text Washington et al., 2003 react-text: 793 . The fine-grained unconsolidated material of the emissions originates from diatomite deposits of the ancient lakebed, nowadays a series of ephemeral and dry-lakes. Though, the most prominent dust transportation route is from NE to SW towards the Gulf of Guinea /react-text McTainsh and Walker, 1982 react-text: 795 , in some cases Bodélé can be assumed as the source area of spring outbreaks in the Central Mediterranean Basin /react-text Koltay et al., 2006 react-text: 797 . /react-text react-text: 799 The Azawagh Azaouak structural basin is an isolated spot of high dust activity 1.2 framed by the Adrar des Ifoghas, by the Thassili du Hoggar and by the Aïr Mountains. This region was the catchment area of an ancient northern tributary of the Niger River during the Pleistocene pluvial periods /react-text Paris, 1995 react-text: 801 . The alluvial deposits and the system of ephemeral streams originating from the foothills of Ahaggar Hoggar and the Aïr are the sources of the fine-grained loose mineral material. /react-text react-text: 803 The remnant of the Pleistocene pluvial lake Araouane in the southern part of the Taoudenni Basin, NW from the large bend of Niger River and west from the Adrar des Ifoghas, is an extensive dust source area /react-text Bridges, 1990 react-text: 805 . Salt and diatomite deposits of the ancient lakebed can be clearly seen on satellite images and the surface of the enclosed basin is partly covered by extensive system of barchan dunes formed by the prevailing NE trade winds. In fact, the dust emission mechanism of the region may resemble that of the Bodélé Depression; the bombardment energy of saltating sand particles leads to intensive deflation of the fine-grained particles of lacustrine deposits and enhances dust emission. /react-text react-text: 807 At the eastern slopes of gentle hills running parallel to the Atlantic coast a long narrow band of dust sources is located at the western part of the Sahara 1.4 . The series of seasonal streams with frequent flash floods in the spring, and sebkhas e.g. Sebkha Ijil at the pedimented surface of the Adrar Souttouf and Zemmour Massif bounded by large sand seas, are acting as the main sources of fine-grained material in this region. Mineral deposits of the area are characterised by high illite/kaolinite ratio, high calcite content and are occasionally rich in palygorskite /react-text Scheuvens et al., 2013 react-text: 809 . /react-text react-text: 811 Large alluvial fans and complex wadi-systems at the W and NW slopes of the Ahaggar are acting as an extensive dust source area 1.5 .

The heterogeneous mineral composition of source sediments high kaolinite, sporadic palygorskite and occasionally increased carbonate content makes it difficult to identify dust storms originated from this region only by their geochemical characteristics. /react-text Clearly, the dust activity of the above discussed regions shows similar variability throughout the year. The atmospheric dust concentration is at a maximum in late spring and summer, and the dust emission of these sources is primary governed by the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone ITCZ and thermal convective activity of the hottest seasons. react-text: 816 At the southern foreland of the Tell Atlas, a system of salt and dry lakes represents an isolated dust hot-spot area 1.6 . Dust emission seems to be largest between Chott Melrhir and Chott Jerid salt lakes, lying north to the Grand Erg Oriental /react-text Prospero et al., 2002 react-text: 818 . Especially, Sharav and Mediterranean cyclones transport dust from the zone of chotts /react-text Alpert and Ziv, 1989; Kalderon-Asael et al., 2009 react-text: 820 . Similar atmospheric circulation patterns are responsible for dust emission from the dusty area expanding from the northern hillslopes of Tibesti through Cyrenaica to the Qattara Depression 1.7 and from the low-lying areas next to the north–south orienting escarpments along the Nile 1.8 . For these sources, the main period of dust transportation is in spring with a secondary maximum in summer. /react-text The regional climatology of TOMS and OMI TOMS-like AI was discussed for the entire Mediterranean region in the period between 1979 and 2012. This study demonstrates that Saharan dust particles are essential components of the Mediterranean atmosphere, especially during spring and summer seasons. This period has been identified as the major interval of high dust loading of the atmosphere over the Sahara, due to the activity of dust source areas as emitters of wind-blown mineral particles. Obviously, the meteorological factors behind determine the dust transport. Two different types of synoptic situations are associated with Saharan dust outbreaks in the Mediterranean Basin. During spring mineral particles are carried on the foreside of eastward moving low-pressure systems, responsible for dust events in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean sub-basins. Summer dust episodes are found to be connected to the northward migration of the subtropical high-pressure belt. Regarding the formation of southward moving troughs in the Eastern Atlantic, strong SW flow transports dust towards the Western and Central Mediterranean regions. Depending on the different type of meteorological situations, different areas could serve as dust source regions. As one of the most intense dust source areas, the Bodélé Depression remnant of ancient Lake Mega-Chad serves only as occasional source of fine-grained particles of Mediterranean dust outbreaks. At the same time, the Azawagh structural basin alluvial deposits and ephemeral streams , the Taoudenni Basin deposits of Pleistocene Lake Araouane , the Western Saharan sebkhas and ephemeral streams, the Tidikelt Depression, the Ahaggar wadis, Chott Melrhir and Chott Jerid salt lakes , the extensive wadi-system of Cyrenaica and Qattara Depressions and low-lying areas next to the N-S orienting escarpments along the Nile are identified to be the main source regions of Saharan dust storms delivering high amounts of mineral particles to the Mediterranean Basin."
405,dust aerosol,"Improved algorithm for MODIS satellite retrievals of aerosol optical thickness over land in dusty atmosphere: Implications for air quality monitoring in China. A new algorithm, using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS satellite reflectance and aerosol single scattering properties simulated from a chemistry transport model GEOS-Chem , is developed to retrieve aerosol optical thickness AOT over land in China during the spring dust season. The algorithm first uses a “dynamic lower envelope” approach to sample the MODIS dark-pixel reflectance data in low AOT conditions, to derive the local surface visible 0.65 μm /near infrared NIR, 2.1 μm reflectance ratio. Joint retrievals of AOT at 0.65 μm and surface reflectance at 2.1 μm are then performed, based on the time, location, and spectral-dependent single scattering properties of the dusty atmosphere as simulated by the GEOS-Chem. A linearized vector radiative transfer model VLIDORT that simultaneously computes the top-of-atmosphere reflectance and its Jacobian with respect to AOT, is used in the forward component of the inversion of MODIS reflectance to AOT. Comparison of retrieved AOT results in April and May of 2008 with AERONET observations shows a strong correlation R = 0.83 , with small bias 0.01 , and small RMSE 0.17 ; the figures are a substantial improvement over corresponding values obtained with the MODIS Collection 5 AOT algorithm for the same study region and time period. The small bias is partially due to the consideration of dust effect at 2.1 μm channel, without which the bias is − 0.05. The surface PM10 particulate matter with diameter less than 10 μm concentrations derived using this improved AOT retrieval show better agreement with ground observations than those derived from GEOS-Chem simulations alone, or those inferred from the MODIS Collection 5 AOT. This study underscores the value of using satellite reflectance to improve the air quality modeling and monitoring.  react-text: 1626 Atmospheric aerosol is a major concern for climate prediction and public health, but records of global aerosol distributions have only become available in the last decade from dedicated satellite observations such as MODIS /react-text Remer et al., 2008 react-text: 1628 and the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer MISR /react-text Kahn et al., 2005 react-text: 1630 .

The radiance or reflectance data collected by currently operational passive remote sensing instruments for aerosol retrieval are mostly at the atmospheric window channels in the visible spectrum. Therefore, they offer little information on aerosol vertical distribution beyond the retrieval of columnar properties such as aerosol optical thickness AOT /react-text Wang et al., 2003a react-text: 1634 .

Indeed, the MODIS C5 AOT retrievals show a similar retrieval error pattern with the scattering angle to our AOT retrievals, except the former have a clear positive bias /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 3196 b . We argue that the lack of a distinct effect due to dust non-spherical particle phase functions on our retrieval as shown in /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 3198 appears consistent with the findings by /react-text Li and Osada 2007 react-text: 3200 , who showed that only spherical dust particles are persistent downwind of desert regions, because of the preferential settling of elongated dust particles. /react-text Fig. 6 react-text: 3215 . /react-text react-text: 3216 a Relative retrieval error of aerosol optical thickness at 0.65 /react-text react-text: 3217   /react-text react-text: 3218 μm in this work AOT /react-text this-work react-text: 3220 with respect to the AOT measured from AEROENT AOT /react-text AEROENT react-text: 3222 as a function of scattering angles. b same as a but for retrieval error of AOT from MODIS C5 AOT /react-text modis-C5 react-text: 3224 .

However, our algorithm differs from previous approaches in the following aspects: 1 the use of a “dynamic lower envelope” regression to derive locally the surface visible/NIR reflectance ratios on a daily basis, 2 the removal of atmospheric dust effects when applying the NIR reflectance at the top-of-atmosphere to derive surface reflectance, and 3 the use of the Jacobian of reflectance with respect to aerosol optical thickness to update the retrieved AOT and to fasten the convergence between the modeled and MODIS measured reflectance. Because our dynamical lower envelope approach for deriving surface visible/near infrared reflectance ratio uses the MODIS data over a 40-day period centered on the day of the retrieval, our algorithm is not suitable for operational purposes. However, the promising results shown in this study certainly make the approach an attractive option for re-analysis of AOT and surface aerosol concentration, particularly at a regional scale. /react-text react-text: 3239 Key assumptions in our approach of retrieving aerosol optical thickness and surface aerosol concentration are: 1 GEOS-Chem simulated vertical shape of mass mixing ratio of different aerosol component are kept constant in the retrieval; 2 a generic database of the single scattering properties of each aerosol component /react-text Koepke et al., 1997 react-text: 3241 with update from /react-text Drury et al. 2010 react-text: 3243 is used in the retrieval; 3 the shape of surface bidirectional reflectance in the visible and near infrared are assumed to be the similar and so that the relationship between visible and near infrared surface reflectance is linear; this assumption has been used in various aerosol retrieval algorithms including those designed for MODIS /react-text Levy et al., 2007; Lyapustin and Wang, 2009 react-text: 3245 and MISR /react-text Diner et al., 2005 react-text: 3247 , although the methods used in these studies for deriving the ratio between surface visible and near infrared reflectance are different from our “dynamical lower envelope” approach. Hence, the challenges for next steps include the retrieval of aerosol size and aerosol composition from the multi-spectral multi-angle satellite data, as well as the improved estimate of surface reflectance. However, the large RMSEs in all three estimates of PM /react-text 10 react-text: 3249 using model only, model with MODIS C5 AOT, and model with MODIS reflectance shown in /react-text Fig. 4 react-text: 3251 d–f certainly highlights the critical need of constraint for aerosol profile, at least for the GEOS-Chem modeling in the region of this study. /react-text "
